I think we said something like \"Whoa whoa! That's some extreme language\" and she said, \"That's okay, he's my friend.\" My boyfriend pointed at me and said, \"Well he's my BOYfriend, so please don't use that word.\" She responded with something like, \"I should just keep my mouth shut.\" (Side note: that's true.)\n",

      "You all are talking crazy talk! This bar is amazing. It just depends what you're looking for. Me? I'm looking for a real dive that reminds me of my former and beloved days in Columbus, Ohio. And if you, too, are looking for what I describe below, Tommy's is as good as it gets.\n",
      "\n",
      "It's all of two feet by two feet inside, and there is poorly written graffiti on the walls decrying \"Tommy's Fuckin' Tavern\" or something equally ridiculous like that.  You will most assuredly get bashed in the middle with a pool cue, because most of the two feet by two feet are being used up by a very popular pool table. I was astounded to find locals of the Midwestern  type inside Tommy's - and can't help but wonder if these misshapen Iron Maiden-tshirt-wearing folk are in fact transplants from my beloved former place of residence. The drink menu for Tommy's is - wait for it - poorly scrawled on a piece of printer paper and taped up behind the bar. I ordered a beer in a can called a Schaeffer, and it was joyously anticlimactic. Tosh.0 was on the TV, but this was readily drowned out by such choice jukebox selections as Social Distortion, Metallica, and yes, Rancid. This experience was completed by the fact that some very rough-around-the-edges looking lesbians were making out in the corner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, it might sound like the Midwest - and Tommy's - are places you never, ever want to go. And let me tell you, maybe you don't. After all, someone else's review says something is a bit \"off\" about this place. And it's true. However, this is by no means the epitome of the Midwest, just the seedy underbelly of the Midwest (endearing in the way that 1970s Times Square porn houses are endearing) that I have never seen before in New York... until Tommy's. My cousin and I walked by it looking for Saint Vitus a couple weeks ago, and though Tommy's doesn't havea  sign, some bearded down-home gentlemen were hanging around outside, and we both agreed that whatever that place was, it would be an \"Ohio bar\"... and we right.\n",

Once I saw glass and blood on the sidewalk outside of this bar and my roommate told me that it's nicknamed the \"stab bar.\" One evening I was offered coke and a trip to Atlantic City by some local patrons.  I have since seen the woman that offered me a trip to AC outside of a laundry mat. I don't think she remembered me or the promised trip. I plan on going back to refresh her memory and see if I can still tag along.\n",

      "I went to a birthday show that was held here for it's dive-y atmosphere. From all accounts I would think that was the most people that place had seen in a single night- you'd think that the bartender would be thrilled at the prospect of all those tips- but it just seemed like she was pissed that she had to work at all.  Her mixed drinks were decidedly missing alcohol- and when I ordered a round of shots in honor of my boyfriend's birthday (okay, this may sound gross- it's half whiskey half Jager- try it!) she had the nerve to roll her eyes and make a snide comment... and then proceeded to charge me $7/shot.  Whatever- that was only $56... at least I saw her pour them, and it was actually alcohol (compared to my first drink).  I totally was stupid enough to tip her like $9- her attitude still didn't improve.  I mean seriously?!  Anyway, stick with beer and shots if you see the skinny, miserable blond with the tats behind the bar.\n",

      "Warning to other NYC bands! If you book a gig here be prepared to bring everything you own. The only thing this place has as far as equipment is a p.a. system and a barebones one at that. No microphones, a couple of shotty cables, and some mic stands. You'll be lucky if  you even get a sound guy to help you find the working cables in the rat pit of tangled chords and cables that are by the mixing board. You'll probably have to do your own sound too. Don't count trying to get a hold of the bar before your gig either. They'll never contact you back, and their website hasn't been updated since we were all using dial-up. I'm not saying we had a bad gig, because you can make it work, but this ain't like the other places you book gigs in NYC.  Beer was cheap, whiskey was watered down.\n",
