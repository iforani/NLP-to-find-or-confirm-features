I ate here over the weekend at the new outdoor dining section that they've setup on Stone Street. Nice lamps on the tables, excellent service, food as good as ever.

This has been a tough time for all restaurants but Harry's really did a nice job going the extra mile to create a great experience with social distancing and was a welcomed change from eating out of cardboard boxes! If you're looking for an experience as close to pre-COVID 19 as possible, yet, with all the precautions, this is the place.

Steak was cooked perfectly and the prosciutto appetizer was excellent.

I even signed up to write a review for this place. One of the best restaurant experiences ever in every aspect despite all the challenges due to an unprecedented situation with COVID. The ribeye steak, complimentary Moet Chandon, but most of all, the service. What a memorable meal. It's worth every single penny. I really appreciated all the efforts the restaurant staff put and will come back to NYC just to visit this place. I can't wait for the day I can eat inside Harry's.

Its a horrible experience with cheap razors and rude customer service with reduced business hours and they don't care if they are rude and you ask for a supervisor they will hang up on you after they leave you waiting for 5 minutes
I DO NOT RECOMMEND THEM AND WILL NEVER USE THEM EVER AGAIN
I much rather stay with the awesome experience I've had with dollar shave club at least their products have never broken on me.

Came here for my birthday brunch this past weekend. I was looking for something cute and simple and they offered endless champagne for brunch so I was sold.

The service was great for the most part. Right when you enter the hostess checks your temperature. We all end up ordering the Steak and Eggs. Only problem was that I was the only one that ordered Medium Rare and all my friends ordered medium or medium well. BUT they all got medium rare some of their steaks looked bloodier than mine. I told them to ask to see if they can cook the steaks more to their liking, but they didn't want to bother even though I look on their faces seemed like they were struggling to eat the steak. The steak was a little tough as well. The rest of the food was ok. We ended up asking for some salt and pepper everything was a bit bland not really what I had expected. Sadly the only thing that stood out was the bread basket :/ For a bit it was hard to get someones attention for refills of champagne, but after I asked if it was ok to keep a bottle they were more attentive which was nice. The waitress was nice and gave us some more bread and butter to eat sadly more satisfying than the steak. We got the creme brulee for my birthday, but I don't think they are allowed to do candles anymore. That was actually pretty good.

Overall service was nice, but the steaks especially with 4 of the steaks not being cooked properly made me knock rating down. The endless brunch is a good deal compared to most so I suggest trying the other items even though it is a steakhouse.

We sat outside on a cool summer night during CoVID which was interesting. If you like smelling weed and homeless people literally laying nearby, this is the place for you! They have paper menus and are trying to social distance the tables. The waitstaff wear masks which is reassuring. It's a crazy time and they seem to be doing well so we are giving it a try! Tuna crudo is yellow fin and zero flavor and the scrimp scampi was also bland, maybe because I'm a good cook? The bathroom is GROSS!!!  They also tried to pull a fast one and charge us $222 for food we didn't order!! I sent the check back!!

Randomly dropped in to Harry's while walking through the financial district with some friends. We were intrigued by steps leading down into the main dining area. It's a beautiful space elegantly decorated with a timeless feel.

We simply dropped in for a couple drinks. Macallan 12 Year. I'm not a hard person to please in these places. Great place to space to enjoy quality whiskey, and conversation.

I hear the steaks are also incredible, so I'll have to pop back in the next time I'm in New York.

Disappointed on this 2nd Brunch Visit. Harrys has a lovely decor for a leisurely brunch.

This time we tried the Poached Eggs Benedict on smoked Salmon toast - it was cold and needed to be sent back to the kitchen. 5 minutes later it came back out - still only Luke warm. For $26 they can do better. My Steak Sandwich with gruyere and hand cut fries was good, but not great- served warm, wnot hot.

Jose did a good job with the service and the unlimited champagne is a great plus. The blood orange juice was delicious but no juice glasses were provided. The coffee is great as were the polenta fries stack.

Hidden down a set of classic stairs (think TV show Cheers) just a coins throw from the New York Stock Exchange is the the International Bank of Brunch - AKA  Harry's.

Take a classic steakhouse with its excellent wait staff (Jorge) and excellent Managers and add in delicious mouthwatering food and unlimited Champagne for 90 minutes and you have Harry's Brunch.

Picture ice cold champagne flutes constantly filled at no extra cost, blood orange juice carafe at $7 and great rich Columbia coffee $4 then add to these beverages:

A three egg omelette with super melty gruyere cheese and perfectly cooked crisp hash browns with toast triangles dipped in melted butter with parsley - $18

Then add on super thick French toast with fresh berries and real maple syrup with confectioners sugar and some unusual spice like nutmeg or vanilla bean - $19

Then we added the best thing ever- Polenta Fries ($12) stacked like firewood, a total of 6 perfect rectangular logs served super hot and crispy with an aioli mayonnaise. These logs were like "orgasms" in a bite.

Add the Champagne and our entrees and we didn't want to leave.

So my friends - invest in the Harry's Bank of Brunch for a solid return of fun and delicious food!

Their brunch menu has been expanded and it's fantastic. The Bennies Benedict it's still they all time favorite. Bronzino was fantastic the champagne flows endlessly. Service was terrific and the manager from Ulysses Santiago Pitched in and was on his game. The shrimp cocktail is large and tasty. By far one of the best brunches in the financial district.

This place is huge but every area your seated in is comfortable. You're so tempted to order a NY Steak but the Rib Eye is by far the best cut of meat and excellent. Christopher the captain knows his wines if your a wine guy
and he's a jolly professional on all levels of dining as is the entire staff. All appetizes from the sauteed mushrooms to lump crab meat to barbecue shrimp all great. This place is not cheap especially dinner but if you split the Rib Eye which is possible the meal becomes a value if you're not coming here because it's pricey. Because it's a big space you never need a reservation and serves late.

Went to brunch this weekend with some girlfriends and it was a 10/10 experience. Attentive service, champagne was flowing endlessly and in disbelief of the price. The cost of entree covers the bottomless service. We ended up staying over 3 hours.... THANK YOU HARRYS!

Tried and true. A few words I'd use to describe Harry's would be elegant, timeless and reliable. Returning to Harry's after a long lapse was like visiting an old friend. I've a soft spot for Harry's.

Known as a steakhouse (and more), Harry's is a must visit for their killer brunches. With the exception of a few tweaks (prices and varieties of champagne), their brunches include 90 minutes of unlimited champagne. This has not changed since I first visited in 2008 and I swear our unlimited champagne  topped at nearly 2 hours.

All champagne brunches are complimentary with an entree order except soups or salads AND you must order a small carafe of juice (peach, orange, grapefruit or blood orange at $7) as an accompaniment although our other friend drank her champagne straight.

I'm not a huge champagne lover, but with the ambience and style that Harry's exudes, it is fitting. Of course you may order other beverages, alcohol or otherwise.

Service was impeccable throughout our entire brunch with several staff tending to us at different times. My friend and I ordered the Eggs Benedict with Smoked Salmon ($26) while another selected the Cacio e Pepe Spaghetti.

My dish was cooked to perfection--delicious and a filling portion. We all agreed that we were beyond satisfied with our meals and the time we spent there to have a holiday brunch. Cozy and classic. My kind of ambience.

I'd like to return to Harry's more often for brunch and dinner (I've been in the past) but for now, highly recommending this gem on Hanover Street.

I went with coworkers for a lunch at Harry's and thought the food was pretty good. The service was a bit slow but It does get crowded so I would suggest making a reservation if you're going with a group.

For the table, we ordered the Jonah Crab Cake, Baked Clams Genovese, Prosciutto di Parma, and House Smoked Canadian Bacon.

My favorite was the House Smoked Canadian Bacon because it was cooked just right. It wasn't too oily or dry and came in a pretty good portion. It was really quite tasty.

All of the other apps were pretty average but the Jonah Crab Cake was better than most other places. It was lightly fried, had a good amount of crab meat, and came with a nice remoulade sauce.

I ordered the Hanger Steak and appreciated how it came in three separate pieces. The steak was cooked medium rare plus and was really easy to cut into. The outside and inside were cooked just how I like it.

I returned to Harry's for dinner without a reservation this past week.  While it was louder than usual/preferred, this was due to the private party next door which is simply an unfortunate reality of dining at this time of year in many establishments.  Despite the private party, the host was able to find us a quieter table tucked away in a really cool glass enclosure separating the bar from the main dining area.

We were only there for drinks and snacks, but every component far exceeded expectations.  The Oysters Rockefeller were delicious, cheesy with a healthy amount of spinach, and finished off by the spritz of lemon from the wedge on the plate.  The French Onion Soup (which is called Onion Soup Au Gratin at Harry's) was the highlight of my guests' trip to NYC (which also included meals at The Fulton and Delmonico's) despite the fact they only smelled it.  Needless to say, to some, the onion soup is phenomenal.  The hanger steak was cooked as ordered and was flavorful.

I have to include a nod to the wine list for including a pinot noir from Alsace by the glass (in addition to the usual Willamette Valley); it's always fun to try two wines from the same region back to back.

Thanks for the reliably delicious meal!

I stopped by Harry's for brunch this past Sunday.  Located in the basement of an older building on the corner of Stone Street, Harry's makes up for its subterranean seating with a classic interior with a modern twist.  Dark woods, with a fun and unique center piece lighting and private lockers with VIPs' liquor I assume, the interior feels as if it can fall on both the more formal or the more casual side depending on your needs for the meal.  We were promptly seated around noon on a Saturday, and informed that the restaurant has recently expanded its hours to include Sunday as well.

Our server was very attentive and personable, and offered us complimentary sparkling water (which can run you $8 a bottle at other establishments) shortly after we were seated. One of the biggest draws here is the complimentary hour and a half of sparkling wine, which one should most definitely supplement with a juice of your choice.  We went with blood orange for this visit, and the tartness was a great accent to the sparkling wine (we'd previously ordered the peach nectar during a previous visit, and while good, the peach puree or pulp ended up rising to the top of the glass, making the drink appear unappetizing).  Our server was very prompt with the refills of the sparkling wine, which is much appreciated compared to other establishments.

As a sucker for corn beef hash, I opted for this entree for my meal. Our server assured both me and my girlfriend that the meal came with home fries, which turned out to be a mistake.  As noted in other reviews, it comes with a little side salad that, without more, will leave you hungry.  Once our order of home fries arrived (after we had finished our meal) they were fresh and delicious, and honestly one of the highlights of the meal.

While I understand the $24 price tag builds in the "complimentary" sparkling wine, the portions of the corn beef hash were a little disappointing.  Served in a tower like a tartare, the corn beef could use some crisping before service, and the eggs, while runny, were bordering on under-cooked, with the egg whites still retaining some clear portions.  Further, if it was spread out on the plate a bit more, both eggs could fit on top of it, making it feel a bit more like a composed bite, rather than a tower of corn beef with a handful of salad and some sliced toast.  Lastly, to the point about the toast, the word "biscuit" is thrown around liberally.  the corn beef hash does not come with a biscuit; it comes with quartered toast.  Similarly, the meal does not start off with a biscuit, it is slices of raisin bread with a strawberry jam.  Neither the toast nor the raisin bread were bad, but don't raise my expectations for a biscuit unnecessarily, as its an unforced error in the customer experience.

Lastly, when we asked for our check, our server made us feel somewhat awkward since we were asking to pay before the end of our complimentary sparkling wine time period.  He was very personable and friendly, just don't try and question why we're trying to get the check.

I'm certain I'll be back at some point, especially if the goal is a boozy brunch in the neighborhood, but there is certainly room for improvement around the edges of an otherwise solid brunch.

Brought a VIP client here. Place is warm and comforting. Service was meh. Could have been more attentive.  We ordered NY strip, ribeye, scallops, baked clams steak tartar, Caesar salad, soup, fries, asparagus and broccolini dessert, wine cocktail, etc.  Bill was $500

Every dish was very  average and can't believe their fries was a disgusting soggy mess. This is elementary and I thought it was completely unacceptable that they could not even get the fries right.

And I  ordered my  ribeye medium rare and it came medium.

At this price point, I had expected so much more.  I do not expect to return.

This review is based on their weekend brunch.

Food: I ordered the steak and eggs which was amazing! You know the steak has to be good because it is a steakhouse! Though some of the entrees were a bit pricey, that's the price to pay for quality meat!

Drinks: Unlimited bubbles for 1.5 hours with entree purchase is such a great deal! You can add mixers for about $5 more which is great if you love mimosas or bellinis.

Service: The service was on-point! The staff were constantly making rounds making sure our champagne glasses never go empty and the food came out very quickly. I was surprised how attentive and quick they were at filling our glasses!

Vibes: Very classy and upscale vibe which is great if you want to impress your date or even if you have friends coming over!

Overall, great value for the brunch with superb waitstaff and delicious food!

It's been decades since I last had dinner at Harry's, forgot just how enjoyable a meal they offer.

I was professionally greeted and seated early and my drink was delivered promptly and expertly prepared.

My bone in ribeye was tremendous!

Absolutely a great meal!!

The second star was gained entirely due to the professionalism of the manager of Harry's and the wonderful bus boy who picked up my horrible waiter's (Enrico FYI) slack. Enrico spilled champagne over our table without saying sorry or bringing a towel. We were left to eat on a sticky wet table. This was the kind of meal where I kept an open note of bullet points on my phone about how horribly awry things went.

To start our table wasn't ready when we arrived- which ok New York brunch at 1 pm on Sunday is par for the course. We went to the bar then and ordered espresso martinis. The bar service was slow so we ended up heading to our table before the martinis were ready- also fine and normal. However 20 minutes and a reminder to the bus boy (again the waiter was a mere mirage for the meal) to get them and they came without baileys, again preference but I was shocked when I was charged 14 dollars per shot of baileys on top of a 16 dollar martini. I know it's New York- but I've never paid 30 dollars for a drink that didn't come with gold or a lobster tail attached.

We were served our first champagne at 38 minutes into a 90 min time limit for the champagne brunch. Which yes, is 7 minutes short of half our entire allotted time. Also note here, we asked for blood orange and got what I'm pretty sure is Minute Maid standard OJ.

They also were out of the steak and eggs by 1 pm. Also out of bread. Since we didn't get a drink until 38 min in, we had ordered a side of hash browns and fries to put something in our stomachs.

What ended up happening though is that the first round of champagne came 2 min after our martinis and our  entrees within 30 seconds of that. Ignored for the first forty minutes and then two drinks and entrees at once. Horrible timing for a leisurely meal.

I honestly was excited for some good ole red meat at Harry's- you know as it is a steakhouse. They were out of the steak and eggs so I needed up going with Waygu burger- 27 dollars on the menu. Tolerable price for Waygu, although I'd argue the impossible burger at BK lounge is just as good as Harry's Waygu. It was a VERY chewy Waygu.

All in all, if we had a better waiter maybe would have been a better meal. I'll never be over the 30 dollar martini but the manager was a true professional and the bus boy saved the day on filling up the champagne.

Pic attached of the Waygu and the bun that looks like it was drenched in a port wine before hitting my burger.

2 stars only  because the manager took off the 30 dollar martinis and the bs OJ off the bill as a consolation.

Harry's has a bottomless brunch that you just can't beat ..... bottomless bubbles INCLUDED with an entree? Incredible! But Harry's advertises this deal nowhere, letting their marketing travel by word of mouth.

Disclaimer though: do not come here expecting a rowdy boozy brunch. If you want to listen to loud music and dance on the tabletops, take yourself somewhere else. You can tell even based on the the cozy dark interior and warm decor, that Harry's doesn't want that scene and neither do its other diners.

Now for the brunch itself... I strongly suggest ordering a juice for you and your crew for an extra couple bucks to help you down that champagne. My group of 8 ordered just two and that was perfect to add a splash of flavor to every glass. The champagne started out not all the bottomless and was a little slow, but then the food came and the continuous pours came with it. The food was great! I went with the eggs benedict because I can't see that on the menu and NOT order it. My meal was great, but the only negative was that my poach eggs were cooked through :(:( couldn't get that goooood fork-in-the-middle-tap-tap-yolk-runneth-over-onto-everything with a hard yolk.

Regardless of overdone poached eggs, I will definitely come back to Harry's. Probably with my family too. And for dinner. Brunch again. Yeah, I'll come back again and pay $28 for many glasses of champagne and eggs bennie.

I was in the city last week with two colleagues and we had dinner here on a Monday night, rather early. We had our choice of tables, and the service was outstanding from the start.

The old school ambiance was delightful and made even better when the service was also very old school. Our server recommended a number of appetizers and they were all outstanding - especially the tuna crudo.

Each of us enjoyed the evening's fish special - halibut on mushroom risotto with some sort of truffle reduction. It was nothing short of perfect. We had the green beans as a side dish and they were so fresh and a nice combination of warm yet still crisp.

There was no room for dessert after all of that terrific food, but I'll be back and will have dessert next time.

I am convinced there is not a better bottomless brunch in town. Upscale environment, really great vibes, good food, great service, bottomless CHAMPAGNE for 90 minutes, at a truly unbeatable price.

Just want to reemphasize that this is a bottomless CHAMPAGNE deal - what? Harry's is the answer to all my prayers and the internet memes of mimosas that are made with 99.9% champagne with a singular drop of orange juice.

I've been to a handful of ~$35 bottomless brunches around town, and I have never seen a deal like Harry's. You only pay for the price of your food. I had a delicious $18 breakfast sandwich, which came with bottomless champagne....unheard of in New York. The other dishes looked great as well, and the complementary breads were delicious as well.

It was really easy to make a reservation here. It was one of my friend's birthdays, and our party of 12 was able to get seated in a semi private area of the restaurant.

It's also a stone's throw away from Stone Street, so take advantage of your trek to FiDi!

Can't speak to the lunch and dinner menu, but I highly, highly, highly recommend for bottomless brunch.

Photo of Harry's - New York, NY, United States. Breakfast sandwich

Preface: I was taken here on a date, and my review is based on the service and the food as both were a disappointment.

Ambiance - This place has an amazing ambiance. It really was cozy, dimly lit, and embraced this gatsby-like vibe. The centerpiece in the main dining room is very eye-catching, and the decor in both the bar and the dining areas complimented very well.

Service - In general, it was very obvious that the management and the service staff were very inexperienced. The hostess kept apologizing trying to find our reservation when the dining room was only half full. When we were seated, our server was muttering the specials, and we really couldn't hear what he was saying. The serving technique itself from serving dishes to just refilling water was not smooth - the inexperience showed. The salmon tartare that we ordered was served tableside and mixed at the table. The server was clearly struggling with the two spoon mixing technique and it was really awkward.

Food - Probably the most disappointing factor here. None of the food was outstanding. I ordered the Filet medium rare. When I cut into it, it was charred so much on the outside and a medium at best on the inside. I asked to have it refired and it was taken away from my table. The manager proceeded to bring me back the overcooked steak and tell me that this was their standard of medium rare and they could refire one at rare if thats what I wanted. I have never experienced such pushback from management - and it was honestly insulting because it was so clearly not a medium rare.

Anyways - maybe would return for a drink, but wouldn't eat again here.

This has been one of my Dad's favorite restaurants for years. Went with my parents today for brunch, and I have to say it's the best brunch I've had in Manhattan (and I've had a lot!).

If you can get passed eating brunch in a dark-ish steakhouse-like  atmosphere, there was absolutely no wait on a Sunday morning, fantastic service and delicious food. Oh, and did I mention all you can drink champagne INCLUDED with entrees for 90 minutes? Take that Sarabeths, The Smith, (insert popular brunch destination here).

My brother and I ordered Steak and Eggs, and the portion was bigger than average, and everything on the plate was done perfectly. Both my parents got variations on Eggs Benedict and they were very happy. We also ordered coffee and dessert, everything was good. Highly recommended! I will definitely be back.

What a gorgeous gem! Absolutely amazing service and food to match. Dining solo? No problem. I sat in the bar area at a table with comfy club chairs. Cocktails totally on point Dinner INCREDIBLE.

I cannot say enough about how lovely this place is.

PS get Harry's Ice Cream Sunday
It is literal magic.

Came here for lunch with a large group. Food was very good. The soup, the appetizers the entrees all very good. We had lobster bisque, crab cake, onion rings, lobster, cocktail shrimp. Not one complaint. The steak was nice and tender came out perfect temperature. The salmon was not over cooked, the lobster fried rice done well. The deserts was all very good. The chocolate cookie with ice desert was top notch and def recommend. Atmosphere was good.

Only complain we had from our group of 25 was that the squid ink pasta was way to soft. The pasta broke the second the fork picked it up.

We all give this place a 4 star

I've been going to Harry's since it was an old man bar in 1992. I have a lot of respect for Harry and his restaurant empire.

This was first time having brunch there.the hostess sat us in a nice corner table. Our waiter was odd. He had hard time enunciating words and clearly communicating the sparkling wine with brunch arrangement. They basically give you a bottle with brunch - but they complicate that by instead just a continual 90 min pour. Problem with that is relying on service which was spotty.

The blood orange juice was a great accompaniment to the champagne. We ran our of juice so I decided to opt for white peach. They delivered yellow peach puree to the table. It tasted awful. I mentioned it to the hard to find waiter on my way back from the bathroom and he barely acknowledged it and said he'd send the manager. Shes comes over to argue with me that it is white peach (bright yellow/orange) in color because that's what the bottle says.

Anyway, they could have just offered to get me another blood orange but they insisted instead on arguing about it. No resolution, basically tough sh*t. Shockingly unprofessional. I left the drink the drink on the table and left the restaurant pretty irritated.

Not going back.

The original Harry came around and welcomed my private group of 30! The service was great. The private room was small and loud. The food was great. It's just legendary.

Well worth every single penny!

I know it's old school, but that's OK. (Actually makes it better, in fact.)

Easily the best bottomless brunch in all of NYC. (The Eggs Benedict are my hubby's favorite -- simply perfect every time. Me? I'm all about the salmon tartare. Sooooo good!)

(Speaking of bottomless, spring just a little extra for the Bellinis with brunch. OH MAH GAH.)

Simple but elegant ambience.
Consistently professional table service.

Just wonderful.

Fancy, upscale establishment that has no idea what grass-fed & finished is, nor organic. My dad used to eat here in the 80s with clients. Wish they would keep up with the times. Overpriced. Underwhelming.

The Summary:

Atmosphere - 3/5
Neighborhood - 3/5
Food - 3/5
Drinks - 5/5
Inclusivity - 3/5
Experience - 4/5

The Story:
Classy space with a fratty crowd. My biggest compliments here were the staff who were nice and attentive, and the bottomless brunch. The rate they keep the drinks going is where you get the bang for your buck.

I had an omelette, which came with toast and some potatoes. It was satisfying, but I could easily have found the same quality at a diner. I can't speak to the quality of the rest of the menu, but overall it was overpriced. Come here if you live in the neighborhood and want to experience the atmosphere with a group, otherwise I'm sure there are other options.

Wow - just had a fantastic meal here!!!

Let's start with the food. We started with a buffalo burrata, which the chef split for us without us even asking. It was delicious. So light and creamy. Then we shared the New York strip steak and potato purée. Cooked medium, the steak was flawless. The char on the outside was perfect and it was just fantastic. The potato purée was great as well. Then the cookies and cream for dessert is a cookie skillet with ice cream. SO GOOD!

Now the service is on a whole other level! We came by because we read on Eater that the restaurant just re-opened after undergoing over $1M in renovations. It looks gorgeous and the service was really above and beyond. Our waiter was amazingly hospitable and personable. I would return just because of the service but the food was fantastic as well so I will be back!

This is a great place close to my office. A little on the pricey side, but the food has always been consistently good, so I always go back. I've had plenty of different menu items. The burger is really good. So is the French dip sandwich, crab cakes and the steak is also done well. I'm a sucker for good French onion soup and it's delicious

Harry's is a must for brunch, especially if you live in the area! If you're looking for a bottomless drink deal in an upscale establishment with good food, service, and nice looking people then this is the place to be. Although we didn't opt for the unlimited champagne, we did have a couple of their delicious Bloody Marys. They start you off with complimentary breakfast breads & jam which were all yummy. We each had the steak & eggs - everything was cooked perfectly. We then split a slice of their lemon meringue pie to finish it all off.

Looking forward to coming back again for brunch or even dinner!

I am only giving it two stars because the shirley temple and hangover steak = delicious.

Bizarre occurrence when I went with my boss and other coworkers.  I wanted to order my steak without the asparagus or potatoes.  I asked the waiter if I could sub for fries.  He seemed hesitant.  I told him that I could just order fries separately.  However, he decided to ask me questions about why I wanted fries and not asparagus.  He said specifically, "So you don't like asparagus?" I replied that I did, but wanted fries today.  He kept on going about that asparagus. Then he said "so no potatoes either then?" ... I told him no. He looked frustrated.  He was getting louder and everyone at the table could hear.  I was embarrassed.  All of my coworkers were able to order without any additional questioning.

My boss broke the silence and said - "Wow! He was very aggressive!"  "Steak frites is not that hard..." Glad I wasn't the only one who thought that....

When my food came, guess what came with it? Asparagus. His explanation... "I forgot to put it into the computer that you didn't want it."  Don't believe that one bit.  Got a tiny thing of French fries.  Whole experience rubbed me the wrong way.

I don't understand what's so difficult about me wanting fries?!

Won't be back.

If you are looking for a place with good bottomless brunch, this is the place for you. Drinks are not premixed so you have the freedom to drink it how you prefer. The food was delicious. I had the steak and eggs. Steak was cooked to perfection. The rest of the people at my table also liked their food. Everyone enjoyed their time. Customer service was good. Price is not on the expensive side nor cheap. But for what you pay, you will get your money's worth.

Harrys is an old standby steakhouse in the financial district.  Good food, solid service, amazing wine program and great cocktails. Always warm and inviting.

Came here for dinner and the service was phenomenal. The food did take a while to come out but definitely was worth the wait. Our porterhouse was slightly under seasoned and more on the rare side but the meat was absolutely delicious and of high quality. Would definitely return here for that delicious lobster bisque!

A friend of mine recommended this place for Saturday brunch and man of man it was an amazing spot! She totally nailed it for picking the spot.

We were seated in a nice booth area, enough room for all 4 of us to enjoy eating and drinking. The bottomless champagne with our peach nectar juice was amazing.

We all pretty much ordered the same thing- steak and eggs but just different version of eggs. My eggs were scrambled with cheddar cheese. The plate came with delicious hash browns and toast. It was so much and it was soooooo good.

For dessert, we had the Creme brûlée which was just right! And the warm chocolate cake. I thought both were yummy.

I don't know how much champagne we had.... our waiter was very attentive, kept all our glasses filled... never letting it go empty.

The atmosphere was amazing! Service and food was delicious and I can't wait to come back for another brunch date!

Came here for a company holiday party and I've got to say their beef is pretty good. It's very tender but a little on the saltier side. I loved their mashed potatoes. It's not too thick and super creamy where you don't need gravy to give it any flavor. Not the best steakhouse but it is still pretty good. Would definitely come back to try some other dishes that they have

Came here for a girl's trip brunch, and from food to service it was a great experience. The atmosphere was high end and food was delish. Unlimited free champagne during brunch hours (with any entree purchase). All the girls left happy!
