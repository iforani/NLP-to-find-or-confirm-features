The food was great. No complaints at all. I enjoyed every bite of it. It was pretty empty and quiet for breakfast which I needed. You order your food they bring it to you and you dump your tray when your done. Can't wait till covid is over so they can have their full menu again.

It was drizzling out and I had to find outdoor seating for a group of 6 to unwind for late lunch. This place also just happened to be a 4 minute walk from where I live, but that was a happy coincidence.

What their operations look like right now is attached. 6-7 tables of people that can fit 6 people a little snugly but still comfortably. Order at the pick-up window, food and drinks. They yell out your name as you try to make sure you don't miss your food but also talk to your friends.

Kind of like how you used to fight over tables at Starbucks as a teenager in middle school to hang out with your crew? It's like that now but worse.

This place was even hopping on a Thursday early afternoon. At 3PM on a slightly just-finished-raining day, I was lucky I lived so close--most of the outside dining tables were taken. I guess not on a rainy day, though, the Park is right around the corner for a chill picnic.

BUT WHAT ABOUT THE WAFFLES ROSY?

Honestly, I got the salad with fried chicken. It's shreddin season, y'all. But I will say one of my friends was generous enough to let me half 1/8 of a waffle, and it was heaven. Maybe it was because I had just gone through some delicious lemony greens with juicy cherry tomatoes (it honestly was a great salad), but the fluffiness and slight sweet base of the waffle with the crisp edges and melty maple syrup was transcendent.

And then I proceeded to take a swig of maple syrup. Yeah, it's that damn good.

Pros:
Went to Sweet Chick last night to grab a quick bite. They have an outdoor section setup to order food and beverages. Food came out quickly! We had the fried chicken and waffles, which were delicious! The belgian waffle was moist and buttery. It literally melted in your mouth! The fried chicken was well seasoned and crunchy, delicious!  I've had their mac and cheese which I also love.

Cons:
The reason for 4 stars opposed to 5 was the seating. On previous visits during Covid-19, they had a few individual tables. Now they have about 5 or 6 picnic tables, with coverings- which is nice, but that seating is most beneficial to large groups. There were a lot of parties of two and everyone was hesitant to share a space because of social distancing.

I do understand that they're doing all they can to provide some from of a curbside dinning experience. As a consumer, I appreciate that and the respect and friendliness of the staff.

I first want to say thank you for the staff at Sweet Chick for being so accommodating and helping make this dinner so special with my dad. They let me put the tables together so he wouldn't have to be next to the open door and they let me sit until he arrived. You guys can't imagine how those small exceptions really meant a lot to my sister and I.

The food was awesome! The chicken was fried and seasoned just right. My waffle came with 3 variations of butter including this herb butter...delicious. The staff suggested this whisky lemonade combination...it was life in a cup!

The food and the experience were well worth the money. Thank you again Sweet Chick!

I didn't realize that this location was an order-at-the-counter type of restaurant with limited options but still enjoyed everything that I ordered.
Their chicken and waffles are unbelievable. The breading on the chicken is seasoned well and the hot sauce they provide is an excellent addition. The waffles are insanely good. I've never had better waffles-- so light and fluffy and not overly sweet but just enough. I love that they use real maple syrup unlike other places that give you the fake stuff.
Also ordered the Mac and cheese which was incredible as well-- very different tasting from any other Mac and cheese I've had. I guess they use a different blend of cheeses.

Will definitely be back for more! I just wish they had other waffle options like in the other locations

Pro tip- order the leg and the thigh with the chicken and waffles over the 4 piece tenders. My friend regretted her decision and ate some of mine instead.

The have tables and benches and although they don't require reservations it's good to know ppl have the common courtesy to eat and then dip.
The food is made fresh to order so it takes a min but this was definitely worth the wait. The waffles fries were the TRUTH and the chicken with the syrup .. to die for.
Worth checking out!!

I love Sweet Chick, its been my go to for out of towners for years. Its bold soul food menu at a fair price. It was my first time in the Brooklyn location. They been doing a great job during Quarantine - they have benches all over to sit, a simplified menu, music flaring. The atmosphere is great.
Heres are my areas of opportunities: the music was literally so loud. I'm shouting back and forth about my order. And it's literally happening with everyone around me. It also makes it challenging hearing when your order is called. The strength of the drinks I find questionable. Lastly the benches could end up being monopolized but that's not the restaurant's fault.

After riding in the "Bike ride for Black Lives" event, we decided " let's go to Brooklyn to eat". Little did I realize we would be riding/ and some walking across the Brooklyn Bridge to get there. I kept telling myself it will be worth it. Oh and the uphill ride on Flatbush Avenue to the restaurant- again worth it. A bIke rack was right in front of the outdoor seating made it perfect for us.

We ordered the shrimp and grits, a Nashville hot chicken sandwich, Jalapeño cheese hush puppies ,  frozen piña collado, frozen Rosé. We were starving but the food was delicious. The drinks were thoroughly refreshing with a little kick.

Did I say, "It's worth the trip" and we will be going back, by car.

To preface this review, I've frequented the Williamsburg location many times. However, I was not a fan of the food at "Lil Sweet Chick." Conceptually, it makes a lot of sense given the covid world we're living in.

I ordered the Nashville hot chicken sandwich with a side of Mac and cheese. I was shocked when I received my food. I felt so cheated --- I spent $17 on the smallest portion sizes ever. Granted the food was tasty, but definitely not worth $17! I was also a little skeptical of the cook on my chicken. As I bit into it, I noticed my chicken was on the light pink side. It hadn't been fully cooked through.

If I do return, it'll probably only be for the full menu items, not the little school lunch joints they put together lol!

Lil Sweet Chick seemed like a really great idea, so I was hyped to try it. Got delivery and it was still reasonably fresh, so I got to taste things pretty close to peak. (Shoutout to Uber Eats!)
The sandwich and fries ($15) looked gorgeous. We even had a photo shoot moment. And the cheddar jalapeño hush puppies ($10.... yes. TEN WHOLE AMERICAN DOLLARS) looked promising. I tucked into the hush puppies first as I know those go south not long after they cool.
Let me also say- I'm from NC, where these delicious little things are usually like $1.50 for a dozen, or free. So my expectations were priced accordingly.
Anyways. Bit in. Meh. It was a standard hush puppy. Kinda grainy and dry. Needed honey butter. Didn't taste any of the cheddar or jalapeño? Had my BF try one, she agreed. Later on I got to one where the cheese was finally found. Jalapeño was nowhere though- the green bits I think were scallion? Tried it with the provided remoulade style sauce, it was good, but I had some honey butter in the fridge that I used instead. Definitely not worth ten dollars. (And there were like 5 per order, to add insult to injury here.)
The sandwich was tasty, albeit spicy-ish considering there is a spicy option on the menu and I didn't get that. About the same level of spice as CFA's spicy sandwich. (Actually. It really reminded me of that.) The chicken portion itself was an even thickness and fried really well- very crispy and not oily- it actually made me think of how good their chicken n'waffles must be, with that buttery waffle and sweet syrup! Soft potato bun, a bounty of sweet pickle chips and an herb mayo rounded out their OG chicken sandwich. Their waffle fries felt super familiar, kind of soft and only crispy around the edges- paired very well with ketchup. Overall not bad, but as others have pointed out, significantly smaller portions and much bigger price tag than I would have paid *clears throat* at comparable establishments. Also their $2.50 beverages are cans.
So Lil Sweet Chick may not have been *just* what I was looking for tonight, but I'm still looking forward to going to the restaurant and trying their chicken and waffles!

Was walking through the area, was hungry, and did not want to wait until I got home, so to lil' sweet chick I went. First time coming to this location, and I had not been before they rebranded to lil' sweet chick. I only have memories from the Williamsburg location, and I did not enjoy that experience. But I don't think you can go wrong with chicken sandwiches.

The cashier wasn't very friendly. He looked pretty over it, but I tipped him well and kept it moving. I got the nashville hot chicken sandwich and a frosé. Luckily the outdoor seating was pretty open (although one of the vacant tables had a paper bag on it and hot sauce spilled all over it--they don't seem to have anyone monitoring cleanliness after people leave), so I decided to sit and eat. The drink was good, nothing to rave about.The sandwich came out pretty fast, and it was hot (temp wise and spice-wise)...but the size was not worth $10. It's tiny. Good, but a snack, really. I think $6, maybe even $7 would be more appropriate pricing for it. I like spicy food, and the pickles helped a little, but it definitely could have used some sauce to cut the taste--so I would order one of those on the side should I decide to return.

The thing that bothered me the most though, is that they're not enforcing mask use for customers or social distancing. A couple people came up to the window with either no mask, or their mask pulled down under their chin when they ordered. Then one of the mask-less people decided to sit directly opposite of me while waiting for their order when there was a ton of space on the other side of the table. Social distancing and mask-usage requirements should be announced when people come to the window.

*There is also some sort of picnic basket menu item for around $40 that includes a couple of sandwiches and I believe 3 sides. That seems worth it for the price.

PURCHASED: Fried Chicken and Waffles ($19) + Biscuit, sausage with gravy ($7)
TOTAL: $26

PROS
+ Come hungry, leave full: The chicken and waffles was probably enough food. I shouldn't have ordered the side. (Note, I eat alot. Like I have 2 dinners on some evenings).

+ Vegetarian Chicken & Waffles: I had a bite of the 'fake' chicken (please see photo) and it tasted delicious. To describe it: It taste like a different type of meat. It's good. (Of note, I am a meat eater).

CONS:
- Pricey: It's a bit pricey. I mean $19 for some fried batter and fried chicken? Chicken is the cheapest meat when compared to beef, pork et cetera. Why so pricey?

- Loud: The restaurant is loud on a Sunday morning. Maybe not ideal for trying to catch up with friends or after a night of drinking. But, they are bumping some dope tracks (e.g., Beyonce, A Tribe Called Quest, R&B jams, et cetera).

- Long wait: We were told 45 minutes was the estimate time and that it could be longer. We waited for approximately 1 hour and 20 minutes before being rung to be seated.

IMPRESSION:
Went for Sunday brunch in early March 2020. Lot's of great things about the place. Though, the dining experience can be improved.

If someone else made another chicken and waffles joint, I am sure they would drive down the price for the dish here. (It would be a great business opportunity for others looking to do business.) The price here is expensive! Though, it did fill you up.

Great food! Cool vibe!

The missus and I walked around over to Sweet Chick for breakfast and enjoyed every bit of it. Usually on the weekend there's a nice wait for breakfast. We were told 35-40 minutes for a table for two. So we walked across the street to DNY Natural Land to do a little shopping. Five minutes later the hostess texted me that our table was ready.

We were seated by the window on this sunny day and had a great view of Flatbush Ave.  My wife had the chicken & waffles and I ordered the shrimp & grits with a side of maple glazed bacon. The service was great. Even though they were packed, we weren't rushed at all. Our server checked on us frequently and brought us more water.

This was a great start to a lazy weekend.

OMGosh!!! BOMB!!!

I actually ended up here on a whim. My friends and I were heading across Brooklyn to some other spot after an event we'd all been to. I spotted Sweet Chick as I was driving by and asked everybody if they'd rather stop in here instead.

We called to ask about the wait time (as we were sitting in the car 1/2 a block away) they said it's about a 30 minute wait. After the call, we decided to head inside and would you believe we were seated right away?

Idk why but I was actually quite excited when we sat down, I think I had this place bookmarked for a while but I hadn't gotten around to visiting. The drink menu was VERY inviting, I went with the "Queen of New York" a friend had the "Christopher Wallace", another the " Sweet Chick" and the last one had a lemonade (she'd had enough to drink for the evening by that point lol).

For dinner we all had chicken (big surprise lol) in some form. I chose the chicken bucket with a side of mash potatoes and an additional side of greens. The bucket came with a biscuit as well. My friends all had different versions of chicken and waffles, with one getting a side of the creamiest mac and cheese. I tried a piece of a bacon and cheese waffle. Everything was GREAT!

The space is cute, there's outdoor seating during the warmer months. The neighborhood is cute. Definitely going back!

This fried chicken is EXCELLENT and every side I've tried has been delicious as well! It's a bit pricey, and I find I have to order far in advance because they're so popular that the wait is quite long. But most of the time, when I'm not it a rush and I want to splurge, it is worth it.

The folks behind the counter are super friendly as well.

All the thumbs are up for Sweet Chick on Flatbush.

Love this spot! It has a fun ambiance and great food. I get the chicken and waffles here and the chicken is fried deliciously with the sweet complement of the syrupy waffle on the side. I've also had the shrimp and grits here which are very tasty.

They've also got great drinks, especially a good Bloody Mary for a Sunday morning. I definitely am overdue to come back here!

This is what I found in my waffle fries . A rubber band. Although I enjoyed the rest of my order (Classic Chicken & waffles) this was very disappointing and dissatisfying to come upon. This is amidst Covid. The establishment should be on their P's and Q's regarding staying sanitary. Extremely disappointed.

Sweet chick was fun! It is a main attraction in the area and is very small so you'll have to come in and grab a seat before rush hour or way later (unless in the summer where outdoor dining is available, more space). Food was good and chicken was seasoned and cooked to perfection but a little dry. The table syrup and hot sauce helped! Staff was very attentive and seemed to come around right when I needed something. I had a solo date but hardly felt alone with the music and interaction, it was a very pleasant experience.

To say this was a shitty restaurant is an understatement...

I'll begin with their outdoor seating. There was no indication, sign, employee, or anything that explained to customers that you are to order food at their window and pick a seat if you can find one. So my friend and I had to guess the protocol. That was the first of many shitty things.

Secondly, the food was mediocre at best. With such tiny portioned food, why the hell was it still priced the same? I had a shriveled up wing and what looked to be a third of a chicken breast with my waffles, oh and let's not forget the one small sized cup of syrup they gave me for my waffles which I will say, were tasty. But that and the Mac and cheese were the only good thing about this place.

The drinks! This location ought to be ashamed of themselves. My friend and I ordered boozy lemonade and iced tea. There was 0 alcohol in our $13 drinks. Like none at all. The guy at the front insisted he put alcohol in it and I'll admit my friend said she saw him pour the alcohol in it, however I'm convinced there was water in that bottle that he was pouring from. We were not buzzed, tipsy, or nice.

Overall, I will not being going here again. They're wack af and it's not worth it. Instead I recommend Tacombi which isn't far from Sweet Chick.

I've now been to every Sweet Chick location in NYC, and if you aren't tired of my other reviews from the other location, I got another for you here.

This particular location is in what I consider the heart of Brooklyn. The vibes are all what Brooklyn is like, up the block from the Barclays center. I might just start coming here for the literal location itself. Our waiter was really sweet and always attentive. I wish I got her name! But let's jump into food talk..

This place just knows what they are doing. Their drinks are creative, I couldn't even tell you what was in them but it was GOOD. The Mac and cheese just might be one of the best around. And their chicken and waffles? The chicken is juicy to the bone, they give you dark meat which we KNOW has more juice to it. The waffles I had this time were apple cinnamon and it was like I was eating a apple cider donut. Perfect balance for the chicken and Mike's hot. Sweet Chick remains one of my go-to's in this city.

Delish chicken and brunch-type digs at any time of day (including an in-between menu from 4-6 PM). I've been here and the location in Williamsburg and this one beats it in terms of overall space and ambiance. Great waffles as always!

I find getting one dish at any given Sweet Chick is typically enough to make most people full. Do this to avoid the inevitable sugar crash after and maybe have a cup of tea or coffee. Some stuff is a bit over-hyped but it's a bunch place, so you have little say in the matter in what really is "over-hyped".

The Hot Honey special is one of my favorite chicken and waffle dishes, and the mac is definitely worth trying. Be wary as things are very much on the pricier side here! Nas ain't playing.

One word...BRUNCH!!!!

I landed in New York and this was the first place I came too. My cousin is a native New Yorker and said she wanted to take me to a place that was very New York needless to say this was not disappointing.

Everyone was very nice and helpful when it came to the menu and anything NewYork and since I was visiting this was very helpful to me.

Luckily we sat at the bar because as we got there a couple was leaving, other wise it was an hour and a half wait time to be seated. Side note: it would have been worth the wait.

I ordered the chicken and waffles and let me tell ya they were delicious and came with three different types of butter...THREE!!!! From the pictures it may not look like a lot of food, but trust me it's plenty.

If you are in NY and want a good brunch experience this is the place to be!

Tasty chicken if you don't mind eating from a Petri dish. The guy working the register was not covering his face, even as some customers wore no mask while ordering at a very close distance. The customers were not asked to wear masks either - that is state law right now. I witnessed this as I waited 25 minutes for an order that I then found out was lost; needless to say I cancelled it and left.

This is my first time going to Sweet Chick during the day. The night crew has always been professional and clean, but these Saturday lunch folks were a disaster. I've been a regular customer since they opened, but I won't be back; this is why BK covid is out of control.

Sweet Chick is BACK as Lil' Sweet Chick and I couldn't be happier. Their to-go window includes sandwiches, a couple chicken and waffle options, fried chicken, and sides - including their Mac n cheese, which is out of this world good. I recently ordered the Nashville hot chicken sandwich ($10) and it was amazing. They are also offering a picnic special, which includes either two chicken sandwiches or four pieces of fried chicken + three sides for $40. Great deal for an outing to Prospect Park.

Highlight: chicken and waffles

I came here for brunch with my 2 friends on a weekday in the summer. We were seated immediately and greeted by the waiter.

I ordered a boozy lemonade ($13) w/ burbon and it was quite refreshing. I also ordered the chicken waffle sandwich with fries. The waffle was soft and sweet. The chicken was crunchy and flavorful. I think the sauce it was tossed in was bbq.

My friends both ordered the classic chicken and waffle and they asked for DARK MEAT so that it was more juicy. Also be sure to ask for their special butter (its free).

Overall I was extremely satisfied with my meal. Only con I have is that it was kinda of humid because the AC was not on and they have an open patio design.

Ordered takeout through Yelp and this was legit the best dinner I've had in months. Fried chicken was the perfect texture, moist and tender, with just the smallest hint of spice. Waffle was excellent; the seasoned butters were surprising and good. My daughter and I agree the mac & cheese was good enough we'd go back just for that. Order was ready at the early end of the twenty-minute pickup window and 100% accurate. We'll definitely be repeating this experience.

This was soooo good.

By the time we arrived, Sweet Chicks was on their condensed menu which is served from 3-6 pm. We had four options to choose from: Mac and cheese, a BLT salad, shrimp and grits, and chicken and waffles. The shrimp andgrits's were served with cheddar grits and a runny egg . The chicken and waffles came with two pieces of fried chicken breast and four thick slices of infused waffles. Waffle choices were classic, dried cherry, apple and cinnamon, spiced pecan, and rosemary and mushroom, and bacon and cheddar. They were served with four different types of butter: lemon, berry, classic, and herbs. For $2 extra you could order mike's hot honey on the side.

I ordered the chicken and bacon and cheddar waffles with rosemary herb butter. It came out quick and hot with powdered sugar dusted over it. I drenched it in their complimentary hot sauce which had more of a vinegary spice to it than any real heat. But I wish I had a travel
size of it to take it with me. I felt like my meal was missing something until I added it. Everyone at my table ordered their own version of chicken and waffles and we all really enjoyed it.

They also serve vegan chicken here made from seitan. I tried this as well and thought it was pretty good.

Great atmosphere and friendly service. The Flatbush location is right across the subway station so very convenient. Unfortunately I was too full to try the chicken but from the menu it looks like there are plenty of chicken and waffle iterations (definitely on my list to come and have these).
Instead I got a side chick (mildly spicy yummy drink) and a pistachio pie--I know right??? Id never had or heard of this before but it was Delicious!! Lovely subtle pistachio layer with whipped cream and a delightfully crumbly crust. Just yum!

Ok let's start with the bad because ....it was pretty bad. That bbq has was so just ....not good. I mean u can look att the picture and see it does not look appetizing at least to me. I tasted no bbq for one and there was a sour curry like taste. I hate sending food back and will normally justt but eAt what I ordered But guys this was so bad that I HAD to ! I could not eat it :(. Idk what the issue was but the server asked if I wanted something else and as guilty as I felt I said yess. I'm glad I did tho because the meal wasn't cheap ($15 I  think) and the chicken and waffles were AWESOME! that's why I was conflicted I didn't know if I should give them 4 or 3 stars.

The hash is most def a 1 star. But wveryting else was 4/5!!

Since they redeemed themselves with everything else I went ahead and gave 5 stars.

Now for the good!!...the biscuits omg the biscuits were sooo bomb!! I also got a smothered biscuit I think i t was and aLso th best thing I've had in a while. Best smothered biscuits ive had hands down. As well as the butters they were so goood I should've just eaten those for my meal! Hahah

The chicken and waffles was also good. Very filling and not greasy.

The spiked lemonades were awesome !! Wish it wasn't so busy all the time on the weekends or I i would def get my Sunday tipsy on there when I am off--which isn't very often . . So the fact they have weekDAY brunch and drink specials is amazing ! So happy because not everyone can make brunch on the weekend (like myself ) some of us  have to work and want to brunch on the weekday ! Well they have something for us.

Couldn't give a full 5 stars because of that hash. I am not sure if I just got it on a bad day but. The description just doesn't even reflect the presentation nor the flavor

Had a nice meal here. It can get loud but it has a fun vibe with music playing. We were told there was a wait but people had not been coming back so a 30-40 minute wait ended up being only 5 minutes. We had the chicken and waffles as well as the vegetable bbq has with pulled pork and split Mac and cheese. The hash was delicious. It had a ton of every aspect. Lots of baby potatoes, veggies (peppers, peas, onions), and a lot of pork. My only complaint might be a little too much bbq sauce. The Mac and cheese was VERY good. I don't think it needs the ritz crumble on top. In my opinion, it takes away a little bit because it tastes artificial and the Mac and cheese itself tastes very authentic. Look forward to coming back.

First time here my friends for dinner. They do not take reservations so the wait is usually pretty long, but we only waited 30 minutes. Once you give your name and number they will text you when a table is available.

I ordered the chicken sliders, Mac and cheese along with the strawberry salad. My friends had the chicken and waffles. The food was delicious and tasty. The service was prompt and friendly. Our waiter was attentive to our needs.

Overall, it's a great spot for brunch, lunch or dinner.

When I went to Barclay's for a graduation, I couldn't help but think of what to eat afterwards. Thank god Sweet Chick is only a couple blocks away. Came here with a party of four and we all decided to get the chicken and waffles.

Waffles come in various flavors, I decided to get the cheddar and bacon. It was delicious, the cheddar and bacon flavor isn't overpowering but you know its their. It went perfectly well with the fried chicken. Wish the chicken pieces were bigger but I can't complain, they were clean cuts and were fried to perfection.

I also had their lemonade, it was refreshing. Very hard to find good lemonade that isn't over sugared, this was just that. Great place to come as a group and the outdoor seating is convenient for the hot summer days.

I tried sweet chick for the first time when they opened their location in the city, I thought it was fine but nothing that really stood out. My opinion definitely changed this time around.

I came on a Tuesday for an early dinner a few minutes right before 5. They have an "in between" menu from 4-6 p.m. The prices are the same it's just limited in selection. You can get two pieces of fried chicken and a choice of waffle. They don't offer the specialty ones like buffalo until dinner time. You can also get the Mac n cheese, shrimp and grits, and BLT salad.

I got the rosemary and mushroom waffle, and shared the Mac n cheese with my friend. Loved the Mac n cheese, definitely rich and cheesy enough. The waffle was hot, crunch on the outside and soft on the inside, tasted great with maple syrup. Chicken was fried well.

Tables were sticky though... but food was good.

It's so funny what often draws people into trying someplace new. I have walked past Sweet Chick without ever flinching or really inquiring about their story until I heard that it was celebrity-backed.

I met with a friend at 4:30pm. Sweet Chick had a limited menu appropriately titled, "In-Between Brunch + Dinner" for patrons dining between 4-6pm daily. Great idea!

I had to order their popular dish, chicken and waffles. I never knew there were so many different types of waffles. Where have I been? I mean classic, bacon + cheddar, dried cherry, rosemary + mushroom, spiced pecan, and apple cinnamon. Huh? How am I supposed to choose? I weighed the pros and cons between spiced pecan and apple cinnamon, which won lol. If that was not enough, we were provided with three different types of butter. No clue what they were and I didn't bother asking, because I wanted my taste buds to do all of the talking. I liked the strawberry as well as the apple cinnamon butter. I was not a fan of the chive butter.

The ambiance was great, especially since we skipped ahead of the dinner crowd. The decor just set the perfect tone - relaxed and at home. Now that's the Brooklyn vibe!

Sweet Chick is conveniently located downtown Brooklyn, a few blocks from the Barclay & surrounded by other bars & lounges if you're wanting to do something after or before. All the locations are small & this one is no different. They do close at 2am, which is pretty cool if your looking for cooked food & not wanting fast food.

My friends & arrived after 12am & was told it would be a 30min wait, but luckily we only waited about 15mins. The menu prices are decent, but I felt some things were a little overpriced. For a beverage I had the "Love Below" which was decent & one of my friends had the "Sweet Chick" she thought it was ok & my other friend had lemonade with Tito's & said it was pretty light. For dinner I had the shrimp & grits & it had a poached egg on top & my friends got chicken & waffles. Now I'm picky when it comes to grits & it has to have cheese & be a certain way. I thought the food was ehh. My friends said their chicken & waffles was ok, but the syrup seemed funny. It didn't taste like maple syrup, although the waitress said it was. The syrup to me had like a coffee after taste...I don't know about that. I also tried their "Queen of NY" drink which was a interesting combination. It was courvoisier with rośe & smashed strawberries at the bottom with some other mixer. It was good..but interesting.

Overall the service was fine, but the food was just ok. This wouldn't be a restaurant at the top of my list.

Was in town and my friends were raving about this place that rapper, Nas owns. It's a chicken and waffles spot in different varieties. I'm not a big chicken and waffles fan so I was hoping they would have chicken sandwiches but they only had the sliders. They were so good though! The bread was so soft and the chicken was so juicy!

Came to Sweet Chick after watching my Brooklyn Nets defeat the New York Knicks. I've been to the Williamsburg location, but the Flatbush location is a vibe too. I ordered the shrimp and grits, which had a tomato base and lots of flavor. The gravy is plentiful, so you taste it in every bite. The plate was topped with a poached egg, which I feel could be a littttle softer. There was lots of shrimp and it was good for the $26 price tag. The drink is called Numb Numb Juice, and it's made with Couvosier and hibiscus tea.
