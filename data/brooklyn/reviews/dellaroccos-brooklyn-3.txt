An ideal day: Dellarocco's pizza, an aperol spritz, and outdoor dining.

The pizza is so good but the crust is next level, as everyone else has mentioned on here. Fluffy, airy, and slightly charred from the oven. The pizzas aren't huge but you could definitely split one with another person. Or, just go for it and make it your own personal pizza. They have gluten free and vegan options as well.

They've for sure followed all of the social distancing rules which I appreciated, so no one was seated right next to other tables. Will definitely be coming back here or ordering takeout! I have my eye on the pizza with truffle oil and the red sauce with pancetta and leeks.

We've come here before covid and loved the pizza and service, and now it is our takeout choice for good artisinal pizza. I usually don't care for pizza crust, but I absolutely love Dellarocco's. It's not always a given with delivery, but our pizza arrived warm and ready to eat (not cold and sad).
We ordered 2 pizzas -
Quattro Gusti - includes 4 different types of pizzas - Margherita STG, Arrabbiata, Zucchini, and Dellarocco. The Arrabbiata (tomato, mozzarella, hot soppressato, spicy EVO) was by far our favorite and we'll probably order an entire pie next time.
Monalizza (white pizza) - N'duja calabrese, ricotta, sweet orange tomatoes, mozzarella, Mike's hot honey - also our favorite. the tomatoes were a juicy compliment to the ricotta and hot honey (not too spicy)
Definitely recommend and we will definitely be ordering again, but can't wait to be able to come back for in-person dining!

I can't believe I'd never even heard of this place until the time of covid. My hubby and I decided to check this place out because it's on a quiet street and they have outdoor seating. The atmosphere and service were great ... not to mention - really good pizza !! I don't think I have one negative thing to say about my experience here - we'll be back : )

Their pizza: 4.5/5
Speed: 0/5

We went on a Saturday around 2pm and sat outside, there was maybe 1 or 2 other patrons in the restaurant at the time. We waited for approx 20min for our 1 pizza!

The pizza itself was delicious, crunchy and pillowy crust which is how I judge my pizzas. But I would never go back and go for a sit down experience again. May have to try takeout but I would expect a wait as well

Absolutely stellar pizza, with a crust you'll dream about after eating. They are small affairs; personal pies, really, but astounding in quality and absolutely worth the price. The quality of the ingredients is evident in every bite, and amplified by an attitude of craftsmanship that turns a piece of flat bread into a work of art.

If you don't know where to start, try the namesake Dellarocco. The traditional interplay of broccoli rabe, sausage, and peppers showcase everything great food should be: a callout to tradition with a steadfast resolve to keep things fresh and accessible.

The narrative here is quality, not quantity, and the recitations hew closely to that story.

So yummy! We ordered two pizzas for delivery and it came on time and was still pretty warm. We had the Brigante and Arrabbiata, which were both delicious. I believe they have heaters right now for outdoor seating, too.

My husband discovered this place from following the Vegan New Yorker in Instagram.
They use a new vegan cheese the mimics fresh mozzarella called NUMU.
Listen when I tell you this place has got a good vegan pie.
As soon as you enter you're overwhelmed with delicious smells of garlic and fresh baked dough.
We also loved the marinara sauce which is very fresh and bright.
They can customize any pizza on the menu to make vegan and they also had a few vegan options listed.
The dining space is open and comfortable, not crowded or stuffy.
The service was very good as well.
The kids liked that you could see the brick oven with the "kitchen" open to the dinning room.
Very Highly Recommended.

Dellarocco's Brick Oven Pizza is an outstanding neighborhood pizza joint.  The food is reasonably priced, the service is solid, and the pizza is delicious!

This pizza place let's the quality of it's ingredients speak for themselves.  While the pie's are light on cheese, they're incredibly flavorful.  The crust has the perfect amount of crunch, the dough is light and airy, and there's a wide variety of topping to choose from!

Strongly recommend.  P.S. make sure to grab an ice-cold Peroni on tap!

Dellarocco's is a great neighborhood place for pizza. I've dined in and ordered takeout, and would recommend the former. The storefront is located on Hicks Street, off the hustle and bustle from Montague. The space is quite lovely, with large windows and bright white walls.

The wood-fired Neopolitan-style pizzas at Dellarocco's have a light and airy crust, though the thinness often means the center of the pizza gets a little wilted (which is why I recommend dining in over takeout). To combat this problem, I would suggest keeping to the white pizzas as the addition of tomato sauce adds to the heaviness/sogginess of the delicate crust. Some pies I would recommend include the Dellarocco ($18) with smoked mozzarella, broccoli rabe, Italian sausage and garlic or the Tartufata ($21) with truffle cream, shiitake mushrooms, mozzarella, and speck.

Sooooo I came here on a Thursday night with a good friend of mine and this place was packed! It was my first time visiting but definitely not my last. I loved the decor a bit of a rustic feel on the inside. There's a bar area with stools you can sit and grab a glass of wine and chill.

There's also two main rooms where they sit people with one of the rooms a bit tucked away to the side seemed more intimate to me.

My friend and I started off with an appetizer with different cheeses, grapes and slices of bread with jam. The sweet and salt taste was so amazing and the different type of cheese was a good starter.

For our pizza we had the Quattro Gusti (four selections) so we both had the opportunity to sample four different styles of pizza! Definitely didn't disappoint with their oven style!

The atmosphere is very relaxed even though they were packed and they had customers waiting we didn't feel rushed to leave.

So I landed at JFK and the first thing on my mind was PIZZA! New Yorkers love their pizza and so do J but there is one huge problem, I'm allergic to gluten. So pizza for me typically tastes like someone melted cheese on the cardboard box the pizza comes in...well not at Dellarocco's!

Their gluten-free pizza was so soft, tender, and airy...what a treat. I ordered the meatball pie and I ate it all...it was phenomenal. The only downside I would say is that it wasn't too flavorful but other than that it was cooked to perfection.

I definitely will eat there again.

Heard a lot about the place.
Ordered a pizza with extra toppings - out of 5 toppings ordered 2 were not present at all, literally - not a single piece. Half of the pizza missing cheese altogether. The crust on another side half-baked, like chewing gum. Utter disappointment, absolutely worst NYC pizza I ever had.

Photo of Dellarocco's - Brooklyn, NY, United States

Dellaroco's is conveniently located in Brooklyn Heights with many train and bus lines nearby. The place looks beautiful, it is spacious and even has a bar area. I like that they offer 3 vegan options for pies along with their vast dairy options. I ordered one of the vegan pies, can't remember the name, but it was the one with brussels sprouts. The pie used Numu cheese which is usually very good at other places, here it seems the cheese did not melt well. I also found that pie was still doughy and had not firmed up in the oven. My friend who ordered a regular also did not enjoy her pie.

Wow wow wow I'm so impressed. My SO and I came here for a Monday night date night - we typically never pick Italian because of the lack of vegan options. We decided to look at the menu any way because it is a long time neighborhood favorite and we love pizza. While I was just expecting a red pie with veggie toppings, Dellaroccos recently added a small vegan menu that has VEGAN CHEESE and carefully selected toppings. It would be an understatement to say I was excited

We ordered the grilled veggie appetizer that was so much more than slices of veggies, they made a beautiful presentation of eggplant, peppers, and zucchini. The flavor was unbelievable !

I had the Lei pizza which was a burst of flavor in every bite. I was beyond impressed with the flavor - it wasn't just an every day "oh here are your toppings on dough" they were tastefully pulled together. Definitely returning!

Absolutely horrible. See pictures.  Here we are trying to support local businesses by ordering food and after spending over 40 dollars for a personal pizza and a kale salad, this is what they send over? Paid for EXTRA meatballs...do you see ANY , let alone extra. Looks like it was swallowed and regurgitated by an alligator. Disgusting.  Dry and dead kale leaves is what they are presenting as  a kale Caesar salad.  Spend my 40 dollars well. The food is in the  trash.  THANK YOU!  Wish you continued success

Dellarocco's has the best pizza!!! We came here often before Covid and the service was always good. My bf loves this place but we were all stuck inside during quarantine so for his birthday I surprised him with a Dellarocco's pizza delivered to his apartment. Angie was super helpful in making sure the pizza box was decorated with the words Happy Birthday! It was decorated really pretty and my bf loved it!! See the photo. You can tell they cared and wanted to make it nice. I definitely recommend!

Such a great find in Brooklyn! There is tons of good pizza spots in bk but this one should be listed in tops pizza spots. It's delicious thin crusted pizza that makes you want more with every bite.
My brother and I took my cousin visiting from England (in the picture, lol) and they both went back again the next day.
The staff is also very friendly.

Wood Fired Brick Oven Pizza Restaurant in Brooklyn is such a great nook. I loved the Eggplant it was very tasty. After going to Italy 2 times a year for 7 years I'm picky about the way the sauce taste. Call me crazy but once you have pasta or any Italian food in Italy .these Italian restaurants in NY have a picky one on their hands... LOL. But this place gets it very close....
With my Eggplant plant dish I had a glass of Montepulciano which was at the right temperature to taste..

Montepulciano, one of Italy's most popular red wine grapes, has thrived in Abruzzo- region of east-central Italy, since the middle of the 18th century. A plump grape, which gives good yields of easy-drinking wine, it is popular with producers and consumers alike. The variety typically provides deeply colored juice ,which varies from ruby to purple depending on vintage and the particular winemaking techniques used, with low acidity and soft, unobtrusive tannins.

YUMMMMY!!!

I don't know what's going on here with this crust, maybe I am just not sophisticated enough to understand this pizza. I was on my way to Carroll Gardens when it started to rain, so I decided to look for "best Bklyn pizza nearby". This came up, and the pies looked promising, but...Listen I know everything is not L&B, most of the pies in NYC are thin Neapolitan, but I just don't expect to fold my slice and pick it up and it flops down like I'm trying to hold melted cheese in my hand. I guess that's the reason for the knife and fork, but the paper thin slice didn't even seem done all the way through. I am not eating a crepe, I expect a little architecture to the crust, something to give it a base. Am I wrong here?

And if we're being all sophisto and white napkin in this place, then shouldn't you be able to explain the food to me a little bit? Isn't that the characteristic of new foodie Bklyn restaurants, that they tell you every little thing about the food you're eating, both on the menu and in person? The sausage was so good, but the staff had no clue. You know, what kind, where's it from, is it local, made in house, is there someplace I can buy it, what! Pepperoni, same. Cannoli, same. Is it from a bakery around here, hello? They just seemed to be phoning it in, waiter-wise. And btw, the cannoli? Meh, too much sweet ratio, if I wanted to eat an entire bag of powdered sugar I would do so.

I would say that I really don't care about waitstaff, the focus is the food, and the crust is not up to the standard of classic pizza in my humble view. I think maybe it was cooked wrong, the outer crust was perfect, chewy, little burnt spots, smoky taste, the cheese great and fresh, the porcini mushrooms, so good, the other slices of kale and sausage, how creative and a great mix, but...crust, the rebar of the pie, if you will, the inner part has got to be firm enough to at least carry a basil leaf without collapsing. But what do I know. Anyway, yeah, Carroll Gardens next time.

Best meal I have had while on my vacation to NYC. They had a great menu & even vegan cheese for anyone who is looking for a dairy free option. Along with the great food, every member of the staff was welcoming & sweet which made it an even better evening.

The photos of pizza were amazing... but I guess you can't eat the cover of a book.

We ordered delivery last night and ordered a specialty pizza with toppings and a meatball app. The meatballs and sauce tasted great. A little too bready though.

Our $30 pizza was disappointing:(

Dough was chewy and without substance. The pizza couldn't take the little toppings and cheese it came with
- ordered extra toppings.  Maybe they added them, I couldn't tell.
I am sure the ingredients are primo, are they worth $5 each for a small personal 12 inch? NOPE

$45 total

We pass this place many times and think its a cute, family oriented restaurant. Overpriced, overrated and I am over them.

Pros:
Great pizza flavor
Super moist meatballs
Nice atmosphere
Clean

Cons:
No official bartender led to a bad cocktail and improperly poured wine spritzer
Crust wasn't crispy so droopy pizza
One server meant needing to call him over for drinks more water and then the check
Also not the biggest thing but bread to start is nice in an Italian restaurant.
