YES. The pasta is cooked al dente, sauce is just right, not too creamy and not too watery. Shrimp is fresh, plump and firm. We ordered take-out since they don't have outdoor seating and the pasta was still good when we brought it back home, albeit we only live 5 min walk away. The calamari was fresh and it's served with some zucchini as well. Big portions! We also got the nutella fried pizza dough dessert, which was delish. I'm sure it would've been even better if we ate it dining in. Will definitely try their pizza soon!
Delicious food. I walked to this place to only find out they were closed for the day. The chef still made me food to go. Thank god!! I would definitely recommend this place.
My boyfriend and I came here pretty late one Friday night after a movie. We were seated right away and the wait staff was attentive and fast. They gave us bread to munch on before we ordered whicH was warm and delicious! We split a kale caesar (which was fine, nothing to  write home about) and the Montanara pizza -- which was phenomenal! Very oily (it's fried so that's to be expected)

We live close by and I will definitely be coming back! Reasonable prices, friendly staff, and good food!
It can be easy to miss being on a one way side street off the main road. But once you walk up the few iron steps and open that door, you are in a home away from home. With warm greetings from the hostess and sometimes the bartender, you have arrived. The place is cozy and inviting. There are no flat screens or loud sports fans, just a nice unpretentious Italian restaurant. Grab a table or a stool at the bar. Either way you'll get great service, delish food and good drinks.

The food is authentic with simple but fresh ingredients. The drinks vary from classic to creative. And the happy hour is a good deal in this area.

I've had a lot of items on the menu but I'll just mention my favs...

The pizza..not classic New York but real Italian. It's rustic and delicious. The dough has a crispy, fluffy, slightly salty crust and thin center. The cheese is melted perfectly with the right amount of sauce that tastes like fresh crushed tomatoes. It's really good.

The meatballs... not ground beef, either chicken or turkey but juicy and very flavorful. They are lying on a bed of sauce and topped with a generous dollop of creme fresh, plus there is a slightly cheesy component. Make sure each bite has all the ingredients so you can taste some of the best Italian meatballs in Brooklyn.

Calamari.. lightly breaded, flakey, tender and fresh. I like to squeeze the lemon, throw on some red pepper flakes and dip each one into the sauce as I eat them. Yummy and satisfying. Which pretty much sums up all their food!

Go hungry with a little time to spare, you're gonna stay a while.
Excellent pizza, nice thin chewy crispy crust.  Legit.

Spaghetti, al dente yes.

Service could be a bit more passionate
We went here two consecutive Fridays because the happy hour is so good. So this review is happy hour only. I haven't tried anything not on the happy hour menu. Basically there are 3 pizzas, 3 apps, and 3 pastas half off. So that's 7-13 dollars instead of 14- 26 And thier house wine is 6 dollars a glass and it's pretty good. I like the house red a lot.

The atmoshoere is nice too. They put nice fall flowers on the table which sets the mood. Though a table for two can get pretty crowded with drinks, food and decorations on it. Also if there is a big party the night you go, like one night we went, it can get pretty loud in there. Also the bathrooms are a bit dirty and cramped.

The food is great fresh quality. And the food comes out quick from the kitchen. We loved everything especially the pasta. It is home made and the star of all the dishes we ordered. We had both the orecchiette and the truffle fettuccine pasta. The texture of the pasta was great and the flavors were very bold and delicious.

The apps are small in size. 2 meatballs and just about 6 pieces of calamari. The calamari was fried so well and so fresh and delicious but I only got 2 pieces since we were sharing with 3 people. At 7 dollars though I get it, calamari is usually 16 dollars for a whole plate at places. Also the calamari has some fried zucchini in it so even less squid!

The pizza dough is doughy and chewy and not crispy on the bottom. The margarita pizza lacks flavor. The pizza is nothing to rave about but for 10 dollars on happy hour its pretty good. The diavola pizza is the best and has the most flavor with the salami on it compared to the two others for happy hour.

Besides the pasta being the star I also loved loved the olive oil that comes with the bread. I drench it in it. It has capers or peas or something in it and that makes it taste so good.

Also make sure you check your receipt. We had no problems the first time we went. But the second time they charged us 18 for the orecchiette pasta instead of 13. And they adjusted it though the waitress was a little rude about it.

Can't beat happy hour prices. Best happy hour for food around (4-7 mon-fri). And get the pasta!!
Came here to meet up with a bridal party I'm a part of to get to know one another. It was a good spot. They have a full bar and a nice dine in area.  The hostess seats you once most of your party arrives.  We waited until four of the six arrived (which wasn't long) and we were seated fairly quickly.

Here's what we ordered:
-  GAMBERI & AVOCADO - shrimp, avocado, baby arugula,
onion, cucumber, tomato aioli (not pictured)
-  CALAMARI FRITTI - golden fried calamari, spicy tomato sauce
-  MEATBALL DI POLLO - chicken meatballs, fresh ricotta
-  RAVIOLI DI FORMAGGIO-  ravioli filled with mozzarella, ricotta,
parmigiano reggiano, served in a truffle cream sauce, shaved pecorino
romano (not pictured)
-  (2x) SALMONE AL LIMONE - salmon fillet, mashed potatoes,
grilled asparagus, lemon capers sauce
-  (2x) LOBSTER RAVIOLI - Homemade ravioli stuffed with lobster in a mushroom vodka sauce
-  TORTELLINI DI VITELLO veal filled tortellini, italian sausage, wild mushrooms, cream sauce (not pictured)
-  We all got a bunch of alcohol, but I don't remember what they all were...

All of us enjoyed our food very much.  The only thing I can say about what I had is that it was a little more dente than I wanted, but it definitely wasn't bad.  The service was great.  Fast and the server was pretty knowledgeable when one of us wanted something that wasn't on the menu.  She gave her something that was similar...and it ended up being better than what she originally wanted.

I'd come here again and try out other things on the menu.
Been here a couple of times with friends for lunch and for dinner... great location in downtown Brooklyn and easy to get to. Staff and service are good. They have their own brick oven pizza!

Check out the lunch specials if dining for lunch - the mushroom pizza is good and one highly recommend pappardelle al funghi.

Pretty good variety on the menu so one should be able to find something to eat. If you come for dinner, make sure to save room for dessert.

Have to come back for happy hour...they have some good specials.

Restrooms are gender neutral.
4.5 stars from me.  Their food, especially pasta, was excellent.  Great chew, you can tell it's house made, no faking a texture like that; I don't care how good your chef is.  I recommend sitting at bar, while busy, I think the service was faster, and they have a massive screen showing all of the day's sports action.  I will visit again next time I'm Brooklyn!
This place has fantastic pastas and pizza. I've even ordered the steak which was very good. Ink shrimp pasta is always outstanding.
Enjoyed my dinner here. Monday's was half off on the wine and I love wine so needles to say that was what I was having to drink. I love Prosecco and their brand was really good. I also ordered red wine Nebbiolo which was also good. Food wise I ordered the shrimp arugula salad and the mussels. Have to say they were both delishhhhh. As you wait you get complimentary bread with olive oil and that was good and warm. So yummy. The place seems intimate. A place where you can have peaceful dinner even if it's by yourself. ‚ÄçThe waitress was nice and friendly.
Landed in Brooklyn with the number one son and of course he wanted pizza.  I did not so after a quick Yelp search (Italian, Pizza, Walk to) we settled on this place.  In a word, wonderful.  Casual, family friendly, but still with a cool vibe. Son had a lemonade while I enjoyed a vodka gimlet.  Yum.  We each enjoyed our Insalate one Buffalo Mozzarella with tomato and one Burata with roasted red peppers.  Also Yum.

Some loved the Margherita pizza and I thoroughly enjoyed the Branzino.   Just enough room for a house made Limoncello.

Service by Jimi and the entire team was excellent.  Clearly a place enjoyed by locals.  Will visit again.
Good selection of pizzas, though I must say I don't really go for the chewy Neapolitan style (prefer the thin-crusted Roman style). Most flexibility afforded by ordering a basic marinara and then adding your favorite toppings. I recommend prosciutto. Or anchovies and black olives. (Don't make the typical mistake of adding more than one or two toppings, it creates a confusion, not a better pizza.) Their octopus appetizer is worth trying.

I usually don't go out to Italian restaurants, but I've been on a roll lately due to an unusual pasta craving! Fortunately, this place is only a stone's throw from my office, so I came in for lunch two days in a row.

The first time was actually with some colleagues. I had no idea this place was here, but as soon as I walked in, I immediately knew I would return. I absolutely love the ample natural lighting and tall ceiling, the easy-to-navigate menu, and the bread basket (the bread was fresh!)

I got the mushroom tagliatelle on my first visit, then the squid ink pasta with shrimp the second time around. Both dishes were good! Though I would give the edge to the squid ink pasta dish - which had fresh pasta, fresh sauce, and fresh shrimp. Everything was balanced in terms of taste and texture. The sauce was lighter than I expected! The tagliatelle dish was good too, but it came with pretty basic sliced mushrooms and the pasta was a bit tougher than I would have liked. Still a solid option, though.

Service was good both times. It got busy during peak lunch hour, but it wasn't too loud, so I think it's a great option for grabbing lunch/dinner with a group!
Wow. I was here solo the night before the nearby  90th Anniversary celebration of Analog Science Fiction magazine. Through the big glass you can see a serious pizza oven. I was more in the mood for pasta, though, and all the selections looked great. I thought I was goIng to have the mushroom and truffle pasta, so I ordered a glass of red wine (the Nebbiolo).

Then I saw Frank's pasta, with Branzino and shrimp. Score, and I wasn't disappointed. The Branzino took me back to a memorable dinner in Venice where that fish was the showcase. And red wine with fish? They do that all over Puglia.

I unlocked the free limoncello check-in special. It is made in-house and is superb. Not overly sweet and a respectable punch of alcohol.

For dolce, the little bite-size Nutella pastries called Coccole. Three people could share a dessert like this. The pastries were fresh and hot, and sliced strawberries balanced the richness of the melted Nutella on the pastries.
We ordered through Grubhub/Seamless. I am sure the food was wonderful, but it arrived an hour after it was to be picked up from the restaurant. The seamless guy chose to deliver an hour's worth of other food to other people before it arrived. When it did, the pizza box was soaked through and the pizza poking out the bottom. The pizza and the pasta we ordered were ice cold. Like sitting out in the winter time cold. Not just cooled off. It had to get thrown away and my wife, son, and I ate cereal for dinner.
 Seamless ended up refunding my money after a half hour of complaining. I let the manager at the restaurant know about the poor delivery service and he recommended I try UberEats or Caviar next time. While this is not the restaurant's fault, the restaurant does get a lot of complaints from people who use GrubHub and Seamless. It's easy enough to say ""we are not responsible once it is picked up"" but this does reflect on an experience with a restaurant. Dinner was ruined. I do think in a smaller way a restaurant has to accept some responsibility if they are going to use a delivery service for their food.
 I didn't feel like giving them a low grade though, but I do think people should be warned.
 Carlos is amazing... so sad to hear that he's leaving. He's always smiling and giving a wonderful dining experience. He was one of the highlights of Forno. Best of luck!!!

 The Ravioli and the calamari are my favorites!! In the four years of getting the same thing, almost every time, they have never disappointed.
 We were here on a Friday night for a friend's birthday. We had reservations and were seated immediately. Our server brought out the menus and we ordered drinks. Once we decided on the food, we gave our order. The food came out very fast, we still haven't gotten our drinks at this point. So we waited sometime for our drinks and finally 3 of the drinks came out and we were waiting on one more. Food came out first, then the drinks and some more time later we got some bread on the table. Finally, at last, the bread.

The food and the drinks were delicious. We enjoyed our meals however there was no attention to our group. Although the server was seemingly friendly, he didn't give a damn and made us wait for drinks, bread and our check. Once we paid, we had to wait forever for him to bring back our cards.

Good food and lovely decor.
MORE THAN 5 stars - 1,000 stars!

My server, Ellie was tremendously amazing! She was professional, intelligent about to the menu, eccentric and on top of her section. Not to mention, the food was to die for! Love the Happy Hour here! I will for sure come back as long as I am in Ellie's section!
Took my parents out on a Sunday night and this place was near their hotel. Spacious, open, staff were friendly and the food was delicious. We started with the kale Cesar - it's big enough for everyone to have a little bit. I had the short ribs with mashed potatoes - definite comfort food. I tried the shrimp tagliolini (yum) and the ravioli de formaggio (also yum) - my dad commented that he would order the pollo arrosto again ""probably tomorrow"" we finished with tiramisu. Will definitely be back to try more pasta and pizza next time.
Solid spot for happy hour - the usual drink specials but the food specials are an incredible value and so delicious. The pizza and pasta are both very fresh, with generous sizes being served even for happy hour. The Diavola pizza is my favorite.

The ambiance here is also really nice. It's surprisingly spacious and bright, with a large bar area. Great for larger groups but also quite enough for intimate dates.

Service is quick and friendly. I can always count on Forno Rosso to grab a drink and a quick bite after work!
Food: 3.5 stars - chicken was overcooked and the pasta was a bit too al dente. The salad (I forgot the name, but it had olives and cucumbers) was great. Very fresh. I liked it more than the pasta (that's something I never thought I would never have to type lol).

Ambiance: one of the few relatively spacious restaurants in Brooklyn. I finally found a place that wasn't forcing me to constantly bump elbows with fellow patrons. They also have actual chairs and tables (as opposed to bar top seating + stools), hallelujah!

Service: the staff are really attentive and patient. They're also willing to tweak dishes to your liking and relay those messages to the kitchen.
My husband and I tried really hard to enjoy the food at this restaurant - we just couldn't!

We ordered the Meatball Di Pollo for an appetizer. It was just... okay.  There were good flavor elements there but they arrived to the table lukewarm with cold cheese on top.

For dinner my husband ordered the Ravioli and I ordered the Frank's Pasta, which was actually recommended. My husband ate his (he didn't want to waste our money and he's kinda greedy) and I left almost my entire plate minus 3 of the 4 shrimp. I would've sent my order back but my husband asked me not to and just said that we wouldn't return. So, I ate my shrimp as to not waste more money.

I will say, if you ever decide to visit in spite of my review, try the pizza! It looked amazing!
I enjoyed my dinner at Forno Rosso. My boyfriend and I went at happy hour and shared a meatball appetizer and both got the fettuccine bolognese, which were both very good. They also give bread and oil and we ordered drinks, I got a vodka and cranberry and he got a couple beers. Would recommend!
3.5 stars rounding down to 3 because our experience was just OK.

Came here for a glass of wine and an appetizer after finding out Wine Legend down the block was closed. It was pretty inside so we had high hopes. Ordered 2 glasses of champagne which came in gimlet glasses (odd) and the octopus appetizer. The octopus was probably my least favorite octopus dish of all time.. the beans to octopus ratio was seriously outrageous and they need to change the name as it's so misleading. 4:1 ratio BTW.

My least favorite thing about this place was the bathrooms. I already felt gross walking around town for miles and expected to feel better after washing my hands. NOPE, the bathrooms were filthy, not just filthy looking.

I feel bad giving this place 3 stars based on 1 appetizer, but if it's THAT good as people say it wouldn't have tasted meh..? Pizza's did look good, though.

Service on the other had was great.
OMG their truffle pizzaaaa is 100 stars !!!!! So so so good !! Never a disappointment every time I come here ! Great service , great food, what more coulD u want? Can't wait to be back aagain  soon!
This place is the best Italian you'll find in this area of brooklyn, hands down - one of the best across all cuisines in fact. The wild mushroom and truffle risotto and the beef short rib are my favorites, but any of the appetizers, pastas and pizzas have never disappointed either. Servers are professional and courteous, ambience is nice. Highly recommend for anyone in DTBK because the neighboring restaurants are far inferior in comparison.
We had the ravioli, pizza  steak  and soup

Everything was tasty, it was our second time there so I feel it's consistently delicious.

Try Happy  hour during the week for some special deals

Service is friendly
Forno Rosso is a favorite lunch spot. Everything is fresh. From the pasta to the pizzas. Stands out as high quality and delicious food. The place is light and airy. The Bolognese is out of this world!
Saw this place on Yelp and it exceeded expectations! Spacious, unique and true Italian restaurant. Amazing selection of pasta - even a build you own pasta section. The pizza was perfectly crisp but not burnt from the fire oven. Dessert selection was pretty great too. I highly recommend the chocolate mousse. Only call out would be that the truffle pasta is a bit too potent. It was truly amazing but a bit overwhelming of a flavor   to eat a large quantity of. I would definitely come back here!
Needed a children friendly place to eat in Downtown Brooklyn.  This is a great laid back place; totally chilled atmosphere.

The server brought bread which came with lentil beans.  It was different.  We ordered margherita pizza (happy hour price - regular size), bruchsetta (happy hour price), salmone alla siciliana, pappardelle ai funghi, and shrimp tagliolini.  All the food came out quickly.  We were slowly eating and able to
catch up without interruption.  The food was delicious.

For dessert, we ordered occole con nutella, which is very chewy dough so I recommend trying something else.

Parking can be challenging in this area.  It's a bit of a walk from the trains but totally worth it.
I'd come for happy hour before a game anytime! $4 drafts are awesome, half off pizzas and pastas too. The thing is, the happy hour pasta portions are tiny - like two shrimpy shrimps tiny - but a good value nonetheless to sample their menu. The pizza is Neapolitan style so personally I can eat one by myself + bread and apps. Like others have said, pizza is soggy in the middle because it's so thin and I suspect the mozz they use has a higher water content than the shredded stuff. So prepare to have toppings/sauce slip and slide on your hands and plates. Not a problem for me since I'm a savage but others be warned.

The diablo isn't spicy at all which was disappointing but the Margherita was delicious. The bus boys and servers here are so sweet but I'm super perturbed by one that tried to take our calamari away when there were 5 rings left! Please understand the meal is not over until I lick the marinara bowl, swallow the lemon rind, and attempt to eat the plate!!
Loved food and service here, plus fact that they are open later during week than other area restaurants.
Great experience here! Had the fettuccine Bolognese, and it was very nice. The pasta tasted very fresh and was at a great price for happy hour. Plenty of meat in the bolognese as well. Only $13! The service was exceptional and bread was very tasty
Im not sure what I missed
If I went on a wrong time (sunday lunch)
or on awkward day. but the 4.5 ratings out of almost 600 review does not justify after we came.

The pasta was blant, it was not bad but I can say I could made something better myself.

Just an honest review
I live next doors so I'm here pretty frequently.
Overall, my experience here has been pretty good. I think their excellent service is why I gave them a 4-star review, staff members always did a great job delivering great dining experience when I visited.
However, to be completely honest, the food here is hit or miss. Sometimes food here will taste so good that I want to come back the next day, other times they are just bland and flavorless...

Side note: they are a little bit on the pricy side, normally cost $85+ for two, just two entrees plus an appetizer. No alcohol and no deserts.
Staff is friendly and apologized for the atypical slow service that I received when I came for a quick lunch. I ordered the fettuccine bolognese and the flavor was spectacular! The tomato based sauce had a great zest to it, and the noodles were cooked al dente - just right for me!
This was such a great find in the downtown Brooklyn area. I was staying overnight in the area for my friend's wedding and stumbled upon this place.

I was there for a late lunch around 4pm with my husband and we got a margherita pizza, truffle ravioli and the chicken entree. The complimentary bread was deliciously chewy with a lentil and olive oil dip which was delicious. The pizza dough was yummy, but I think the middle was too thin so it was hard to eat floppy pizza - the taste was good though. The chicken dish was ok, 2 nice sized thighs with truffle mashed potatoes, brussel sprouts and mushrooms. The star of this meal though was the truffle ravioli! The cream sauce is delicious and flavorful, speckled with truffle. You get about 12 pieces and it's scrumptious!

We were super full and content with the food!

However, we couldn't help but notice the very distinct urine smell. We sat in the middle where the booths are on the opposite side of the bathrooms and we would get hit each time the door was open - which happened a lot because apparently there is an employees only room in there too. Another couple, what were leaving, also ended up making a comment on the way out. The staff was also very laid back, it was nice to have time to eat, but inconvenient to have to try hard to flag down anyone for a replacement napkin or something.

However, the food was so good, that I suggested it for dinner to the bridal party and rolled back in with 5 others. I then got to sample the shrimp and avocado salad and the beet salad - both of which were good if you want salad. I additionally was able to check out the steak, the meatballs and the squid ink pasta. All were delicious! The pasta was cooked perfectly and the sauce was really good.

Note: I didn't notice the smell if the bathroom during this dining experience and we were sitting in the same area, but at the day edge closer to the kitchen.

I would recommend and come back! :)
The wait staff is great, but that's about all.

You know that middle-class-fancy restaurant you sometimes go to when you're back home visiting your parents? The place with the cheesy faux-Italian name, where everything has that ""possibly microwaved"" vibe to it? That's this place. If you're looking at the prices and the photos of the food and wondering if it's too good to be true, it is.
Four stars just for kindness and hospitality of the staff. Excellent service and genuine interest in delivering great experience to make your customer happy.

For appetizers we ordered Bruschetta and Shishito peppers.
Bruschetta was tasty, had the right flavor and probably one of the best. Shishito peppers seldom go wrong.
We ordered a few pasta for mains; ravioli was really good however we were sorely disappointed with Frank's pasta with branzino and shrimps.
The entire dish tasted bland and flavorless.. Basically not well put together.
We let the staff know and they were immediately attentive to our complain and accountable enough to remove this off our bill, even without us asking for it.
It's not so much about the money but rather about the accountability and interest shown by the staff to get it right for the customer.
Our faux pas; while leaving the restaurant my friend's kid tripped and broke two of their bottles. The staff simply smiled and told us it's totally ok, we need not worry or feel guilty.
Such kind of excellent service makes your visit worth it.

Stumbling upon Two 8 Two made it even better.

They had some nice tables set up in front to expand their offerings for COVID, but we ate in the backyard. The service was a little slow and disjointed but was still friendly.

I would normally order a beer with my lunch, but their cocktail menu was too inviting. I had the Oaxacan Old Fashioned (Mezcal, Grand Marnier, and Chocolate Bitters). It was REALLY good!

Onto my burger - I had the Breakfast Burger. It was a 5 ounce, fresh ground, burger with a fried egg, cheddar cheese, bacon, and their house sauce. The burger was cooked perfectly and super juicy. The fried egg was a little overcooked but still did have a little ""run"" left to it. Altogether an excellent burger and I appreciated the smaller size. Burgers have become too huge and Two 8 Two's made getting out and walking afterward a breeze. No burger bloat.

If you find yourself hungry on Atlantic Avenue do yourself a favor and enjoy Two8Two!
Our good burger buds at 282 have been around for a while. I discovered this by checking my draft reviews for them! I am looking forward to taking a nice walk up here again once we're out of Covid quarantine.

Why? The times we've been there they've had consistently good service combined with their shake shack like burgers (in a good way). Yes, you have to pay extra for fries but they're delicious, so ultimately it's worth it. They are thicker than McD fries and come with some skin on the tips. Eat them while they're hot for maximum crispiness.

The backyard with picnic tables is perfect for a late spring day (especially with the kiddos) and inside is cozy as a backup.

We got takeout through doordash the other night from here for dinner, and it hit the spot! Even though the food took awhile to get to us, it was still warm because it was wrapped in aluminum foil inside the takeout containers. The burgers, I got the two8two burger and my friend got another one, were juicy and delicious! The poblano peppers weren't spicy but added good flavor to the burger, and the caramelized onions I asked for added a nice sweetness too. Definitely a solid spot for burgers! The onion rings were good too, homemade as well, though these suffered a bit more due to the long transit time. (No fault of the restaurant, of course.) A spot I'd be sure to order from again when in the mood for a burger, and will put on my list to stop by when things open up again!
Had the 282 burger. A bit pricey, considering the burgers don't come with fries but it's so worth it. They're not big burgers but they are filling! More importantly, they're delicious. It's been a while since I've been there but maybe there's a 282 sauce on them? I'm trying to remember the details but in my mind's eye there's just a close-up of me biting into that succulent little ball of future cardiovascular disease as angels sing in the background.

Get the burger. Get a beer. Tip the workers.

Set aside some alone time to eat this baby so no one interrupts the magic.
I came here on a fluke, my coworkers and I were on our way out of town. We came to New York for business. We were hungry and no where to park. So we pulled to the side of the road r
to check Yelp for places to eat. I saw the bar and decided to pop in for food because we were hungry. So 2 of us stayed in the car while I ordered togo.
I ordered the turkey burger (which was the best burger I've had in my life). One of my coworkers had the regular burger with grilled onions (she was making groining sounds while eating). I'd say she was satisfied. And the other had tuna melt. We all sat in the car (parked illegally) and ate our food. I wished I ordered another to go. That was 1 year ago, I still think about that burger. Awesome Guys!
While the burgers here were definitely solid, everything else we had was not. The Two8two burger was tasty but a bit small. The drinks were a little dissapointing for the price, and the fries... The fries were an insult to Potato-kind.

They were somehow less cooked than an actual raw potato. By the time they came to our table, they were colder than Russia in the winter, and were blander than an Imagine Dragons concert in the spring.
If shake shack is a flying plane, 282
For like an average price of maybe $2 more, u get a burg that's leagues above. Extraordinary every time, have tried all the (meat) burgers on the menu. The one with poblanos--f* yea. Or the billy burger? Yum yum. Just order here and don't forget to add fries because they're good.
It has been two years after returning to Brooklyn, and I was delighted to see that 282 was still around. The lamb burger and feta cheese fries were as scrumptious as it was 2 years ago. It continues to be my favorite burger joint.
I was in the mood for a burger, but nowhere I had tried before would hit the spot. I found two8two, saw their menu, and figured they were worth a shot- and I was completely correct. The two8two burger is one of the absolute best I've had in my life. It was cooked well, topped well with extras, and wrapping it in foil kept in warm on the walk home (which I cannot say about most places I pick up from!). I was hesitant to get onion rings, as most of the time there too soggy or broken when getting take out, but they were packaged well and tasted amazing! The right level of crispness you expect from onion rings. Topping it all of with their Manhattan, it was a divine meal. I will undoubtedly be treating myself to this place more often!
Today, my girlfriend asked me those four magical words that every romantic dreams of: ""wanna get burgers today?"" Yes I did, and, after consulting my Yelp bookmarks, we picked two 8 two Burgers on Atlantic St.

Sitting at the bar, we ordered a couple of Sunday happy hour elderflower cocktails. We looked over the menu while sipping the sweet beverages. Burgers are great, but hello, what's this about a blackened chicken sandwich? One of those, a two 8 two burger, and an order of chili cheese fries. The food came out all at once, at which time I ordered a New York Sour signature cocktail.

The two 8 two burger includes poblano peppers, which is as close to a green chile cheeseburger as I've seen this side of the Mississippi. Great flavor, not spicy, the beef patty tasted delicious and was cooked medium rare, as we ordered.

The chicken sandwich was also a home run. I loved the flavor of the spices on the chicken--the cayenne came through particularly well. This is an awesome choice for those seeking relief from red meat. (Vegans/vegetarians would be better off inquiring about the Beyond meatless patties.)

The chili cheese fries, unfortunately, were lacking. I applaud the choice to use real cheddar, but unfortunately it all congealed into a hard top layer that made the fries difficult to access. Perhaps Velveeta or nacho cheese queso would work better.
One word defines Two 8 Two Bar & Burger: remarkable. The staff is pleasant and the place itself is adorable. Two 8 Two Bar & Burger is one of these places where all the menu items look wonderful, I had Greek Salad and it was amazing. The team was very courteous and service is excellent. Overall, I love Two 8 Two Bar & Burger.
Ordered the Billy... and it may have been the best burger I've ever had. Why? Because the patty alone - can be just that - alone.
Buttery and flavorful. The caramelized red onions and the sauce are extra delicious treats as well.
TLDR: French fries 1/5. Burger 5/5 Avg 3/5.

The French fries were mediocre. I had the chili cheese fries and the cheddar tasted like it was just reheated and plastic. I had the 50/50 burger and that was actually pretty good. i wdl come back for the burger.
Came here with a friend on a rainy Friday evening before COVID had us all sheltered at home. We were in the mood for some good burgers, beer, and fries, and Yelp led us here.

We arrived just in time for happy hour and got our orders in -- the beer selection was your usual 6-10 on tap, with bottles. We both went with IPAs upon the suggestion of the bartender. Because our priority was fries, we ordered those first -- sweet potatoe for her, and regular for me (the loaded Greek ones held no temptation for me; I had a sole focus, and that was to get deep fried potato chunks). We were also starving so we went with some burgers: the Pub Burger and the Half and Half burger.

The highlight was definitely the burger -- they really hit the spot and were cooked to perfection (medium/medium-rare) despite them not asking us ahead of time our preference, which was fine by me. They were extremely flavourful, juicy, and generously portioned. The burgers definitely had us immediately bookmarking this spot for the future. However, the fries did not taste as good as they looked on pictures -- they were very run of the mill, nothing special. Moreover, the bartender was a bit hands-off despite it not being a very busy night.

We'd definitely come back for the burgers, but service is a bit slow, so be warned.
I always pass by this restaurant and I've finally decided to come check it out! Currently the patio is open and there are tables on the sidewalk in front. I came with my bf around 6:30/7 and we were able to be seated right away. I  ordered the double cheeseburger, he ordered the half and half and we shared an order of Greek fries. The double cheeseburger is HUGE! Each patty is roughly  an inch thick. It was definitely challenging trying to get the bun and both patties for a bite. The overall taste was fantastic. It had the perfect amount of salt and the fat ratio was great. I really enjoyed the double cheeseburger. I also got to try my bf's order. The burger itself was also delicious, but I think the poblano peppers really made it. The Greek fries were a nice addition to our meal. There are huge chunks of feta sprinkled on top. I'm not sure if the fries are double fried, but they were crispy and so so good. I will definitely be back to try some of the other burgers on the menu!
Two8two is one of our regular spots. We've been coming ever since we moved to the neighborhood a couple of years ago, at least 1x/month.
With covid, we've been getting delivery. They're always prompt, the wait is never too long, and the food arrives hot. They wrap their burgers in foil so they stay warm!

They have a small back patio open and 3-4 streetside tables available right now for outdoor dining. Hopefully they can add heatlamps and continue!

My only less-favorable thing is the fries. This seems to be pretty consistent in the recent reviews on Yelp. They're thin and taste like frozen fries (a bit bland, not potatoey). I wish they did fresh ones, you can really taste the difference. I would be more willing to pay the extra few bucks for better fries. Their sweet potato fries are good!
Located at '282' Atlantic Avenue (somebody is a clever wordsmith), Two 8 Two Bar & Burger serves up high quality burgers and a solid selection of draft beer in a family-friendly neighborhood style pub.  Service is incredibly attentive, warm, AND down-to-earth - which makes this spot deserving of repeat business.

The menu is pretty straight forward.  Order your choice of burger and a side, a drink or two, and sit back and relax.  We thought it was pretty cool that they offer a dedicated hot dog menu (classic, garden, bacon cheddar, chili cheddar, and two8two dog).  But, we chickened out and went with two Pub Burgers and a side of fries.  The patties were tasty, well-seasoned, and cooked to perfection!  Our only gripe was the two8two sauce.  There was simply too much of it and the flavor overpowered the dish.  It was good, but balance would have been appreciated.

Also, this place offers outdoor seating in the back.  You should definitely take advantage of this while you still can!
*This review is for take out:
We decided to try this neighborhood spot on a Sunday night. We ordered through Caviar and it was ready in about 15 minutes, which we really appreciated. Everything came in very nice packaging and put carefully in the bag. Our order consisted of onion rings, sweet potato fries, chili cheese fries, two8two dog, Billy burger and Pub burger.
The sweet potato fries were a bit soggy, which I will blame on the time it took to bring them home. Some still had a crunch and were very good. The chili cheese fries were amazing! I am usually not a fan but ended up eating most of my husband's side order... the onion rings were very crunchy and light, one of the best I have ever had!
The Billy burger and the Pub were very similar since we added bacon and pickles to the Billy, with the Pub being a larger version. The brioche buns were toasted in butter so they didn't fall apart, which I loved. The meat was also very high quality, as well as the bacon. Great burgers. I didn't try the hot dog, but it was huge! It had a lot of toppings but my husband said it was not overwhelming. He particularly liked the whole strip of poblano pepper.
I think all items could have used a bit more salt, which is a bit about my personal taste. However, the burger could have had its great flavor enhanced by some extra salt.
Will definitely order from this place again in the future
Very solid place for a burger and a beer. Been here a few times and never disappointed. I particularly like their use of poblano peppers with their signature burger, great flavor. Was walking by a few days ago with my girlfriend and noticed that they were also selling to-go spicy margaritas, so we picked a couple up on our way home. Very good decision. Made with fresh lime juice, they weren't too sweet and had a nice kick.
This place is under the radar and is never listed among the best burgers on the Foodie sites. The burgers are delicious. The most popular is the pub burger which comes with cheddar, bacon, grilled onions and special sauce. The meat is locally sourced from a popular butcher. The only con for the burger was that it was slightly too greasy. The hot dogs are also very good. They are a foot long and good fot sharing. The bun is toasted with butter which is a nice touch. Two8Two is worth a visit if you are Hamburger conisseur.
This isn't a super fancy place and the decor leaves a lot to be desired, but you really come here for the burgers. They're simple, but delicious and cooked perfectly to order. The Pub burger seemed intimidating on the menu, so I ordered the Two8Two burger with bacon. It's essentially the same thing, except that it has peppers and is smaller in size. I regretted not getting the Pub burger because I still wanted more and the burger was damn good. The patty was juicy and the burger itself didn't feel heavy in the stomach. I was also surprised to find that fries don't automatically come with the burger. Major sad face. But if you do order fries, it's a nice portion. The Greek fries sound better than they actually are. The cheese and herbs just seemed to be haphazardly thrown onto the fries. All in all, worth a visit, but don't expect too much.
Looking for an amazing burger in a chill environment in the Downtown Brooklyn neighborhood? ... Look no further!

Food - (5/5)
The burgers are top notch. Patties are delivered fresh daily from the local butcher shop, Paisano's. I frequent this butcher shop weekly and can vouch for their amazing quality beef. You can really taste it in the burger. I tried to breakfast burger which had perfectly crispy bacon but my egg was cooked a bit too much. That's on me for not specifying my preference. The Half & Half burger is solid too. You can't go wrong with any of the burgers honestly. The hot dogs are foot long which justifies the $10 price tag. Didn't try them, but th bartender devoured one and said it's his favorite thing there.

Ambiance - (5/5)
Chill and casual. Went here on a Sunday night with friends and we sat at the bar. Great service and two small TV playing NBA games. The bartender made some delicious old fashioned as well.

Location - (4.5/5)
Convenient location right on Atlantic so a close walk for any of the Downtown Brooklyn neighborhoods. Coming from Park Slope might be a hike but it's well worth it.

Value - (5/5)
Exceptional food and service at a fair price. Burgers range from $10-13 and don't come with any sides. The sweet potato fries are a great addition if you're looking for something to compliment the burger.
I would never return to this place. The food here is beyond bland. Nothing interesting here at all. For the price I paid and the good reviews they have I expected wayyy more. The burger had absolutely no flavor. On top of the bad food the service was subpar at best. My food came out wrong and the wait was so although it was not busy at all. One of the few times Yelpers have let me down. Will definitely not be returning.
Small Spot , Burger was really good. Came across it on my work travels. Definitely would come back. I honestly expected more of a selection of burgers, just going by the name. Price was a little too high in my opinion, but it's expected being its nyc.
I wasn't blown away. Burgees spots are so competitive in Brooklyn that every burger spot you try it's always expected to be better than the last.
I had the veggie burgers with grilled onions and onion rings . The onion rings were very good. My burger was just ok. I know it's veggie but that doesn't mean bland and tasteless. I felt like it was missing something.
I also thought they were pricey as well. $70 for 3 burgers and a kids meal with chicken tenders.
I'll have the onion rings again for sure but I'll pass on the burger.
Last meal before another attempted strict diet. Ordered sweet potato fries, onion rings and Two 8 two burger medium well to go. The sweet potato fries weren't crispy but had the authentic, not frozen taste. The onion rings were real pieces of onion and crispy - not the fast food joints. Both fried items were not grossly oily or salty but instead hit the spot for a deep fried craving. Now for the burger, we believe that all burgers should have this bun. Pretty much a potato bun keeping the patty warm and moist. The entire combination was just perfect. Each bite had such flavor and texture. The pepper gave it the real touch similar to the purpose of a pickle but to a whole new level. The burger would've been even better with tomato and lettuce. Overall, this was a great meal that really hit the craving for us and totally worth the drive on the highway.
Came here based off the Yelp reviews and I got a classic burger with bacon. I must say that my fellow yelpers got this one right. Burger was cooked well. Fries were very tasty. The pickles had the perfect crunch and sourness to them too. Great outdoor seating area, I was happy!
My friend suggested this fun-sports bar-ish spot in the Boerum Hill area. I tried the ""Hot Date"" cocktail, Impossible Burger, and sweet potato fries. All 3 absolutely hit the spot! The Hot Date was kind of like a spicy, tangy, and sweet eggnog. I had two (hey, it's Thursday!) and felt all warm and tipsy afterwards, just like a hot date should feel. ;) The Impossible Burger with cheddar cheese (extra $1) was melt-in-your-mouth good, but would add ketchup.  Lettuce and tomato automatically come on the side. Sweet potato fries were solid - no complaints here. They've got 2 bathrooms that are clean enough, and service was attentive without being annoying. They brought me an extra ketchup without me asking. Great job.
Delivery was a complete nightmare
Ordered a burger at 7:52pm, didn't receive until 10:33
Yes, you've read that correctly.
I was a hangry bitch.
Called and the manager made excuses, took no responsibility and directed me to call caviar.
Never ordering from here again.
I'm not sure how this spot averages 4 stars with 600+ reviews but I was really deceived by the reviews.  I've had better burgers and fries at white castle. The fries were honestly such a disaster. McDonalds serves fries that are warmer, saltier, and crisper. My burger came with caramelized onions but my onions were barely even cooked. The burger patty itself was really mediocre and thin. The presentation was very offputting. My burger came on a lone white plate, it felt like I was in a back alley diner. You eat with your eyes as well and I was really not impressed. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone because honestly, you can go into a fast food restaurant and get the same tasting burger for significantly cheaper. I was really disappointed with my dinner and felt like I wasted money. The waitress also spent her time on her phone at the booth instead of tending to her customers. We waited 10+ minutes for the check when there was only one other table of customers and we were in her direct view.  I rarely feel so negative about a place but this spot really made me feel like I wasted my time, money, and appetite.
Great burgers and fries, chill staff. I've been coming here for years and love the relaxed feel. They are serious about their burgers, too. I remember one year during the Atlantic Antic street fair, they ran out of their locally sourced beef way before the fair ended. Not ones to sacrifice quality, they just stopped serving burgers, to the disappointment of many. I appreciated the fact that they wouldn't substitute a lesser quality meat and chuckled at the poor planning. This isn't a chain, folks. You get what you get! Just relax, have a drink, and enjoy it for what it is. You won't regret it.

ETA: I always stick to a bacon cheeseburger w/onions, sans 282 sauce (and sans bun - it's still good!) If you get a burger with the 282 sauce, I suggest you ask for the sauce on the side the first time around.  Also, the burgers are extremely juicy. A lot of grease will drip onto your plate. If that's a problem for you, you may want to order something else. I'm not a huge fan of that but love the burgers anyway!
I had the two 8 two burger which consists of toasted poblano Chiles, cheese and their special sauce. I enjoyed it very much and although I thought it was small, it was pretty filling!
The potato buns they used were the perfect match with the burger.
My guy had the double cheeseburger which he really enjoyed. He even compared it to the shake shack and said that it was pretty similar taste wise!
We ordered a side of fries and it was a very generous portion. They gave us enough fries to go around and I do love fries.
The only downfall I'd say is that they charge for side of pickles. I get that it's only $1 but there was only 3 small sized pickles.. and also, the burgers don't come with fries on the side. If you want them, you need to order them separately.

Besides that, taste wise they're pretty good!
My second visit here.  This time I had to write a review

The Food:  I had the pub burger and it was fantastic.  The bun was so soft and lightly toasted on the grill.  the burger was cooked perfectly, juicy with a great crust on it and it was seasoned perfectly.  All around great burger.  If I had to add one slight criticism it would be that  the bacon, while tasty, just didn't have the pop the rest of the ingredients had.  I don't feel like the bacon was loved when it was cooked.  I also had the onion rings which were battered which i prefer over breadcrumbs.

The Beer:  This place has a nice selection of your normal not expensive go to beers and some good local and non local crafts.  I've been twice and found craft beers on the menu that I had not had before both times.  (believe me that is impressive)

Great place for a burger and a beer.  (sorry I forgot photos)
Yummm! So juicy and flavorful. Their meat was good quality. So good! Their sweet potatoe fries were delicious and not saggy at all. They also have a full bar. Seating was plentiful.
I was in mood for a burger( not fast food burger) and pulled over as I was in downtown Brooklyn area.  I used yelp and decided to give this place a chance.  Glad I did!  Was a takeout order because of COVID and that can be problematic but right now that is all you can do.  Anyway, I like the way everything was packaged and it was ready when I came to pick it up.  The food was great.  I ordered the Pub Burger and it was cooked the way I requested.  So good and juicy.  The bun was packaged on the side like I asked and the sauce was in a nice small container.  The sweet potato fries were cooked with perfection and survived re heating nicely.
Finally a place that has an efficient online system and a chef who fulfills your request.  Good job.  Will be a patron even after the pandemic.  Might even go in for a sit down!  Will recommend to my meat eating buddies!
Store changed its hours to closing at 9 and never updated their site or Yelp. Waste of time
Went for Good Beer Passport Dinner

Food - 2/5. The poblanos were really overpowering on the burger. Despite being roasted pretty well, the large slices of poblanos with their stringy texture did not fit well when eating a sandwich. Since you're cutting with your teeth, it wasn't a good texture especially when you have everything else to chew at the same time. Beef patty itself was pretty average and the two8two sauce was barely noticeable. There was a reason they served the burger with ketchup on the side.

Service - 4/5. Friendly and courteous.

Value - 2/5. Their namesake two8two burger runs at $10.50. It sounded good on paper, but the actual burger itself wasn't good to eat. Despite the price point, it doesn't come with any sides at all either. I definitely expected more.

Parking - Street (Free)
Before I start, I need to get this out of the way: Wow! ""Two 8 Two Bar & Burger"" (Named after the address) is a gem in Brooklyn that needs to be shared. This popular hot spot is a great place for hanging out with friends, or dining with a date. I came here by chance, but am grateful to have found it. Let me get into what happened.
I was looking for a place to eat with my brother while we were in Brooklyn. I pulled out my phone and went to Yelp. Long and behold, Yelp did not fail me. ""Two 8 Two"" came up on my radar. It was a ten minute walk from my job, so that was a plus. To add they had a weather guard up at the front door, so you know it wasn't going to be cold inside. Inside it was quaint and long. Once you walk past the bar, there's seating in the back. The hostess sat us in Brianna's section, a waitress that was very friendly. She filled our glasses quick and immediately took our orders. Looking around I loved the red walls and wooden seating. The place was tight, but seemed to get the most out of the space. In the summer, they have a patio in the back, if you feel like dining outside. Once I got the lay of the land out of the way the food came out. No surprise one order of fries were huge, so sharing is recommended. The new double burger was big and juicy to add. Looking at all the cheese and beef took me to my happy place. But it wasn't till I bit into the burger and tasted the beef and 282 sauce, that I started to sing. It was an incredible match. They only offer two types of cheese (Cheddar and gouda) But I understand why. The burger is made to support the taste of those two cheeses, they simply made a masterpiece and want you to experience it. That added with the home made fries and you have true fine dining. I would one hundred percent recommend this place. Great atmosphere, good service, and amazing food, make this a Brooklyn restaurant that's going to be on Atlantic for years to come.
The best drink (Bees knees)
Good burgers too. Love coming here late at night enjoying the music and environment.
I've only had the Greek fries from here and I've returned many times to order them again.

Great for a date, anniversary, celebration - there was some thing about the magical allure of the candlelight lantern setting amidst a secret garden while simultaneously floating on the water with the entire Manhattan skyline looming in the back while Chopin and Vivaldi floated in the backdrop of the evening.

The food was fixed price $125 per person and afforded the perfect amount of fullness and explosion of flavors.

My favorite was the hearty shrimp appetizer We did sweet chili sauce and grilled corn mash and the black Seabass fillet even though the signature dish of the Branzino sea bass was deboned -much to my lazy delight And was feeling owing to it's toasted fried crumb topping as well as the shrimp Layer it was wrapped in.

The desert Trio along with the four cookies was the perfect cap of the meal. My favorite personal dessert was the Brooklyn Bridge chocolate ganache tart on a bed of raspberry pur√©e, but the light peach sorbet was almost bursting in its freshness and was a close second.

Overall between service, ambience, food options, seafood options for my pescatarian Muslim palate, A new favorite is found in Brooklyn
A gem of NYC with a heart of gold.

The River Cafe helped plan the most amazing wedding day imagined, in less than 3 weeks (you heard that right!). The team (from Alyson to the valet) went above and beyond to help make our special day unforgettable. All in a time of COVID.

We were able to have the ceremony, cocktail hour and reception all outdoors - per federal and state guidelines. All the tables were socially distant and they provided the flexibility for family and friends to celebrate within their comfort level.

The food - this was our first time here but if you read any credible review you know there is nothing like it.

The views - just take a walk around the venue and see for yourself.

Thank you River Cafe!
Best parts of our dinner - great decor and location, friendly and funny waiter, attentive staff and service.

For the price point, the overall experience was acceptable but I don't think I'd ever revisit, other than for the location. There are many restaurants with cheaper fixed price menus and better food.

The best dish from our night was the octopus appetizer that we got. It's probably in the top octopus dishes I've ever had. Everything else was good but not amazing.
Meh, I've been here before covid and it was good. Went today and they refused to sit me by the water because I wasn't a regular. I asked what it takes to be a regular and they said you need to eat here 40 years. F*ck that. I ate for 3 hours and only 2 of 5 water front spots were filled. To the snooty blonde lady they refused to let me eat by the water at tables that would go empty, screw you. I wont be back again. Why do do you treat non existent customers better than actual customers?

Won't be back again. If you won't a special dinner, don't go here. Apparently they only care if you have been going 40 years years. To everyone else, pound sand.
The River Caf√© seeks to provide a best-in-class fine dining experience in one of the world's most beautiful settings. Regrettably, it fell well short of that standard on my recent visit. While the food was on par with expectation, a discerning customer will likely take exception to the service and overall experience. If you are hoping to create a perfect evening, you may wish to look elsewhere.

After calling me twice to confirm my reservation and inquire about the special occasion of my visit - in both instances acknowledging my request for a table with a view - the Ma√Ætre D' promptly led us to the far corner of the dining hall, about as far away from the window as possible. While I appreciate that seating requests cannot always be honored, I could not help but feel disappointed at one of the most unfortunately located tables in the house, especially at a time of 25% reduced capacity.

Worse, however, was the seating arrangement. It is unclear to me why an establishment of renown would presume to seat a party of two directly next to one another instead of across. No, it was not Valentine's Day, and the restaurant knew I'd be dining with a senior family member because I had told them so twice (at their request, no less). It caused the Ma√Ætre D' some embarrassment to admit no real alternative was available, and I was needlessly forced into being persistent to secure a different section of the corner wall. This, at least, offered an 'L' shaped arrangement such that my elderly mother didn't have to keep her head turned 90 degrees all evening to converse with me. I am reasonably certain the seating arrangement would have been the same had I been taking out a business partner or formal guest - a proposition I am now unlikely to pursue in the future.

Despite the minor improvement, seating remained awkward. The vintage table lamps are cabled and plugged into outlets on the floor, leading to unnecessary interference with tableware and guests' legs. The clumsy table experience was further exacerbated by booth seating so tight you had to move the entire table every time someone stands up or sits down. Again, at 25% indoor dining capacity, I would have expected to feel less cramped.

Dinner service was carried out by a round robin of waitstaff and bussers of which there were so many I lost track. This made the experience feel impersonal, confusing, and inefficient. Upon requesting a wine pairing in response to multiple inquiries about my drink order, I was repeatedly passed off to the sommelier, who either never arrived or failed to introduce himself as such. I'd like to believe he was never consulted, however, given I was initially offered the last bit of overly oxidized Chianti from a bottle that had clearly been open for too long. When I declined, the waiter was surprised to learn I was in fact having duck and not steak, as he had previously thought. What good is having a sommelier when a guest's dinner order is not properly communicated to them?

Although the food was good, the gaffes continued: A dense loaf of bread served as a starter was only cut once through the middle, leaving us with two large chunks our tiny butter knives were no match for. The irony of being adamantly reminded about a restaurant's formal dress code in advance of my arrival, only to then be forced to work through a fistful of bread with my bare hands for lack of proper silverware, was certainly not lost on me.

Far worse, however, was that we were not asked at any point during our evening whether we were enjoying our meal or needed anything else. While I share the waitstaffs faith in Chef Steelman, being Michelin starred does not absolve an establishment of its duty to uphold the most basic tenets of meal service. This was truly a faux pas and made me feel like a paying customer rather than a valued guest.

Overall, the food was good, but the persistent undertow of disappointment and frustration took away substantially from what could and should have been a more enjoyable experience. While I may or may not return at some point in the future, I am for now left with the impression that The River Caf√© takes itself a little too seriously given the actual standard to which it (under)performs on its promise of a true fine dining experience.
This is second in a series retroacity reviews. What is a retroacity review you ask? It's restaurants that have held such an impact throughout the years that must receive a well-deserved review. We did visit not long ago, however the pictures are from a 2016 visit, since it provided the most memorable of experiences.

Sheer elegance and extravagant venue are what comes to mind from this fine establishment. Every time we come I'm still amazed by the beauty of the vistas. The water glistening off our cityscape makes me proud to be a lifetime New Yorker.

Refined etiquette is implemented by all staff from the coat room to the manager. The cuisine is always excellent, enhanced by the exquisite presentation. The River cafe experience never falters and is always excellent.

I implore myself to make a visit to the River Cafe at least once a year. My wife always thanks me for a wonderful time at such an amorous setting. It has continued to live up to its reputation as one of the most romantic restaurants NYC has to offer.
Rude arrogant staff , could've been better for the price, location and interior looks. Disappointed.
Fantastic view, delicious food and good service. Everything you want and need in a romantic outing for any occasion.

My wife and I wanted to celebrate our wedding anniversary somewhere special and, immediately, our very own borough's The River Cafe jumped to mind. Sure, there's plenty of romantic, beautiful, elegant, expensive restaurants in NYC to choose from, but it was somewhere we always wanted to dine at because of our familiarity with the restaurant ... and we practically passed by it every time while driving back into Brooklyn.

There are many great things about The River Cafe, but before even dining here, people who do want to come here will love that they offer reservations 1 year in advance, which is awesome and rare. What's not awesome though is that the area that the restaurant is located in is tight and street parking is not always available, however the restaurant does offer free valet parking.

We arrived for our 6pm reservation a bit earlier than we anticipated and were still seated immediately. If you do arrive early, I highly recommend taking advantage of the scenery and getting a few photos in before dining. At the time, the restaurant was relatively empty with the exception of a few parties being seated. When making our reservation, we had requested for a seat next to the window overlooking downtown Manhattan and we were glad to see that the restaurant obliged. The service throughout our meal was good, but a bit mistimed at moments as we were interrupted multiple times with questions while chewing our food. Nevertheless, it far from ruined our meal, but it was a bit awkward 2-3 times.

The menu was pre-fixe style (appetizer, entree and dessert) at a set price and a bit extra for the chef's tasting menu. We had no intentions of dining for 3-4 hours, so we decided on making pre-fixe selections. My wife ordered the Sea Scallop and Pork Belly, Lobster and Hot Souffle, while I went with the Octopus, Crescent Farms Duck and Chocolate Brooklyn Bridge.

First, we were greeted by a small Amuse-bouche, which was a nice touch to kick off our meals. Second, everything was delicious. We loved the food. Everything was as fresh as can be and well plated. The serving size for the duck was actually quite generous compared to everything else, but then again it might have been one of the less expensive options on the pre-fixe menu? In addition, we loved the extra touch the restaurant put on our desserts to wish us a happy anniversary, so do expect that if you mention you are coming here for an occasion.

Everything was close to perfect except for the mistimed visits from the waiters. The food was excellent and the view was everything we thought it would be. What did surprise us though was that the restaurant got very crowded (on a Sunday evening) and the noise level really picked up just before we left. The dim lighting helped in creating a romantic atmosphere, but the amount of noise took a little bit of that away, so if you're looking for that romantic meal it might be ideal to come here for an early dinner before the restaurant gets overly packed.
Five star all around...the location, the food, the service, the clientele, the atmosphere, the table settings, the flowers, the crockery, the cutlery, the pianist.... sublime.

Came here for my husband's 70th bday, and we received plenty of happy birthday greetings aswell as a chocolate mini dessert plate, after our lunch. What a lovely touch.

The views and location are phenomenal, it does not get better than this. For a special occasion this is the PLACE TO BE.

Every detail is met, even crystallised salt on top of the personalised chilled butter. My fois gras was divine, smooth as silk.  The herb crust on the main of duck was also wonderful.

A meal and memory to remember for ever.
WOW I am so impressed with this place ! I celebrated my birthday here with my family and I loved every minute of it ! From the outstanding service , to the attention to detail , the view , the ambiance and the food everything was top notch ! I mean could you expect any less from a fine dinning establishment !! Honestly I thought people only came here for the view but the food was amazing . From the moment we sat down to the moment we left we were catered to . We sat outdoors and there were heat lamps and space heaters . We also felt pretty safe . The food was a 3 course prefixe meal for $130 ( not including tax and tip ) which included appetizer , entree and dessert . I've included pictures of each dish . The plates were small but surprisingly very filling ! We left completely satisfied and raving about our experience . Yes this is a splurge type of place but if you've got a special occasion definitely give it a try ! It's so beautiful ! Also definitely make a reservation or else you will not be seated .
I booked a dinner reservation for Thursday night a week in advance. Upon arrival we were greeted and had  complimentary glasses of champagne due to having to wait almost in the rain (also I'm assuming for being newly engaged as I put in the reservation notes as well). It was POURING rain as thunderstorms were forecasted, but the way River Cafe was set up there was no problem having comfort for the patrons that went. It was STILL a packed house at 9 pm. Service was impeccable, attention to detail even though it was a packed house and there was a downpour, the waiters were attentive and had such a great attitude and friendly. My glass was never empty!
The prefix meal that my fianc√© and I had tasted so freaking great: appetizer shrimp and dumplings, the main course fianc√© had risotto and I had duck, and the dessert was a mix of deserts cake shaped to look like Brooklyn bridge, sherbet, etc. Most importantly: the view. The view is incredible and beautiful and made the experience that much better. Thank you River Cafe to end the day to being newly engaged and making it more special!
I love to come here to celebrate my Anniversary, service is outstanding from the beginning to end. The view is one of the most beautiful and romantics. Our food was delicious and perfectly presented. Love the signature Broolyn Bridge dessert, and they always take the time to congratulate us for our Anniversary.
Went here for my husband's birthday and had a lovely time. It's definitely old school Italian (jackets required, for example) and the views are amazing. You can't request window seating in advance but the host/hostess does his/her best to accommodate. We actually ended up with an even better seat than directly next to the window, so both of us would have the view when facing forward. Plus the table offered more privacy than the window ones.

I will say while the food was good, it didn't blow me away. You come here for the service, experience, the views and the bridge chocolate dessert! Worth visiting once as it's a bucket list entry.
Came here for dinner on Sunday night with a group of 5 to celebrate a birthday and had a great time! Our waiter was very lively and knowledgeable about the menu. We did the prefix menu so we could choose an appetizer, main entr√©e and dessert. I got the pear salad, strip steak and hot souffle. Everything was delicious! Others at the table got oysters, octopus, lamb, and fish. Everyone was happy with their choices. The Brooklyn Bridge cake was a popular choice for dessert - very creative display!

The dinner was definitely on the fancy/pricey side (men are required to wear jackets). The views are great and you feel like you are really on the water. The outside of the restaurant was really cute too. They had string lights all over a large patio garden. All of the staff was extremely friendly and welcoming without making the place feel too ""stuffy"". I would definitely recommend if you are looking to celebrate something and get dressed up.

The area around the restaurant in DUMBO is really nice to walk around as well.  It is directly under the Brooklyn Bridge!
This place is a fairytale! Absolutely amazing ambiance. From the music to the lights. If you are ever thinking of going, GO!! As for the food, it was also incredible. Everyone there was dressed up but there is no dress code (unless I missed it).
Perfect restaurant to spend our anniversary! We had an early reservation at 5:30pm and arrived just before our table was ready. We were greeted at the door of our car with valet service who opened our doors and held umbrellas over our heads to ensure we weren't drenched by the rain. Little things like that make the experience perfect from the get go.

We sat at the bar inside the restaurant and the bartender was very knowledgable about the menu. We wanted a bottle of champagne and he directed us to their Sommelier, who happened to be adorable. He not only knew the bottles well but he was excited about a couple of the choices. He pointed us in the direction of a bottle around $172, which was FANTASTIC. To be honest, I would have paid more for it because it couldn't have paired better with our dishes. Before the bottle was opened, our table was ready and it was right next to the window so we had a perfect view. We were able to see the Statue of Liberty, Brooklyn Bridge, and Manhattan. Perfect.

Our server, Flavio, was exceptional and kind. He asked if we were celebrating anything and we told him it was our anniversary to which he told us a bit about himself. I love when servers at high-end restaurants aren't snooty and remain personable and kind. He was wonderful and I hope to have him again as our server.

Food:
*Appetizers*

- Wild Shrimp: shrimp cooked to perfection and topped with crab, white asparagus, and a tasty sauce. I would order this again.

- Foie Gras: the best I've had thus far in NY. It was prepared two ways, which made it a fun dish to try with my spouse. Served with two pieces of toasted bread. I would order this again.

*Main Courses*

- Lobster: this is the dish I should've ordered but I got a few bites! It was cooked perfectly and served with some sort of lobster salad on the side, which was to die for! This is the main course to order.

- Black Sea Bass: this was my main course and I was very happy with it. I thought the stuffed asparagus was a nice addition and matched each bite of the sea bass. The 3 raviolis were phenomenal and I wish I could've had a few more.

*Dessert*

- Souffle: we both had the souflee, which was served with ice cream, and a piece of chocolate. Absolutely wonderful.

Thank you for making our anniversary memorable. We hope to visit again before we leave.
**Pre-COVID*** Came for my birthday dinner as a treat from the bf - definitely a special occasion kind of place. Honestly, what an experience. The location is outstanding: on the waterfront overlooking downtown Manhattan, with a cute little park in front that happened to be hosting a wedding when we walked by. The service from when you set foot in the hallway, to when you enter the dining area, to when you are seated and taken care of through your meal, to when you leave - *chef's kiss*. We were seated one table away from the window, which was a bummer but still got to enjoy the beautiful view unobstructed for an hour or so. The food we ordered was outstanding - some standouts include the steak and bone marrow mashed potatoes (soooooo delectable, so umami); the three shells appetizer (so many different options! All so fresh!); and the surprise chocolate cake dessert with happy birthday written on it at the end. What a romantic way to spend a birthday, and what a way to enjoy a Michelin-star eating experience. Would love to come back to try lunch here sometime in the future.
Never thought I'd be writing a statement this lofty or ridiculous, but here we are: Never in all my years of going to nice restaurants, Michelin starred or otherwise, have I felt so disrespected.

Let's get the good part over with first, since the list is short; the foie gras duet was excellent, and enough for two. The view, if you are lucky enough to get window seats, is also excellent.

All the other dishes were sloppily executed; the duck was overcooked, the mushroom wellington underseasoned, and the dessert chestnut souffl√© -- on boy, texture of vomit. I could barely eat two spoonfuls. If you are going to put a souffl√© on your menu, Get. It. Right.

The most infuriating part of the whole experience is how quickly the waitstaff profiles guests. From the moment we stepped into the restaurant -- to celebrate our anniversary, no less -- we were treated as second class citizens because of how we looked; and don't get me wrong, we were dressed appropriately for the restaurant. The hostess didn't even bother with niceties (such as a simple smile) and had us wait unnecessarily at the bar for ~15 minutes even though we were on time for our reservation; we were seated at the back of the restaurant and if you looked around, everyone else in that section were Asian -- coincidence? The universe is rarely so lazy. Service was slow and haphazard, and it showed right down to the execution of the food.

But the crowning moment of all of this was when our server brought over our bill, looked at it, then sheepishly told us that she will take off the gratuity line they had sneakily included because they thought we were tourists. EXCUSE ME?! As a $$$$ establishment, you either go TIP FREE or you treat all your guests the same and allow them to make their own decisions; you DO NOT arbitrarily decide who looks like a tourist and who does not.

For shame, River Caf√©.
Celebrated my mother's birthday here. Service was excellent and we felt very well taken care of.

Wagyu steak tartare: absolutely delicious; would recommend 100%. I was a bit iffy trying raw beef but I'm glad I did!

Mushroom Wellington: it was good, but I don't really think it's worth the price just for mushrooms and what's ultimately a bread coating outside. I would recommend the lobster instead.

Brooklyn bridge cake: beautiful and the cake was delicious! However, I wish the chocolate they used for the bridge was milk instead of dark.

Overall, the experience was great and the restaurant itself looked amazing. The only thing I wasn't happy about was being charged $20 for 2 bottles of water. Also, the cobblestone in the driveway made it hard to walk in heels.
One of my fav restaurant in NYC, and I especially like the romantic restaurant which is decorated by flowers lol, also the dessert ""Brooklyn Bridge"" is definitely my fav one! hope the indoors dinning can open soon!!! Missing those cute restaurants so much!!!
This experience and food was on another level. This was actually the first Michelin star restaurant I've ever tried and I can see why it has one. I have tried almost every top restaurant in Atlanta (no Michelin stars in that city) and several New York restaurants. But this food just blew away everything else. New York is truly a foodie's dream. Everything in this city is delicious, and a Michelin restaurant in NYC has the highest expectations.

There were a few things that made this experience maybe more of a 4.25 or 4.5, but I have rounded up. What makes this restaurant is the incredible view, especially at night. We were seated not by the window, but next to a table by the window. Luckily, between guests at that table, we got some great shots of the incredible city and Brooklyn Bridge view.

FOOD:
There is a 3-course fixed price dinner (I believe there is a 6-course but this was already a lot of food!). You pick one from each category of appetizer, entree, and dessert. It also starts with an amuse bouche. It costs about $145 per person, so for 2 people, it was about $400 in total after tip, tax, and drinks. Insanely pricey but you are paying for the view/experience as well.

- Appetizer of Wagyu Steak Tartare: This was INCREDIBLE. The best part of dinner. I have always wanted to try steak tartare, but I have been scared. Raw beef is kind of intimidating. But what better place to try it than at a restaurant like this? It's hand-cut Kobe style beef with quail egg, cognac gelee, traditional garnish, and toast points. There's also the quail egg shell with salt in it to sprinkle. The server asks if you want them to mix it for you or if you want to do it yourself. It tasted so rich and buttery and almost like it had mayo in it, but it doesn't. The flavor of the steak is incredible and the acidity and saltiness of the toppings mix in so well with it. Bf got the scallop and pork belly appetizer and said it was good.

-Entree: I got the American Red Snapper. It came with a delicious brown butter lobster sauce that they poured on for me. There were also vegetables that were amazing with the sauce. The fish itself was well-seasoned with crispy skin. I don't like fish skin, but this tasted incredible and I ate every last bit of this dish. There was no element on this dish that was an afterthought. Everything was delicious on its own. Bf got the Niman Ranch Strip Steak medium-well, which I'm pretty sure you are not supposed to do at a high-end restaurant haha. So it was not super juicy but it was very flavorful. It came with the potato in the bone marrow and wow, that was unreal. Definitely the winner of the dish.

-Dessert: Obviously I had to get the Brooklyn Bridge chocolate dessert. It was very picture-worthy. I also love the little complimentary treats with dessert. They were all perfect. We were also asked if we wanted coffee and we assumed it was complimentary, but it was $7 for a small cup. That's very overpriced, but hey, if you're already spending $400, $7 is almost nothing added on top of it.

ENVIRONMENT:
The walkway to this restaurant is stunning. You walk in and they take your coat. I brought mine in with me, but keep in mind that you cannot hang it on the back of your seat. Definitely dress up for this place. Everyone was super formal and I felt a bit out of place. Suit jackets for the men and at least cocktail evening wear for the ladies. I wore a long sleeve dark-burgundy fitted dress with heeled ankle boots and I definitely felt like I should have worn a nicer-material dress and some heels. I was out all day though and we came straight here, so it was the best I could do in a pinch.

-There was an intimidating man who took our orders and I felt like he may have looked down on us for being so young. However, the rest of the servers were so amazing and accommodating. They brought me a small chair to keep my purse and a bag of shoes on. They also sweep away the crumbs on the table. Water was filled often. I really felt like the service was top notch.

-However, it was a slightly snobby atmosphere. I felt really embarrassed that I didn't have the best etiquette. Also the table next to us had two men who talked trash about everyone else in the restaurant. They were looking down on those who didn't wear a tie with their suit jacket and commenting on other people's etiquette/behavior and outfits. They definitely spoke like they come from a lot of money. Keep in mind that the tables are close together so you can likely hear conversations from other tables. I didn't mind the atmosphere as much later in, because I just focused on my food and experience!

-OVERALL, great experience, food, and view. Just don't let other people there taint your experience. Highly recommend if you have the $ to drop for this. It was very memorable.
Omg..  amazing would be an understatement.  Service was fantastic, food
Impeccable.  Beautiful location.  We opted for
The chef inspired offering..  oh my - yummy!  Definitely a splurge to eat at this establishment, but definitely with it!
Great place for a special occasion. From the moment you walk in, the service is 5 stars. The dining room is beautiful (view is a plus), the live piano takes the experience to a different level. I like how you choose appetizer and main course at once and they take care of the timing. Our dinner began with a complimentary amuse bouche (something with smoked trout...), which was beautifully plated. Then they brought out the bread selection (yum!) - I chose the fig and walnut and my husband chose the dinner roll, both very good and the butter was delicious at well.
For appetizers: gnudi with truffles - great winter  dish, having the truffles shaved in front of you is always fun.
Scallop with pork belly - you barely needed to chew any of those. Everything was so fresh and perfectly cooked.
We were very excited for the main course: steak with duchess potatoes - the steak was HUGE. Trust me, I can eat. It was an incredible piece of meat. The bone marrow potatoes were actually served inside a bone - great presentation. My husband went with the lamb, which melted in your mouth and was at a perfect temperature. We were both very satisfied with our choices.
Dessert: goat cheesecake - the guava sorbet was amazing. I loved how light the cheesecake was.
The second dessert was souffl√©. OMG! I had not had souffl√© in years, and this one was so good! It was a relatively ""simple"" flavor, with white chocolate, but it was so perfect. The pineapple ice cream added a fresh touch to it.
They also have great espresso. I also did not mind the extra sweets they brought out with coffee. Overall a great experience! Perfect spot for a romantic evening
The River Caf√© is a beautiful Brooklyn restaurant that sits right next to the water. It encompasses a nearby garden complete with cobblestone roads, and someone has taken care to tend the flowers and add fairy lights to the trees. The restaurant itself will remind you of a ship, and it has a very old-timey feel to it. The restaurant is beautiful during the daytime and nighttime. Guests are dressed really nicely; my date and I wore formal attire, and we saw a couple get turned away because they have a jacket policy. It's pretty unfortunate that this restaurant is named The River Caf√© because it doesn't bring up any feelings of elegance or glamour that the restaurant itself possess.

My friend and I showed up an hour before our reservation because we wanted to take pictures before it got dark. I was wearing heels, and if you're not someone who is an expert in them, I would probably recommend wearing a shorter pair or cute sandals instead. I almost tripped numerous times on the cobblestone paths. Service is great here. But what would you expect? If you're paying nearly $150 per person, great service is the least that you would expect.

I'm not too familiar with the history of The River Caf√© or how highly esteemed it is in the food industry, but some of the other reviewers here have enlightened me. My friend ordered the rabbit appetizer and seabass entree. I ordered the wagyu beef tartare and steak entree. The rabbit is probably the best appetizer I've ever had. I could eat 100 of the 21-layer rabbit lasagnas. The beef tartare was also delicious and intricately prepared. I personally don't really like steak so I'm not sure why I ordered it, but lucky for me, my friend prefers steak. We ended up switching entrees. The seabass was amazing. The skin was fried and crispy. The meat was delicate, buttery, and flavorful. The sauce they used was delicious in combination with the fish. We also ordered the souffl√© and cheesecake for dessert.

The experience here was one that I cherish and appreciate. It's a gorgeous restaurant, and the servers are kind and fast. However, the food isn't amazing. It's good, but it doesn't make you want to come back for anything specifically. It's a really romantic restaurant, and you can see the incredibly New York skyline from the inside.
I couldn't ask for a more beautiful view!!!

The ambiance, decor and view is insane and overlooking the Brooklyn bridge. This place is $$$$ but definitely worth the experience. They first took our drink orders and then we ordered food. What we didn't know is that we 1) each get our own appetizers 2) appetizer, entree and dessert was a set price (definitely fine just weren't aware pre visit and is helpful for others to know). First a women with a bread platter came by and asked which bread we would like. Then our appetizers came and I had the steak tartare which was really good and had a pleasant presentation. For my entree, I ordered the chicken which was good - but not great so that is the real reason I am giving this place a four. Lastly, I ordered the chocolate moose cake that was flavorful as well.

There was a pianist that added to the already perfect ambiance. I will be back, even if it it just for a drink at the cute little bar!

Excellent service too, but expected as we are spending quite a bit.
The setting is magical, the view of the city incredible, but the restaurant is the star. Food menu offers unusual options to suit every taste. The special skate first course was wonderful, as was the foi gras and the octopus. Duck entree was amazing as was the lobster. Lots of interesting combinations of delicate flavors. Service is really 5 star, from entry to exit. We were there on two chilly evenings but I can imagine that the garden in summer really sets a delightful mood. Ate here twice in one week with no disappointments.
This place has old school class.  They require a dinner coat as after 4 pm it is formal attire only.  It is a three-course prefixed menu with lots of variety per course.  My wife had the steak tartare while I had the rabbit. Both were delicious appetizers. Then I had the strip steak and my wife had the Lamb which were both perfectly cooked.  If you were looking for a great view of the Manhattan skyline along with the Brooklyn Bridge, this is your place.
After taking a mid-day walk from lower Manhattan across the Brooklyn Bridge we found this wonder! Beautiful views surrounded by lovely gardens! The food was smaller portions but excelled! The service was impeccable. I'll like to try it for dinner however I'm more of a casual diner. The desserts were to die for! The carrot margarita was perfect! The fois gras was also superb! You should not skip this experience!!!

Food was delicious but service was a huge downer. 2 things.

First, we had reservations at 6pm--fairly early to get a glimpse of the view while we eat our meal. The place was basically empty but the maitre d' sat us at the booth in the back where the sun glare was so strong. During the whole meal, a lot of window seats were empty.

Second, it's so disappointing to see that a Michelin star restaurant has servers who never smiles. I came with my boyfriend to celebrate our anniversary and I politely asked the server to take a photo for us. No response but a sigh as if we asked something so difficult. He didn't even bother checking up on us throughout our entire meal. We literally waited 20 min each for the entree and dessert to come out. Spent nearly 500 for a mediocre service with no view. I wouldn't come back here.
This restaurant has been on my bucket list for a while, and I'm so glad to have experienced it. Brought my family while they were visiting, and we were all so impressed, both by the restaurant and the gorgeous backdrop of the Manhattan skyline that you can see from every seat in the dining room.

The menu is all prix fixe, and we opted for the 3-course. Loved every single dish, and I don't think you can go wrong.

The vibe is pretty quiet/reserved, so just keep that in mind. Dress code is elegant, and you will stick out if you are under-dressed!
Too expensive to walk in so I took some nice pictures outside. This would be a cute wedding venue. It is such a pretty area to walk around. Maybe take a special someone here for an important dinner if you want to spend a lot of money
Some things in life are worth dressing up for, and a visit to the illustrious River Cafe is one of them.  Known around the world as a culinary destination, it's the most enchanted landmark eatery in the City and nestled under the Brooklyn Bridge.  Offering gorgeous views of Manhattan, the setting is boundlessly romantic.  However, they don't rest on their looks alone.

A prestigious roster of chef alums includes Charlie Palmer (Aureole, Crimson & Rye), David Burke (David Burke Kitchen) and Rick Moonen (RM, Oceana); ingredients have always been the finest available, and the kitchen team inherently understands what goes with what.  Succulent pork belly with scallops was a favorite until i discovered the glistening duck breast with sweet potato spatzle.

This restaurant may possibly be my all-time favorite. The words iconic and epic fall short in describing the experience.  If you've never been, make it a bucket list item!
Wow, just wow. This restaurant is everything I could have asked for. Great attention, accommodations, and the food was just spectacular. Every item brought out had a clear level of culinary thought that brought out distinct flavors. Though it is quite expensive, the most expensive meal I have ever had in New York thus far, I can honestly say it has been the best dining experience I have ever had. We ordered the scallops and pork belly as well as the roasted rabbit with lasagna appetizers. I ordered the steak and my date ordered the lamb. We both asked for the brooklyn bridge chocolate cake for dessert. Everything from start to finish was phenomenal. I honestly probably wouldn't order the roasted rabbit appetizer again, but otherwise I would order everything exactly the same. I would love to return some day.
Having lived in New York for over 3 decades, I used to carry around my Zagat (before there was Yelp) around New York looking for the best restaurants to dine at. The River Cafe was always on my list but I never got around to it. Life just got busy after moving to Jersey. As my husband and I celebrate our 25th, we thought it be wonderful to finally have the chance to dine at one of the most iconic and romantic restaurants in NYC with spectacular views overlooking the Brooklyn Bridge.

We made reservations for 5:30pm. It's best to arrive a little early, you can either sit at the bar or take a few photos outside the beautiful garden. Valet is complementary when dining here.

The restaurant was adorned with stunning holiday decor. Some tables had bouquets of beautiful roses. The restaurant is dimmed so picture taking is a bit tricky. A tiny cushioned ottoman is placed next to the table so women can place their purses.

We ordered from the prix-fixed dinner menu. Here is what we decided on:

Appetizers:
- Complimentary Amuse Bouche
- Sea Scallop & Pork Belly
- Wagyu Steak Tartare w/Quail Egg

Entrees:
- Lobster w/Corn Tamale
- Spice Crusted Duck Breast

Desserts:
- Chocolate Brooklyn Bridge
- Semifreddo
- Complimentary array of chocolates & macaron

We ordered a Tom Collins and a White Russian along with a bottle of sparkling water. Never once did we had to refill our water glasses, it was like there was someone standing behind me the whole time and they knew when to. The drinks were delicious and PERFECT!

It was such a delightful surprise to be served a small plate of Amuse Bouche before the apps came. We loved it and it made us excited for what was to come. When my husband's Wagyu Steak Tartare came, the server mixed all the ingredients on the plate together along with a quail egg. A side plate of toast points is served along with the tartare. It was absolutely delicious. Don't be afraid to get this dish. At the end of our meal, they presented our desserts with a Happy Anniversary sign on a piece of chocolate. Dare I say this? The dessert was my favorite part of the meal and I'm not even a huge dessert person. The Semifreddo (I'm still dreaming about it) was incredible. I didn't even want to give my husband a taste because that would mean less for me. The Semifreddo is a delicate yogurt served along with fresh pomegranate sorbet with roasted pistachio and sesame halvah. Heaven!!

This is a Michelin starred restaurant that has won numerous awards. The price you pay matches the level of meticulous and impeccable service you will receive here. The staff here is at the top of their game, probably the best we've ever experienced.

Thank you River Cafe for making our 25th memorable.
After our amazing dinner at a nearby steakhouse, my sister and I agreed to burn off the influx of calories into our system by walking on the Brooklyn Bridge. Alas, it started pouring and we had no choice but to think of an alternative.

My sister went online and found The River Cafe. She suggested having a post-dinner drink while savoring the view of the Brooklyn Bridge and East River.

Parking was by valet service only. The valet asked us if we had a dinner reservation and we said no. He told us to go up to the hostess and check if we could still be accommodated.

The lobby was tastefully and colorfully festooned with fragrant and fresh flowers and plants. There was a sign on the door leading to the dining room that advised men to wear a dinner jacket. Luckily, we were dressed nicely since we were celebrating my sister's birthday that day.

We told the hostess that we were there for drinks only and she found us a cozy corner table next to the piano and across from the bar. We had a picturesque view of the Brooklyn Bridge and East River. We also got to enjoy our drinks while listening to soothing piano music. The dining area was on the other side of the room. Drinks were not cheap but we both enjoyed our beverages. The maitre d' and all the servers were polite and accommodating. We were given the same amount of attention as the regular dinner patrons.

Overall, our visit to the River Cafe was a superb capper to a magical night in Brooklyn.
I loved it!!!! I went here on a Saturday at 2pm to have a fancy lunch. I made the reservation online and I received a call from a staff member 2 days before to confirm the reservation. I knew there was a dress code so I looked it up on their website to get an idea of what is acceptable. Their website stated ""Semi-casual,"" hm, does this sound helpful to you? It didn't for me so when she called me, I asked her specifically, can guys wear shorts? She said, ""no, no shorts at all."" I relayed this message to my bf and he showed up in long black pants. Needless to say, it was a hot day. We arrived a little early than 2pm and was greeted by the hostess. She told us to sit by the bar until our table was ready. I sat there, looked around, and what do I see? Gentlemen with shorts!! This is the only reason why I docked a star.

Drinks are super pricey here ($17+).

We were seated by the window (yay)! I had the sea scallop and pork belly as the appetizer and the niman steak as the main. Both were delicious and the portion for the main was actually more than I had imagined. We were also given complimentary treats and really appreciated that. I had noted that this lunch was to celebrate my birthday. After the main course, we were given a dessert menu and I ordered the ""Brooklyn Bridge."" It came nicely presented and had a ""Happy Birthday"" chocolate on it. Nice touch! The service was impeccable. No snobby attitude or rude behavior. I thought we would be ignored but they were actually very attentive to us.

It is pricey but the lunch is worth it. I'd recommend coming here to celebrate a special occasion.
This place is fantastic. I decided to make reservations for breakfast here and immediately fell in love with the location. The views are incredible! The food was no let down either. I ordered the chocolate hazelnut pancakes with bacon and a side of hash brown. I also ordered a Bellini to wash it all down. While the prices were a little steep; the service was exceptional and the food was amazing, couple that together with the fabulous views and you have got yourself an amazing experience. I can't even imagine how much more magical it is at night. Definitely a must see.
A beautiful venue but the management is really disappointing. My friend was ATTACKED by their pet cat. It has a collar and it's owned by the restaurant.

His legs had scratches and his pants were completely ruined. The tailor said there's no way to repair. When this matter was addressed to the management they didn't do anything about it and frankly acted like nothing happened. What a shame. This is a friend who paid for a wedding at this venue, you'd think they could simply apologize and fix the problem.

The main point to this review is to warn everyone of their poor customer service. Your not valued by this restaurant, if anything, taken advantage of.

Super sad to have not found a resolution with this restaurant.
I came here for one of my birthday meals while my family was in town and I was looking for a place that would have nice views for them.  We also generally tend to stay in manhattan so I thought it would be nice to take them to Brooklyn, though this is obviously just over the bridge.

Since I didn't pay for this meal, the cost factor didn't really impact me, but I will say that I don't think this is the best value prix fixe menu option out there.  It's quite pricey for only 3 dishes, I think it ends up being about $46 per dish and one of those is dessert.

That aside, I was also annoyed that you have to be a regular to get a table by the window, though the restaurant isn't that big so you can see out the windows from probably the entire reastuarant.  Our party of 5 apparently couldn't fit by the window anyways, but it's still annoying.  I probably wouldn't come back here to eat on my own so looks like I won't be sitting by the window anytime soon.

Those things aside, the service was very good and attentive throughout the evening and the food was very tasty, with some highlights and some items I thought could be better.

The foie gras was good, but I much preferred the mousse in the jar to the terrine which had a weird film like outer layer that I did not care for.

The lobster was tasty but I did not like the flavor profile of the corn tamale, I just don't think it goes that well with lobster and it lowered the dish in my book.

For dessert since it was my birthday I upgraded to the tawny tasting since I love tawny and it came with 3 different bites to complement each wine.

My fianc√© got the classic Brooklyn bridge dessert, which was adorable and he enjoyed it especially since it was gluten free!

Like I said, since I wasn't paying it's probably 4-4.5 stars for me, but if I were paying I just don't think the value is there compared to other restaurants in this price point.  We'll see if I come back in the future.
If I could leave less than a one star review I would. My partner made a reservation for us to celebrate our engagement here. On our way to the restaurant we got caught in the rain so we dropped our blazers off and called the restaurant to make sure that it would be fine for us to dine without our jackets. The woman on the phone assured us it would be fine.

Upon arriving at the restaurant we were treated with more disrespect than I have ever felt from any restaurant. Ever. The doorman didn't greet us, he just asked us if we had a reservation. He didn't even open the door.

When we entered, (the empty cafe) the hostess would not seat us because we were wet. We informed her we had called ahead and were told it would fine, but she didn't even go speak to someone else. She simply made us leave.

The deep unkindness with which we were met speaks volumes about this establishment. No number of Michelin stars, no food, no matter how delicious, is worth the disrespect we felt upon stepping foot in the river cafe. Save your money. Eat elsewhere.

Looking forward to returning here very soon

The Turkish Eggs had incredible flavor - the dish itself is beautifully displayed and is accompanied by 4 pieces of toasted bread for dipping. This was by far the standout of the meal - it was outstanding and could have easily eaten two servings of this. The Cacio e Pepe got a thumbs up from my friend.

The Bloody Mary was eh... and not as described on the menu, aka - it was missing some stuff. Very average and could have used more flavor - aside from ONE piece of lemon, there were no garnishes to be found anywhere; no olive, no celery no flavored rim, etc. Give that cocktail some TLC! After that, I switched to the Last Word, which was a better choice. The Chili Margarita was also tasty and their iced coffee had some strength to it -  it's served in a pint glass.

When we sat down, I overheard one of the staff speaking with a customer about this being their first day open for brunch and it's not yet been advertised just yet, however, they have been open for dinner.

The overall experience was good and the vibe was right. Yes, I'd go back but for dinner.
I have ordered Turkish egg I must say the food quality was good unfortunately thats the only good thing I can say about the place.

Slow service took them over 45 min to serve our food when the place was far of being full.
The portion are super small and expensive.
Luckily, Colonie has stayed open though the beginning of the Covid craziness. I came by on a Saturday for brunch with a friend.

We had the entire bar-like table under the living wall all to ourselves. I ordered a hot coffee (French press) and a blood orange chili margarita. The French press coffee was SO delicious. But - it barely filled my mug and I wish there was a bit more coffee. The margarita was super delicious and I wholeheartedly recommend.

My friend and I shared a bunch of plates - the cacio e pepe scramble, the Turkish eggs, the biscuits, and the home fries with aioli. The star of all of this was definitely the Turkish eggs. Everything about this dish is delicious and it's a must order. The cacio e Pepe was a perfect soft scramble and a really delicious dish and for someone wanting perfect simple eggs. The aioli in the home friends had a very intense orange flavor which was just ok for me. The biscuits were stunning, but the flavor was a little too eggy for me. I loved the preserves, and the orange zest really worked.

The Turkish eggs are an absolute must with the cacio e Pepe scramble coming in as a close second. I need to get back and try those doughnuts!
i was here five years ago and I passed by it recently wanting to try it again. We didn't end up getting a lot of food just an appetizer and some wine because the timing was tough.

The server couldn't of been nicer she let us drive all the lines we wanted to before we decided on which one was right. She was helpful and I wish I got her name so I could shower her out here but she has curly hair and was super sweet.
The five stars is for the mushroom pate. Make sure you eat it with the Meyer lemon slice (don't take it off). One of the best things I've eaten this year and I've had a lot of tasty items this year. I also loved and would get the Turkish eggs (who knew yogurt would be a winning combo with chili oil and eggs) again and again - if only this place was closer to me and didn't require a wait! Would rinse/repeat these two items till I got sick of them.

The pancake is unique - more of a cake to be honest. It was tasty but not what I was looking for. I prefer my pancakes flatter and more dense....coffee is also pretty meh. Get cold brew bc hot coffee - despite being served in a cute French press - was not enjoyable (pretty sour/acidic...too much so for me even with milk added).
Brunch review only!

We came here on a Sunday around 12:30 and didn't have trouble finding a spot for the 2 of us. We sat at the open kitchen, which was great to see all the dishes being made! Also helped in our decision making since most of the pictures on Yelp were for dinner.

We ended up getting the cherry salad, turkish eggs, oysters, and donuts.
- Cherry salad: very light and refreshing with prosciutto, manchego and mint! The cherries are a bit tart but still refreshing and sweet! It paired really well the cheese and prosciutto. I thought this was a good combo to the heavier egg dish we shared
- Turkish eggs: my first time trying this! It's basically poached eggs, yogurt, and brown butter sauce with fresh dill and spices! SO good! It comes with a side of freshly fired bread. Mix it all up, dip your bread in, and hellooo flavors! We liked it so much, we were inspired to make it at home!
- Donuts: we were immediately tempted to get this when we saw it on the menu. The donuts are more on the cakey side, so don't expect airy/fluffy. But flavors are bomb. It also comes with this creamy light lemon sauce that I couldn't stop eating!

I'm glad we ended up coming here because I was a littttle skeptical when I first saw the menu and wasn't that impressed. But I was so surprised and can't wait to return!
Pesto Bianco...is..back people

If you know anything about Brooklyn heights, you know there are several restaurants in a 4 block radius and many of which are your general Thai, Mediterranean, or Sushi restaurants. If you live here, you also know how difficult it is to get your Manhattan friends to make the journey. I'm happy to announce Colonie is golden ticket we've all been waiting for.

Firstly, sit at the chefs table. Watching the chefs work their magic is incredible (shout out to Kone (sp) on the pasta. They put so much TLC in their food it really is a treat to watch. All of their drinks are delicious, I especially favor the detox retox, and cuc cocktail.

The apps are also fantastic I would recommend 1 per person. Everything is fantastic, esp the sweet potatoes, Brussels (shaved and light not fried) and sunchokes.

For dinner- get the spaghettoni. The pesto blanco is almond based and has a spicy after taste. I could eat this for every meal for the rest of my life. It can be made vegan or they can make it into a cheesy delight of that's what you're into.

Everything here is A++++, but just expect a $100 for a party
TOP TEN BRUNCH SPOTS IN BK...I've been coming to Colonie for years for breakfast. Their food has always been consistently delicious. Their ambience gets 5 out of 5 stars as well. I always opt to sit at the ""bar"". I love an open concept kitchen. Literally everything is good here. Always come with a big appetite and a few ppl so you can order everything and share. Customer service is always on point. A true gem of Atlantic Avenue, nestled in the back of the main road of the Barclays Center,  walking distance to Brooklyn Bridge Park.
It's been a while since I wrote a review but I just wrapped up dinner at Colonie and the experience was so fantastic that I couldn't not write one!

Colonie had the trifecta that I'm always looking for --amazing service, food and ambience! From the minute we walked in the host was so warm and welcoming. I was holding flowers and a wet umbrella but needed to run to the restroom and he took both from me while I did that. He was willing to seat me while we waited for the rest of my party (I love when restaurant s don't make you wait for everyone even if you have a reservation). The service continued to be fantastic throughout the meal-- our server was also really nice, gave good recommendations and didn't rush us. The team of servers supporting our table was attentive and quickly took away plates, changed out silverware, etc. and overall worked seamlessly together.

Next was the food; we ordered the crudo, burrata, cauliflower, lamb belly, pork chops, and artic char. For desert we had the blueberry sorbet and the sticky date cake. EVERYTHING  was beautifully presented, light and flavorful. Standouts include the burrata which came with charred bread and to my surprise the char went perfectly with the light burrata and it's shaved pickled celery. The lamb belly is a MUST GET, pressed into a square shape like pork belly and crisped on the outside with a mint sauce drizzle it was so flavorful. My husband got it and I was jealous! The cauliflower was also so flavorful-- it came with fresh mint, a mint sauce, pomegranate and fried shallots. The sticky date dessert was amazing -- warm, sweet came paired with ice cream! I wanted a second order of it! My artic char was cooked perfectly. The crudo was light but had a little too much fresh oregano for me.

For ambience, the venue is nicely decorated, not overly done, dark wood, plants and clean. Whoever was in charge of music, they get a thumbs up! The music was a great mix of oldies, r&b and a little lover's rock. Great vibe! The team was also diverse from the chefs to the servers and I appreciated that.

They are open late too which will make this one of my new go to spots for date night!
Been here twice for brunch and blown away each time.  Donuts and monkey bread go well with French press coffee to start. Ricotta is smooth and lemony - goes well with toasted bread!  Shrimp and grits always good. Turkish eggs truly unique and flavorful!  Sunchokes are potatoes make for good sides!

Best of all - we got to sit at one of the corner tables in the front for a sun drenched brunch!
I love brunch spots like this. Warm and chill vibe, with amazing food.

The scramble was so good, blended with different cheeses and lightly cooked. Potatoes were a bit tangy, with crispy skin and the perfect seasoning.

That date cake was literally the best thing I've had the last month. Moist, warm, and a perfect balance of flavor between dates and the melted caramel on it. The ice cream really topped it off.

I have nothing but compliments for Colonie and wish I had discovered it earlier. Definitely my new neighborhood favorite. 5 stars from me
It was a little difficult getting a reservation at Colonie. We made a reservation about a week in advance and got a reservation for 9:30pm on a Saturday night. Even with a reservation, we still had to wait 15-20 minutes for our table to be ready.

We started out with some drinks. I had the ""Cool Hand Cuke,"" a cucumber and elderflower drink. It was sweet (but not too sweet). I love cucumber in drinks and was not disappointed. For food, the cauliflower dish and snapper crudo caught my eye. Was a little disappointed with the cauliflower dish. There was nothing special about the flavors in the dish and it was too salty for me. However, I LOVED the snapper crudo. The flavor from the coconut milk was so interesting and suited the fish perfectly. It was definitely a novel taste to me and so delicious. Would strongly recommend the snapper crudo.

Colonie has fabulous food, terrific servers, wonderful ambience and is allergen friendly! I love eating there as it's excellent food and safe for me to eat.
We did not have reservations but for a group of 3 we were able to grab a seat along the side bar. Our waiter was very friendly and was very knowledge about the menu.

We started with the buttermilk biscuits that came with jam and butter. The jam was sooooooo good. Wow. I thiiiink it was blackberry jam. It was delicious with the biscuits. They were warm and very dense. The outside top part was slightly flakey. Look, just get it. You're welcome.

Two of us got the Turkish Eggs and it was such a nice change from what I normally get when I go to brunch. The poached eggs were nice and runny. It sits on top of some Turkish yogurt covered in oil. You can see and taste the chili peppers and garlic and it will linger so maybe have a gum after lol. But it's totally worth it.  It also comes with a side of bread you can dip in there and eat with the eggs. My only issue with the bread was the taste of ash.

The Burrata was also delicious and worth trying.

I think this is cool spot to visit for brunch.
Cute local neighborhood bar with strong drinks and good dessert. The sticky date cake is a must! I'm a very picky eater and not really the one to try new things but this cake was delicious it tasted like chocolate cake but better. Great service and good vibes. Will definitely return
I came here for a brunch during the weekend and overall had an ok experience. They do not take reservations so we were waiting by the door a little before opening time and was able to get the table.

Here is the breakdown

Food

The food was ok in my books, very elaborated plates but the flavor factor wasn't there at least for my palette. I ordered the duck confit hash and the house potatoes. My friend ordered the biscuit sandwich-- the biscuit was delicious.

Decor/ Ambiance

Nice, cutesy rustic modern look. We seat at the chef's table and it was very nice to see them prepare the dishes right in front of you. Nice and lively house music.

Service

The waiters were friendly. It was busy and they were training their best to be as attentive as they could.

Overall

Had an ok experience. Great vibe, the food was just not for me. But it might be for you, so still try it.
The ambiance and food was tasty. The service was great. The food presentation was just as you see on a food show. I ordered the lamb & eggs which was delicious. It reminded me more of a dish I would eat in the fall though - it reminded me of a chilli. There were many chunks of lamb and the sauce was quite yummy. I sampled my friends shrimp & grits, which I liked as well. It was adorned with huge gulf shrimp and mushroom garnish. She also ordered a side of sausage - personal favorite! The cava was perfect. The Coffee & Cigarettes was just ok to me. It is an ideal blend of tequila and coffee, but not the taste I was shooting for. The table next to me ordered the pancakes, which look like a big cake (I thought it was a desert). I would definitely try them next time and share because it's massive.
Really impressed by the food here. We got the corn with goat milk butter  for appetizer and it was very tasty. For main we got the blue crab pasta and the simple spaghetti. The spaghetti is like the cheapest pasta on the menu but it was absolutely stunning. The pasta is very thick and chewy and the sauce with almond and lemon with a hint of spiciness was just perfect. Also got the sticky date cake for dessert. Now I'm trying to make a date cake myself too... Love this neighborhood jam!
So awesome! Went for brunch and the Turkish eggs and donuts with lemon cream were as good as it gets. Cool vibe and good service, though the chef does not do substitutions. Wheelchair accessible entrance and restroom.
Came here for brunch with a friend who recently moved to Brooklyn Heights. Luckily they were able to fit us in for brunch without a reservation. Very cool vibe with exposed brick and hanging vines on the walls -- very Brooklyn.

I had the Lamb and Eggs, which were spicy and delicious.  The lamb was tender and spicy, the white beans were creamy and melt in your mouth, nice texture from the bread crumbs and the creamy yolk from the egg tied the whole thing together. Yum! My friend has the Turkish Eggs which were also super tasty. The yogurt, brown butter and chiles were great to sip up with bread...of your fingers ha. And, of course, the meal couldn't be complete without the Warm Doughnuts, which were heavenly. The lemon cream was so good! The Bloody Mary and Bloody Caesar were both great.

Really nice place, with kitchen at sight

We had the pancakes and the turkish eggs, both delicious.

Staff was also very attentive
I have eaten brunch here twice and have enjoyed both visits very much. The first time we came, we waited at the door for the figurative opening bell to ring and we scored 2 seats at the chefs counter!  This is the place to sit if you want a unique experience. We watched the chefs prepare, cook, dress and plate the dishes. It was pretty cool, (except that 1 chef who tasted the food and put his used spoon back into the dish for a 2nd taste) (I wonder how often that happens)?

Yesterday we had brunch at the bar. We had an incredible feast. Ricotta toast, 5 cheese and 5 meat board, lamb and eggs, Turkish eggs and a Bison burger with fried egg. I also had a couple of Bloody Mary's which  were pretty pedestrian for such an inventive restaurant.

Nonetheless, I am a fan!
Honest to God knock me out. Been coming here for 2 years and no lie this place is amazing. They have NEVER disappointed. Pictured: Bone In Pork Chop
Cute little brunch spot in Brooklyn heights. Good vibes and great service! I ordered the Turkish eggs. I didn't really know what to expect after seeing brown butter and sweet chili in the ingredients, but it was actually very flavorful and delicious! Highly recommend.
Wow, now one of my top five restaurants. I was floored by everything served and the service is amazing. This is a need to go place and sit at the chef's counter.
Ended up here for the oyster happy hour, stayed for a full dinner.
Drinks - Cool Hand Cuke (not on the menu but ask for it anyway)
Oysters - yum
Mushroom Pate - delicious, but a bit too rich for me. Order extra bread and spread it out.
Sunchokes - this was soooo good. Must Have!! I definitely licked the plate clean
For dessert I went with the donuts, fun and yummy, not too sweet. Next time I'll try the sticky date cake :)
Come to Colonie for the cocktails and cheese plates and skip the long sit down dinner for someplace else. The main dinner options on the menu are just nothing special and I always leave somewhat disappointed in what I had ordered (this latest time Arctic Char for me and Bison Burger for husband both of which were OK but just OK). The cheese plate after dinner though left me salivating for more. Next time I'll just sit at the bar with one or two of those and go down the menu of their fabulous cocktails and wines.
Went here for Brunch! The menu was very eclectic. It was very hard to make a decision on what to order. The monkey bread is a must eat. I had the scramble, which was good, not really hard to mess up. My friend had the shrimp and grits, looked amazing and my dad had the pancakes, which when served don't really look like pancakes, but taste delicious. The only negative would be the kitchen backup, I understand the place was busy but orders were backed up and I didn't see much communication between the chef and main wait-staff. Overall, it was a delicious brunch. Would love to try this place for dinner.
Had a great meal at Colonie a few weeks ago. Sat at the chefs table and was an amazing experience watching the staffs rhythm in the kitchen. Head Chef Jared was very busy but still had time to make some excellent recommendations. Mushroom Pate, Octopus, Campanelle and Duck were all great. One word for Jared and his crew, Elite.
Ate her twice.  Once at the raw bar and then ""in the window"" seat area.   Like the happy hour seafood platter. Mignonette for oysters a bit too clawing.
Added cherry salad and mushroom pate the second time.  Filling meal.  We had skipped lunch that day.  Friends had lamb belly and spaghetti dish.  All looked good.  With bottle of wine etc tab over $200 for four.  No dessert or tons of food.    Atmosphere A+.
OMG the Turkish eggs!!

This restaurant is very cute and aesthetically pleasing. With a large welcoming bar in front and plenary of seating in the back surrounded by a living ""wall"" and plants visible though the windows, Colonie makes you feel like you're dining in a more rustic area, rather than Atlantic street in Brooklyn.

Then menu offers many items I definitely would like to come back to try but on advice from our neighbors went with the Turkish eggs. I'm so glad we did.

After we ordered them breakfast arrived in what seemed an impossible quick time. (Im talking like cooking show chef puts unbaked item in a stove and immediately opens another one to reveal baked item- fast) the Turkish eggs were amazing! In a time where everything seems to have the same flavor Turkish eggs offered me something I've never tasted before. They were a little spicy but not overpowering so. The eggs were picked perfectly.

I can't wait to come back and try their other tasty items.
This is the most delicious brunch spot in BK heights. Nice lighting near the front bar and windows and a bit dimmer in the back. Cute for a date or just a solo outing. The Turkish eggs are a must order. Poached eggs over yogurt and a chili oil. Service is quick and friendly! A must try in the area!
Never really made it I in, we went there because of all the reviews.  We walked in, waited a few minutes, none of the staff acknowledged us, from the bar tender that tha t was at the front door to the rest of the staff that all saw us and gave us the once look over.  Finally one person in our group walked in looking for the hostess, found her, no smiles, no greetings.  We were all professionals in our mid to late 30s.  As far as I am concerned I don't even care to try the food, they can keep it and do a basic brush over on hospitality because it was lacking.
Cute little place. Went here for bunch on a Saturday with my friend. Got there at 1 and didn't have to wait. Waitress was very friendly, kept refilling our water and didn't care that we talked for another half hour after she gave us the bill. Didn't feel rushed.

Food and drinks are expensive (normal for the area though) and high quality. We both had the Turkish eggs and they were great. Unique combination of spices and the yogurt and bread that went with it cooled the spicyness. Really good dish. Had a mimosa also, tasted mostly like orange juice but it was definitely freshly squeezed.

I recommend for brunch to catch up with a friend! I want to go back and try dinner.
This place is best known for brunch, but the winning move is to go for dinner, when it's not nearly as crowded and, quite frankly, a better deal (brunch food is generally overpriced everywhere for what you get).

Sitting at the counter is a real treat -- you get the watch the cooks do their thing and it's always fun to watch an excellent craftsman work.
One of Atlantic's best eatery's

Get the lamb belly or anything on the menu
For that fact.
My god, the Turkish Eggs are maybe the most perfect food item ever?  I never want to go to brunch anywhere else. (I actually don't think I have gone anywhere else since discovering Colonie.).

The pancakes are fun and yummy, but can't overcome how good the Turkish Eggs are to be #1. The cocktails are also delicious--I specifically liked the Detox Retox.

Cute atmosphere, too. Colonie's got it all!
One of the best brunch in Brooklyn.
Beautiful open kitchen, we were sitting at the chefs counter and the staff was friendly and very professional.
Super disappointing. The chef does not make any changes for folks with allergies. The waiter said he used to but no longer does. We were served burnt toast with the charcuterie. We sent it back because it was literally inedible and they brought out more burnt toast. The greens that came with the pork were also burnt, as was the bun on the burger. When we shared our concerns with the waiter, he said that the chef likes to make things chaThere's a difference between grilled and burnt and the chef was not nailing it. The fennel salad & the pasta we had were good. Just generally a bad energy -- seems like the chef likes to do things his way instead of listening to customers.

I ordered a few things for pickup and was thoroughly impressed with everything. The arugula salad with French balsamic was simple but absolutely delicious, and the proportions were more than generous. The beet salad with goat cheese was refreshing, and the mushroom croquettes were crispy and flavorful despite my taking a fair amount of time to actually eat them once picked up. I generally add salt to everything, but all of the dishes I received came perfectly seasoned. Can't wait to come back for table service and a cocktail.
Very happy to finally visit this place! Their burger is beyond exceptional. My partner got a steak and had food envy after having a bite of it. He said the steak wasn't really that great to begin with. The service here is as good as their burger. I'll come back for sure. Maybe tomorrow. Probably not that soon because I'll still be digesting this burger but it's gonna happen
Wish there were more cute / low key French bistro like Chez Moi in NYC ! Unpretentious and effortlessly chic -  outdoor seating, tents, string light. Just missing the accordion performers, almost Paris ;)

Food was typical bistro fair, e.g. mule frites , steak tartar , fish (mostly NY local), roasted chicken. We ordered exactly what we craved for - mules and frites! Two pounds worth of mussels soaked in buttery shallot rosemary whitewine sauce. Tasted just like what I had at the cute bistro in Montmartre, Pairs. Paired with a crispy un-oaked Macon villages chardonnay, golden. The grilled octopus was nice flavor tho a bit burnt and the sauce a tad too heavy .

All in all, this place is a gem!
I'm so happy this restaurant was open during COVID-19. After striking out on a couple of other spots we were seated in under 30 minutes on a busy Friday night.

We started off with a glass of Sancerre. Excellent wine, nice and crisp.

Next up we had the mussels and risotto. Both were delicious. I loved the risotto as it had a little kale in it which I thought was fun and unique!

Last but not least we had the chocolate mousse and creme br√ªl√©e for dessert. The chocolate mousse was easily the best I've ever had. Licked it clean.

Super friendly wait staff and great service. Amazing desserts!
We've dined at this French bistro several times this past year.  With its charming and rustic interior, Chez Moi is the kind of place you visit for the ambiance.  While the food and drink are fantastic, unfortunately the table service leaves a lot to be desired.  Since this restaurant is in our neighborhood and we enjoy the food, it's a worthwhile experience.

Here are some (hopefully organized) thoughts on our meals:
- The seafood is excellent.  I recommend everything from the $1 Oysters to the Tuna Tartare to the Mussels and Wild Skate Fish.  The seafood is fresh, well-prepared, and tasty.
- The DIY Charcuterie or Country Pate are a great way to start off your meal... although the bread is so-so TBH.
- Skip the Steak, get the Frites!  The Steak isn't terrible, but it tastes like its priced ($27).  Stick to the seafood!
- The cocktails are well-made.  The basement speakeasy is a neat way to kick off or wind down your evening.

Cheers!
This place is fantastic!  The food is good and wait staff are friendly- kid friendly as well! We started off with croquettes which was great then ordered mussels, steak frites and duck breast. The duck breast was the best - crispy skin, juicy fat and tender meat! I got it medium raw. However the dish could do with better sides to compliment the duck! Cherry reduction perhapss?

The steak amazingly tender but I havent been to a french bistro that has screwed up steak! The mussels were a hit with the kids!  We ordered desserts and the portions were massive! The profiteroles were the sizes if baby fists ans double ice cream - on top and inside!  The creme br√ªl√©e was huge! Overrall  attentive, patient wait staff and amazing food - I am very happy :)
Chez Moi is the rare New York French restaurant that serves French food.

The experience is excellent, and consistent in a warm, service- forward atmosphere. This also comes at extremely, well-priced value.

What I mean by French food, versus other French restaurants,  is that it's not a weak facsimile of touristy, Parisian bistro food. Rather, its food has the flavor, textures, and delicacy of the food of France.

I had been to the restaurant years ago, but I came to appreciate it more since my recent trips to French cities outside of Paris with Dijon, Lyon, and Bordeaux coming to mind readily having tasted this food days after returning from Dijon.
I'm on the fence about this place between 3 and 4 stars.

We shared a brunch at the bar with the chicken sandwich and fries.

The fries were some of the cleanest and best I've ever had.  So good in fact, I had almost finished them by the time the ketchup arrived that I asked for 10 minutes ago.

I like it when the order comes, already cut and split on separate plates when you tell them you're sharing.   The chicken sandwich was pretty darn good too, but the portion was just ok. (even if whole)

I love the ambiance but wife isn't a fan of French wooden bar stools.  I say they cradle my butt nicely.  To each his/her own.

It's those drink prices that kick the bill into high gear.  If you're having 2 drinks each, and sharing, you're still looking at $80+ tip.  In the world of sustainability, I don't find that sustainable.  If you're rolling in it...or bypass the booze, I'd recommend it in a minute.   Otherwise, keep strolling Atlantic avenue.
A lovely Bistro in the heart of Brooklyn heights with delish food and good Service. We shared several appetizers which were all yummy my favorite was Smoked Salmon with Creme Fra√Æche, Capers. The smoke salmon as this gal from Brooklyn would call lox was excellent cultivated perfectly with a nice soft oily texture. The oysters where my second favorite starter very creamy just awesome.

My main dish Skate fish over pur√©e lima Beans, with veggies. The fish tender flaky and the veggies medley was flavored perfectly. My favorite phrase To describe my feeing I had a fun party in my mouth.

My dessert was incredible, cream Brul√©  perfecto yes another grand party in my mouth.

I will for sure go back to restaurant bravo my friends. Oui oui.
We are visiting from Reno, NV and were told about Chez Moi.  We had a delightful time.  The food was outstanding as well as the service.  I am always astounded at places such as this.  A wonderful gem with a little hidden attitude.
Make sure you find the secret entrance to the amazing craft cocktail bar downstairs.  Very fun to look for and find.  Craft cocktails can be a little stuffy however on this night it was not busy and our cocktail virtuoso delighted us in drink and conversation.
Go take a look and enjoy good food and wondrous decor.
I live in the area and one of my neighbors recommended this place many times. To be very honest, with so many pizza places I often choose that over French food. Don't be like me!
We came here for dinner. First of all, the decor is very beautiful and it felt cozy with the dim lights. We did not have a reservation, but, luckily, someone who did was late or didn't show up. I recommend making a reservation since there are only a few tables (maybe 12?). We were seated promptly and ordered some drinks. The Basilic was a great one - I love when coconut is so nicely incorporated into a drink. I had the Chez Moi, which felt pretty watered down, although the idea was good.
We were asked by the waiter to order everything at once so they time everything in the kitchen. For starters: french onion soup, charred octopus and cheese board. The french onion soup was the star: I loved how everything was balanced. The octopus had a somewhat rubbery texture and the hazelnuts/chickpeas did not really make a lot of sense there in our opinion. The cheese board was good, but the cheeses felt like they were just taken out of the fridge.
For mains: moules frites (with Proven√ßal sauce), steak tartar and lamb shank. I tried the sauce in the mussels and it was delicious.
The steak tartar was very flavorful and fresh as well. Amazing french fries!!
The lamb shank was HUGE! It took no effort to take the meat off the bone. The couscous tasted off. The vegetables were simple but cooked correctly.
The prices were great considering the amount of food ordered. The main courses come in satisfying portions. I think this place is a good option in the neighborhood.
I was in the area mid-week and heard they had $1 oysters so had to stop by.  Had a dozen and they were very good and so ordered another dozen.  I then decided to just have dinner there so ordered mussels  and fries with the marniere - very tasty broth and quite a bit of garlic which I love.  The place definitely has a french bistro look and feel to it with french speaking staff.  A little bit of Paris in Brooklyn. Will be back.
Delicious food and incredible service! Vanessa was such a pleasure to have as our server. Though we came at the latest hour, she had so much good energy. The escargot and the French soup were my favorite! The lamb was so soft and fell off the bone right away. Thank you!
Pretty good French food. We were able to get seated on a Monday night at 8PM without a reservation.

We ordered escargot ($13) and pate ($11) to start. For entree, I got the duck breast ($28). The escargot doesn't come with shell but was very tender. Ask for some house bread to soak up the tasty oil and brine. I also really like the duck breast - a texture that almost melts in your mouth.

Docked a star for the pate (which was subpar; I wouldn't recommend) and the pricing. It's pretty standard for the area, but entrees are in the mid-$20s and are pretty small.
Love this place! They were able to accommodate me and my husband on a Saturday evening without having a reservation. The food was superb and didn't take long to come out at all. I was ready to have seconds of everything it was all so good. Cant wait to be back!
Always a go to for this neighborhood. Fantastic service for one. The food is always top notch. The escargot is fantastic, always a treat, just so, so good. I usually go with the skate, comes with some nice veggies and mashed potatoes. This time I was enticed by the fish special which was some fish, shrimp, mussels, fingerling potato and zucchini in a kind of light curry sauce. All delicious, just beautifully cooked. My buddy always goes for the salmon or chicken, with the salmon being his favorite. Good wine and a really nice chocolate mousse for dessert!
What a little gem! Last minute devision resulted in myself my husband and our friend going there for dinner. The ambience is really nice and romantic I would say. Perfect spot for a date. We ordered fois gras, croquettes, minestrone to start with followed by chicken and muscles which were very tasty. Food is nicely presented too! Our waitress was friendly and attentive. We shall be back!
Right on the edge of Brooklyn Heights, this french like restaurant really delivers. Very friendly, seats you quickly (with reservations), and works to deliver what you desire.

We really enjoyed the oysters, especially during happy hour prices. The escargot is absolutely amazing. The ""steak and frites"" were our hosts favorites, and ordering them once, we agreed. During our three weeks visit, we went here at least four times - and they recognized us quickly.

Great place, great food.
French food without the pretentiously tiny portion size or brouhaha in presentation and design - what more could I ask for?

Chez Moi is immediately inviting and warm on a winter's night, illuminated by dim and intimate lighting, and featuring a small but comfy space for you to enjoy your food. My friend and I got here around 7:30 on a Saturday night so we ended up sitting at the bar, which was perfectly fine because for once, this was a bar with seating that was adequately spaced out so you weren't elbowing the people next to you every five seconds.

I ordered the Jolie (absolutely delicious, a little sip of heaven) and the burger, which was excellently prepared and paired with a humongous pile of fries and a well-seasoned salad. The service was a little slow but it was a busy night and the bartender was doing His Best.

The food here is really, really excellent and I'm excited to have found another gem in this excellent neighborhood.
Great ambiance Great service GREAT DRINKS, you'll like everything. We had the salmon, duck breast, gazpacho, escargot, sorbet, and cr√®me br√ªl√©e and we had no complaints.
A hidden gem I walked into at Cobble Hill! The service and atmosphere was great and welcoming. Staff was attentive and kind. Their cocktails are really good. I wasn't that hungry, so I had steak frites and oysters! Delicious mixed oysters with fresh lemons. I came with a group and had no issues, after the light dinner we moved down to the actual hidden gem downstairs of Chez Moi. The ambience is dim lit and cozy both upstairs and down at Le Boudoir. I'll be back to try more from their menu.
Overall ****

Decor/ambiance *****
Small cute french restaurant, nice decor and cozy place with full bar.
Especial $1 oysters

Food *****
Had the seared duck breast with farro and orange sauce. It was absolutely delicious. Duck was perfect medium rare with crispy skin and not too fat. Laying in a bed of farro perfectly cooked, soaked in a delicious and fragant sauce, the orange gastrique was amazing.
Market fish of the night was cod. A bed od cod with potatos combined with a white sauce and top with crispy crambles. Very unique dish. Totally recommended.
Garlic and parmesan french fries. These were ok the garlic sauce made them too oily. You can survive without these.

Dessert **
Creme brulee was disappointing. It was very creamy, which in most cases is good but this creaminess was weird. It tastes like butter, greasy and unpleasant. It definitely didn't tasted like classic creme brulee. The sugar on top was perfect though. A bit burned but not too much.

Drinks***
These were kind of disappointing too.  I had order the chez moi especial before checking the review. When someone said do not recommend. Please listen to them!

Service****
Service was good. Our waitress was very courteous and attentive.
I've been for brunch multiple times and it's always good.  Feels like a little place you would find in France.  Quaint, casual vibe and tasty, no-fuss cooking.  The crepes are great!  Would like to try for dinner as well.
First I got a water glass with a lipstick stain on it, then when I asked if they served oysters on the weekend (not particularly wanting brunch at that moment), learned that they ONLY serve them during the week days, and apparently only when they have the $1 offer. I suspect I'd have a totally different experience if I came for brunch.

I opted for a cocktail instead and got the Chez Moi, which was excellent. But opted to venture elsewhere to cure my seafood craving.
Reservations for four people were made for 9 o'clock.  After 40 minutes of waiting for service and repeatedly asking the hostess for a waiter, we got up and left.  As we exited, the hostess and all the ""staff"" just shook their heads with a mumbled ""sorry.""  Never ever had we had such a shameful experience in a New York restaurant.  I sincerely hope the owner of the establishment is reading this review.
A 3 is average right?  It wasn't great, it wasn't terrible, it was fine.  That is how I would describe my meal at Chez Moi.

I ordered the steak and frites and my partner order the skate.  What made each dish fine and not delicious?  Everything was one noted, I guess you could say.  The one note was salt and luckily it wasn't over salted but a second note of herbs or fat or something to make it more than a boring piece of steak would have really made this a 4+ star dining experience.  My partners dish was more or less a piece of fish and potatoes.  There was no magic on the plate.  No wonderful layers of acid and fat and fun dancing together, just fish and mashed potatoes.

I think simple dishes run the risk of being uncared for because they don't take much concentration to prepare, unfortunately,  doing that, you end up with boring, uninspired food.
So....Chez Moi. Really decent food, really mediocre service, at best.  We had two servers, fine. We waited about 20 minutes for our drinks after waiting 15 to order and looked at the bar, where the barkeep was jaw-jacking and definitely NOT making our drinks. All in all, service was just SUPER slow. Unapologetically slow. And the food was decent. Beet and Goat Cheese Salad was BOMB. Everything else was really just decent. I wouldn't go again on purpose unless it were for the oysters which they don't serve in the weekends. Ehh?! I'm all set.
It's cozy, good french food for a reasonable price. Nice staff and music. I'd recommend! Ps: from a frenchie
I was pleasantly surprised by this local French restaurant. My boyfriend really wanted to find a place to have a meal in tribute to Notre Dame after the fire and this was a perfect spot for that.

At the start the service was a little iffy (we opted to sit at the bar), but after a little bit as the crowd slowed down, we were happy to find the staff accommodating and charming to talk to.

As a vegetarian, there's not always a lot of options for me in French cuisine, but they were willing to make a veg option of the risotto special. It was surprisingly scrumptious. My boyfriend got classic oysters (they have several flavor options) and fries - if you do anything at all, definitely get the fries. They were incredible!

Overall we had a lovely date night and will return again soon.
Celebrated my birthday dinner there with 7 people last weekend.  Food included steak tartare, steak frites, tuna tartare, kale salad, onion soup, and grilled octopus.  All good.  Server a little (maybe more than a little) chatty and attentive at the wrong times (when we got the check).  All in all, nice neighborhood place, and would happily return.
PROS:
- Crispy Chicken Sandwich - OMG this is amazing! You have to get this! Portions are big and the chicken was fried to perfection and it was juicy. 5 STARS

- Mushrooms, Cheese, Spinach Crepe - very filling. Very delicious however it was slightly on the salty side. 4 STARS.

CONS:
- Chez Moi Cocktail (Vodka, Fresh Mint, Lime, Cr√®me de Cassis, Seltzer)- was rec'd by the waitress to get this but I did not like it. I did not taste the Creme de Cassis at all in this drink. It was mostly vodka and fresh mint.

- I had heartburn from drinking the cocktail with the fried chicken. I guess next time I am not going to mix alcohol with greasy and fried food. Lesson learned.
I keep coming back here-because the food is so good : ).  My husband and I have tried a lot of the menu and have thoroughly enjoyed every meal.  Great place for a date night or a cozy reunion with a friend or two.  Not sure about very large groups, especially without a reservation, as the place is a little small.  Which brings me to why I took off a star.  It can be very loud and tight here, waiters are crawling over the chairs and each other to take and deliver orders and I just don't enjoy that aspect as much. Also, maybe because of this?, wait service tends to be a bit insincere and even rude at times.
Just a lovely Mother's Day brunch venue. My daughter had lobster eggs Benedict, which had lots of rich flavor, and a beautiful presentation. I loved my Croque Monsieur, a lovely, crunchy grilled cheese with bechamel and gruyere.

We saw in a window, enjoying the fresh upbeat ambiance with a view through white lace cafe curtains, and had fine service, even on this very busy day.

A new favorite!
I keep missing chances to have oyster happy hour and brunch here, but I have been to their downstairs speakeasy (The Boudoir) and had drinks at their main bar. They have a great cocktail program - the kind where at least one ingredient in each drink will make you go ""hmm"". They even have a drink featuring foie gras! I had the bacon infused rye whiskey drink because bacon. Equal parts yum and strong. Cocktails are reasonably priced at $12. Super cool bartenders as well! Great crowd, and go downstairs for some dancing afterward!
I was really, really excited to try this place - but I walked out with mixed feelings about it.
Food was ok, but not memorable nor truly french.
Decor is understated, but clean - that's all I can say about it.

There were so many hiccups in service, tho....
We really wanted to try their bacon-infused cocktail, but were told they just started infusing it and it will take couple hours. Seriously, don't you supposed to do all prep before restaurant opens? Ok, we got different drinks unread.
Than oysters mixup happen - waitress did not seem to know which ones were which for reorder, which led to series of trips to the kitchen. When that was in progress, a guy walked by our table and dropped drink on the edge - not a word said. What? Did he leave it there to drink later??? All confused, we stare at it. Flagged that guy 5 min later - turned out, they did find that bacon infused drink. Ummm, ok.

I really hope they get their service issues together - this has lots of potential.
Our favorite spot when we're in Brooklyn. Great salad and risotto. Friendly staff, nice ambience. Definitely recommend.
Great place for decent French food. Well priced. Portions are big. Never walk away hungry. Just decent good food for a good price.
I made a reservation for dinner for four people on a Sunday night, and we were immediately seated when we arrived. Our server was very attentive without hovering around. Great ambiance with very cozy-feeling lighting.

I was expecting small portions, but I was pleasantly surprised to find the portions to be the perfect amount for me. Run-through of the food:

Escargots - Oh. My. God. The garlic parsley butter. The snail itself was soft, buttery deliciousness. All I can say is, Mmmm...

Wild Skate Fish - The fish was a little too salty for my taste, but mixing it with the mashed potato balanced it out. I really enjoyed the fava beans and artichoke, and I'm usually not into beans of any kind.

Seared Duck Breast - This is a must order. The meat is so tender and juicy, and the orange sauce paired really well with the duck flavor.

Truffle Oil Risotto Special of the Day - This was good, but a couple of bites were enough for me. It was rich and creamy.

Creme Br√ªl√©e - Smooth as silk with a nice burnt sugared top.

√éle Flottante - One of the most amazing desserts I've ever had. It was like I had a cloud on my tongue, and the milky sauce was not overly sweet. This was perfection.
Amazing food and service. And the lounge downstairs is to die for. Love the ambience there. Perfect for a intimate date night with someone very special.
Food is excellent. Service is great. Can get a little crowded but so worth it! Love his place

They are all about the customer- making you glad you chose to have a meal there. Service is tops as is the carefully crafted cuisine. While the food, service and atmosphere will be presenting you with finer dining, it is more relaxed and unfussy. There is a reason they have been around long enough to see other revered places come and go- they know what they do and they they do it well.
This is the kind of place that you can easily enjoy a date or impress out of town guests that probably have pre-conceived notions of what Brooklyn dining is like.
Once thing is for sure- not only will you leave satisfied, you'll probably already be planning your next visit.
The outdoor dining was nice and cute with the lighting in a pretty quiet neighborhood. We had the octopus and crab cake as our starters. The octopus was tasty and el Dante inside. This was my first time ever having elk chop! I was blown away! The seasoning was great and the elk was cooked perfectly. The elk also wasn't too gamy paired perfectly with Turley Juvenile Zinfandel. What a little charm in the neighborhood!!
Very welcomed restaurant in a historic Brooklyn Heights. Very well spaced distance between tables, attentive server and bus boys - followed all the distance rules. Food is amazing. Unique elk chops, soft shell crabs - this is what you have to come for! Salad was great too. Perfect portion size. Definitely must try.
Nice setting and outdoor dining. Pretty good cocktails, and the octopus was well cooked. However, the entrees were lackluster. The salmon with mustard three ways was very exciting on the menu, but on the plate was just fish with some mustard sauce and garnish. The duck with mushrooms was disappointing - the mushrooms were basically stewed in a sweet brown gravy that I would expect to see in a cafeteria more than a restaurant.
Came here for brunch. I ordered Tortilla Espanola and it comes with a side salad. I asked if i could sub it for anything else and they said no? They said I can only remove it and then I would have to order a side of somthing else?

When my Tortilla came, it was tiny, maybe half a portion and it was dry. The salad that I didn't want was wilted. When the check came, I saw they charged me $4 for my gingerale???
During these tough time this place delivers! They are doing ""Take Away"" and it is great!
Wow.
This place is an institution, and definitely one of the best places you can go to in the neighborhood for a real sit down meal.    They moved down the street from their old location but the food is the same and the atmosphere is better than before.

In the fall their wild game menu is wild!

Year round the menu is filled with hits.

When my girlfriend goes a week without giving me a hard time this is where I bring her for date night, and they never disappoint us.

Sit down have some wine and choose anything on the menu, you can't go wrong.
The mustard chops weren't welcomed, thank you--

I ordered the elk chops; they had an excessive, overpowering amount of mustard. I enjoy and can handle well spicy foods, but this was an overkill. I was tearing up, and couldn't taste the meat allegedly exquisite meat underneath the mustard. Shame on the chef!
The black sea bass and the consomm√© were alright, to be fair.
Nice Pinot Noir, ok.

Overall:
Bah.
This place is awesome. I highly recommend!
Great service, fresh ingredient, and food is just amazing.
Bread, soup, salad, crab cake, salmon, steak, and tiramisu
Impeccable
Amazing restaurant in Brooklyn Heights! will definitely be back
We have been coming here about annually for the past 10 years. It's a long trek from CT, but it's worth it. We love wild game and this place knows how to bring out the best in it. Walnut crusted chicken was so surprisingly delicious. The elk chop superb. The duck (both sour cherry sauce and ginger soy) were more than expected.
The deserts are not a strong point here. Mediocre. Particularly in contrast to the strong medley of flavors in the main courses.
Still, we will be back!
KenScale: 8.0/10

My wife Jun and I go on a double date from time to time with my former co-worker and her husband (an avid foodie) to check out new restaurants. Ever since the couple had a baby, it has become a bit more challenging to find a place that could work for the next restaurant trips. The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights so I asked them if there is any restaurant in their neighborhood that is convenient for them to meet up for dinner before the summer's end. The foodie husband said Henry's End which I had never heard of until that point was his all-time Brooklyn Heights favorite. I was certainly intrigued and took on their offer to come visit Brooklyn Heights to visit the restaurant. When Jun and I walked in, I had an impression at the moment that I was inside a dive bar with exposed bricks and a very quaint d√©cor. Not that the venue's vibe really matters for me; Jun and I dislike places with fancy settings but food that turns out to be underwhelming more than places with humbling settings but have very delicious food. And surprisingly the food at Henry's End turned out to be quite good.

The menu at Henry's End is a loose group of New American dishes with locally sourced ingredients and influences from different parts of the country. The dishes here tend to be on a more rustic side. Jun wished the sauce were slightly less sweet, but still very much enjoyed the barbecue ribs whose texture was more or less perfect. The shrimp saut√©ed with spicy Andouille sausage was also very nice for an appetizer, with a Southern style that was hearty and satisfying. Jun, always a duck meat aficionado, ordered the duckling honey-ginger that the foodie husband highly recommended. I stole some bites from the duckling and it was cooked quite aptly to give the texture that the duck meat must have to shine at a dinner table. On the other hand, the main dish that I had ordered, veal scallopine saut√©ed with roasted garlic, lemon, capers and basil, was a little bit too aggressive in the seasoning department even though the meat itself was gently prepared. Don't skip desserts at Henry's End! You have two different versions of mud pie, and the Mrs. Mud Pie version that Jun chose was absolutely decadent with vanilla and Heath Bar Crunch ice creams on a Graham Cracker crust, topped with hot butterscotch sauce. Same goes for the delightful Persian lime pie, consisting of fresh lime pastry cream on a Graham Cracker crust. While neither dish looked too healthy, we didn't mind feeling a little bit guilty and promised each other that we will put extra efforts into our gym classes for the rest of the week.

I have no idea how difficult it is to snag a reservation at Henry's End but the restaurant was mostly packed with local Brooklynites during our Wednesday meal so booking in advance seems like a good idea. As noted above, the d√©cor and atmosphere of the restaurant might scare you off a little but I suggest that you get comfortable with embracing the old-school vibe of this place. The wine list at Henry's End was quite a surprise; I didn't expect to see so many bottles, many of them from California, from older vintages all the way to the 20th century at bargain prices. There are also daily wines by the glass available that you should take advantage of. Henry's End is one of those restaurants that if you live in the neighborhood you would want to come back again and again for a reliable dining experience. Jun and I certainly would love to come back again to try other dishes and explore the wine list.
A true gem of Brooklyn Heights! A very unique menu featuring many fresh ""game"" meats (I.e rabbit, deer, duck, etc) which maintains unbelievable quality and is well worth the price.

Food: I had ordered the a mixed plates with duck, rabbit, and venison and everything was impeccable. My friend described his chicken as best chicken if his life.

Drinks: short but fantastic beer menu featuring local gems. I ordered wine special which was excellent and fairly priced.

Service: really amazing service. Wait staff was very attentive and genuinely cares we were satisfied.

Vibes: My favorite part of Henry's End is it is not pretentious. To have this level of food and service it is refreshing to have a relaxed unassuming atmosphere.
Went here because they have ""game meat"" which sounded really interesting. Well, I finally had kangaroo - it was diced meat in a pasta wrap. Not really that interesting. Tasted like chicken.

So that was sort of disappointing. Still, the food, ambience, and conversation was wonderful... we did have duck, and a few other interesting meats that were truly tasty.

As non NYC folks in Brooklyn, we engaged with a man who did reviews of many many NYC area restaurants - he did a blog, and was into the many hundreds of restaurants.... he said this was one of his favorites.

Overall, we had a great meal (twice) and had a great time. Good food, good wine, ate kangaroo... what more could you want? ;)
This is a bold statement... but Henry's End may have one of the best menus in all of New York City.  Just go.  The end.
My wife and I and friends have been coming to this restaurant for years.

We are disappointed that the dishes now do not include rice and a few vegetables.  The cost is probably around 50 cents.  Dishes like mash potatoes which tasted like instant mashed potatoes do not go with Sole with Lobster.  Then there is the glare from the sun shining from the building right across from the restaurant. It's not like there is a fantastic view, there is no view.   Anyway the glare makes enjoying the experience very unpleasant to say the least.  Everyone would want to sit across from their loved one, not side by side.

Then there is the wine.  Chardonnays that are eleven years old are usually not good as was the case with this wine.  They used to have very good wine at fairly high prices, now the wine is more expensive and is not a good quality.

Then there is the atmosphere which is not the same as the previous location which was dark and romantic instead the new place is very bright and sterile.  Bring back the candles like they had before.
And the wait staff has much to be desired.  They are not very friendly as in they take your order and someone else brings you your order.  The waiter did not even thank us for the tip!

Non the less, the owner tries his best to be accommodating.  He does need to be open to installing some nice shades to cut down on the glare, improve his wine selection and include rice and vegetables with dishes as he did before.  Also I would suggest that he warmly greet his guests to make them feel special.

Why do things have to change for the worst!
Amazing food. Very traditional dishes and cozy ambiance. Anything you ask for is delicious. Wine list has plenty of great wines. Love the truffled French fries.
Our friends from Brooklyn brought us here for dinner last night. My husband and I were blown away! I wasn't even hungry but the food was so amazing I cleaned my plate! The four of us all ordered completely different dishes and everything was so good! I had the Scottish Salmon which was cooked to perfection and melted in my mouth. My husband had the Steak Au Poivre which was also cooked to perfection and had such delicious flavor. The food is very fresh and the service is great. This will be a regular for us when we travel into Brooklyn!
An old stand by on Henry Street in Brooklyn Heights consistently serving great food for many years. They also serve Game Meat every fall. You can't go wrong with what you order. The steaks are particularly very good.
Welcomed very quickly and sat immediately. Felt the servers were a little inattentive once our order was placed. Food was amazing! A bit loud for good conversation but overall a great experience
ABOMINABLE !
I went to the old Henry's End through the 90s and early 2000s.
I thought it would be exceptional enough for a friend's birthday dinner who I wanted to have good food and a good experience. That did not happen, and to a shocking extent. The food was revolting slop that looked like what you would find served in a prison, and (literally) toxic to an extent you would not EVEN find in a prison. I have never written (or felt compelled to write) anything like this--and the following--ever before.

I made reservations a week before, discussed that it was a friend's birthday, and requested a good table as I was booking in advance. This meant nothing when arrived as we were sat in their new not very exceptional dining room, at one of the even less exceptional (or desirable) tables, just as if we walked in off the street. When I asked if a better table could be provided (there were a few better empty tables in the room) I was told no, and that people reserved the other tables THAT day. However, after a while we WE'RE given a less bad table and told ""people canceled"" as if a favor was being done for us.

We started with drinks. I was given a martini on the rocks that was watered down from the ""couple"" if ice cubes in it. My friend's daiquiri was unrecognizable from any daiquiri EVER and tasted like nothing I have ever tasted even in the worst dive bar. She sent the drink back, and it was not the first thing that got rejected from our table during the evening. (I should have rejected everything.)

I had started dinner with the Caesar salad, she, the Duck Mousse. The salad was 'OK' but the mousse was more a puree than mousse and came with the unwanted surprise of chutney mixed in the under portion of it. This was NOT listed in the menu description. We also both switched to wine knowing no ""mixing skill"" would be required. THIS is the least awful part of ""dinner.""

The entrees came. We both ordered ""Braised Duck with Seasonal Wild Mushrooms, Shallots, Thyme, and Lingonberries."" My dinner companion ordered mashed potatoes, and I ordered saut√©ed spinach. The plates with the duck were non-descript brown heaps of sauce with something underneath. The spinach was swimming in water and the mashed potatoes were slopped onto the plate in lumpy mound. We each tasted our side dishes. Mine was at least not overcooked (I would suffer form having eaten it later.) Hers caused an expression on her face that caused me immediately to taste it. And I was APPALLED.
It was a tasteless mountain of paste except for the overwhelming amount of SALT that had been DUMPED into it. She then tasted her duck, looked horrified, and said ""I cannot eat this."" I tasted it as well and it was horrendously tough, over cooked, and comprised (again) mostly of salt. This was to an extent I have never encountered before. If there were mushrooms, rice or shallots (described in the menu description) anywhere on the plate, I could not tell. Everything was mixed into an ugly overbearing brown sauce that was slathered over the inedible --equally ugly--brown carcass on her plate. BOTH of her dishes got sent back. Unfortunately, my friend's appetite was destroyed at this point and she said she could not eat anything else.

MY duck was not so badly overcooked, but equally buried underan ugly, heavy brown sauce. Perhaps out of shook over encountering one horrible thing after another, I ate my duck along with my spinach. It was not good and I would pay for that--in a couple of ways. My paying with my health, continued the day after eating at Henry's End, by feeling extremely unwell and like I mainlined SALT.

I convinced my friend to order dessert. She acquiesced. ANOTHER big mistake. Her ""Black and White Mousse"" was a thin layer of chocolate mousse under a thick layer of frozen cream. My Chocolate Hazelnut Cake was nothing you can't get in a diner, except for the ""extra"" taste of salt. This added to the toxic levels that at that point, had already been delivered into my system.

I foolishly ordered coffee. The coffee had a ""burnt"" odor, and when I poured the cream into it, a curdle ""chunk"" plopped into the cup, sending little curdled particles of cream out in a ripple effect throughout the surface of the beverage.

Today as last night, I pay with my health by still feeling ill from the mega does of salt I can still taste and was DUMPED in COPIUS amounts into almost everything served. I usually have no problem with salt. But today, the thought of it makes me feel ill. As I and my dinner companion both believe the duck was prepared MANY hours before it was served, it may have been left out to accumulate bacteria. That would account for how bad I felt the following day.

I saved up for last night. If anyone thinks as I did--of their good memories of the old ""Henry's End"" with a mind towards going, there PLEASE reconsider.

Shame on you Henry's End... for the last time I was there !
A great place. I first came here to celebrate hubby's birthday and we came back to celebrate my birthday here. The atmosphere is dim lighting and close quarters. We experienced great meals and great service both visits. The service is very attentive and they listen when you inform them of special occasions. You get a free entree for your birthday if you sign up with them.
They are known for their wild game festival and their usual menu has wild game specials. The regular menu is also great. Portions are generous, I believe we took doggie bags home both visits. There's no bar area at Henry's but there is a bar on the corner, one storefront away, which came in handy because it Poured on my birthday.
Outstanding! Very talented chefs they have create an outstanding, robust menu. Not a lot of tables and, filled in on a Wednesday night. People like atmosphere, I like food.....this is the place for the latter. I heard they were moving to accommodate more guests after 40 + years. I hope they bring the charm this place had.
Pricy for the food they serve.
Don't like there strict reservation policy.
Waters make you feel like your just a costumer.
There food an service is not worth the price.
I overhead one of my students talking about the wonderful meal he had at Henry's End so I just knew this was the kind of place I needed to bring my boyfriend. We've been to Henry's End twice now. Once last summer and most recently last week for the 2nd phase of the Wild Game Festival.

The Wild Game Festival is definitely a very special dining experience. First of all, the service you will receive no matter what time
of year will always be exceptional. The restaurant is on the smaller side so if definitely recommend making a reservation. We had a reservation for 6pm. We arrived a few minutes past 6 but were seated right away.

The kitchen is open so you are exposed to the sounds of the chefs working and you can see that they are working very hard to prepare very special dishes. For appetizers we ordered the kangaroo potstickers and the game Charcuterie Plate. The potstickers were delicious and you would never know it consisted of kangaroo meat if no one told you. It tasted kind of like pork to me. The game Charcuterie Plate consisted of rabbit sausage, pork belly, and Wild Game p√¢t√©. All was very good. For my entree I had the crab stuffed chicken while my boyfriend had the elk chops. Both entrees were delicious and packed with great flavors.

Needless to say we will be back. Hopefully soon for the 3rd phase of the Wild Game Festival. As each phase has a different menu. I definitely recommend Henry's End. Also a sure to sign up for their Birthday club as you will receive a $25 coupon for your birthday.
I had the pleasure to dine at Henry's End twice so far. The first time was in spring and the second time in fall. They have different seasonal menus. The first time I had a delicious salmon and cous cous dish.
The second time me and my boyfreind went there unaware of their wild game festival. So it was a pretty fun night because we had to decide between stick to the usual or venture into... Kangaroo meat! We had the kangaroo and it was very good, tender with sweet notes of berry (since the marination) and served with sweet potatoes and spinach.

Our wild board pappardelle were also great, I felt like I was in Italy for one second!

The wait staff was impeccable, both times.

I really like the atmosphere of Henry's End, there's something special quite cinematic about it, almost a vibe of what you imagine  Brooklyn was years back.
This used to be our favorite, a neighborhood gem, but as the prices have gone up the quality has declined.

We're a pass there are much better places in the neighborhood.
I've gone there for two decades but no more.
I have been going here for around the last 15 years. A great restaurant with great service and even better food.  I have never had a bad meal here- the steak au poivre is to die for (I often like to order a side of mushrooms with it).
It met all our expectations and more! The crabcakes appetizer were large, meaty and delicious. The wild mushroom salad was also wonderful. The entrees were very large. The specials included a duck with sour cherry sauce that was outstanding. Also up to that level was the sole with lobster and mushrooms.  Our third guest had walnut crusted chicken which was very large and it too was outstanding. The service was friendly and sufficiently attentive.
Such a nice place with great service and wonderful steaks.   The au poivre is a delight, ample, tender and flavorful.  Sides were delicious and wine excellent.
A new friend in the Heights suggests that we eat local so I immediately scan my trusty Yelp app to reconnoiter the area.  We lived here in the mid-80's but by now, things have changed!  She's not a big fan of tomato-based Italian food, in an admonishing tone, says ""it's the nightshade family!"" It's fine. Anyone who reads my posts knows that I'm an Italian food junkie, but I'm in a mood for something different.  After hemming and hawing, we walk up to Henry Street and decide on Henry's End.  Charlie the dog is lying near the entrance and gives us a friendly greeting. I ask him if he'd like a martini and he jumps up and wags his tail. My kind of dog!! It's a fairly nice evening so we decide to sit outside. My friend's been under the weather but agrees that we should order a nice bottle of red wine. Matthew our waiter suggests a montepulciano and it's superb. We share a walnut vinaigrette salad with mushrooms. It's a perfect starter. The menu has two duck entries, we each order a different one.  My duck is Asian style honey ginger, Crisp skin, not fatty at all,  almost like Peking duck. I love it.  My friend's duck is more ragu style, with mushrooms, equally delicious. The conversation is animated and flowing.  But wait, something's missing! We realize there's no side dish. We signal Matthew who apologizes and offers to get us saut√©ed asparagus on the house.  He also offers free dessert. Wow what a nice gesture!  We top the meal off with apple cobbler and tiramisu. Coffee and espresso. Gee what a great meal!  We'll definitely be coming back!  Good night Charlie wherever you are!
An update for the new location: The food was just as amazing as it was at the previous location. Despite only being a month into their new location service was seamless and it was great to see mostly familiar faces from the old location. There is also a nice bar area at the new location. So happy to report that they are keeping up with the good work. We had the tuna orecchiette pasta, the mushroom duck, the fried chicken, gazpacho, and goat cheese salad. All very very good!
Great little spot that has only been in its new digs for 3 weeks! We did make a 6pm reservation, thankfully we did because we would have been waiting for a bit. We were greeted by the owner, who sat us on the patio! We were out celebrating our anniversary and they delivered on every aspect of the meal. Nice ""Crisp"" brew to start off the meal. Crab cakes, Shrimp app with some delicious combo of flavors. But wait there's more...Chicken, spinach, goat cheese , fig jelly...mic drop, pick it up; Steak Diane that you could have drank the sweet flavor that blanketed the fine cut of meat. Side of asparagus and real buttery mashed...there is no way we can do dessert, but we do coffee. The special anniversary dessert was delivered which was a nice touch, much appreciated! Price point was in line with the food quality, service and experience. We are from out of towners but felt the urge to write this review because more people need to experience this little gem that has been doing it well for a long while.  5 out of 5 stars
I went recently using the birthday coupon and can't believe i've never written a review before.  I must say this is a solid local restaurant with incredibly friendly staff and creative versions of standard American dishes.  I had an almond-crusted chicken and my girlfriend had the spinach and goat cheese-stuffed chicken breast.  Both were a unique take on your typical chicken dinner and excellent.  I live in the neighborhood because I feel like its more of a community than other parts of Manhattan I've lived in and Henry's End  has a warm presence that feels like part of a community too.  They had moved to a new location a block away from where they were before  since the last time I ate there and, while it lost a little of its tavern/bar look, it has gained a positive addition as now they have some nice outdoor space for al fresco dining. Recommended.
Really a 3.5 --wish we could give half stars. Very cozy, small establishment , just wished the food was a little better. Both of us ordered the prix fixe. Scallops were good, sole was nothing special, but soft shell crab linguine was delicious. The desserts were underwhelming -- apple cobbler was very mushy on the inside.
You could pass its nondescript storefront by but you should NOT!  I had the honey-ginger duckling, my wife had the Steak Diane.  Both were incredible.  The duck was the best I have had for years (and there was a lot of duck consumed in those years).

Also, the mashed potatoes were creamy and dripping with butter.

Like the Terminator, ""WE'LL BE BACK!""
This is a beautiful restaurant that has been around for decades.
The truffle fries pair well with the steak au poivre.
I enjoyed the walnut crusted chicken finished with a blue cheese sauce. Yum!
Make reservations!
If you want a brilliant dining experience, be pampered with great service,  all while enjoying amazingly prepared food...Henry's End is for you. So many restaurants in NYC...and we've been to this restaurant twice in two weeks...it's that good! Our first meal we enjoyed sharing the Kangaroo Potstickers, and the Duckling with Wild Mushrooms, shallots, thyme, and lingonberries. With this we enjoyed a bottle of Tempore Joven 2004, from Agagon Spain. Everything was amazing. Our second trip we shared the Buffalo Hanger Steak with Housemade Steak Sauce and Truffled Fries. Oh WOW...Tender steak! This night we opted for beer and enjoyed ""Two Roads ""Road 2 Ruin"" Double IPA Stratford Connecticut,"" and ""Oskar Blues ""Old Chubb"" Scotch Ale Brevard, North Carolina."" They complimented this meal well for us. Our server, Mike on both nights, was exemplary. And the little inside scoop...the restaurant name is because this restaurant is where Henry Street ends. Go figure...So Very Clever!
My last visit here was back in 2013 to have the Steak au Poivre and it was just absolutely fantastic. In another life, this was my own little personal kitchen, a few blocks away. Unfortunately, now I live in California. I know I am a bit late leaving this review but I know many of their signature dishes haven't changed and I just had to leave a review upon reading a complaint about the 'presentation' of the dishes. Which is all in the beauty of Henry's End.

Someone else was complaining about the presentation? Simple dish? How do you want to spruce up a dish like Steak au Poivre you genius? Do you think the Chef should put some pink boba on the side or maybe add taro creme to a classic such as Caesar Salad? Maybe some unicorn fairy dust to spruce up your Southern Fried Chicken?

I totally get it, okay? People like something new and exciting. You want to see some fairy dust in your pink unicorn latte. I totally get it, but here's the thing... You see, some things aren't meant to have pink dust and purple creme dressed all over the dishes. Some things are classics and just... Well, my father used to say to me... 'Son, don't fix what ain't broke'.

Now please, travel the world over and dine at wherever you want for that latest food craze and when the fad has passed, you will always want that Steak au Poivre. Made with so much love for life and love for the fellow human. Which cannot be found or replicated anywhere else, except at this quaint little restaurant down the end of Henry Street.
Very unique restaurant in a great location, a block and a half off the Brooklyn Bridge. The restaurant is not large, and was well packed on a Saturday night.

They offer a unique experience in that they offer a large selection of ""game meat"" in a very well-prepared manner. I tried the:

1)Turtle soup - Delicious. Tasted like a chili. Not at all gamey.
2)Kangaroo Kebabs - My favorite thing that I ate. Tastes exactly like high end steak. Juicy, tender, and not at all gamey. If you told me it was beef I would have believed you.
3)Elk Chops - Everyone else I was with loved them, but I don't like gamey  tasting meat, and there is certainly a gamey aftertaste to the elk chops. I was not a fan.
4)Venison sausage - Solid sausage. Taste unique. Not particularly strong flavor, but enjoyable.
5)Quail - Great. Tasted unique. Not exactly chicken but close. The texture was different as well.

The desserts were also great as well. the Mrs. Mud Pie was a generous portion of ice cream, on a bed of caramel with a nice crust. Delicious.

The service was good. Not the best I've had in that there were several times I wish I had more water, but they did pass by a few times to check on us.

The only deduction is for value. This is a pricey place. I certainly enjoyed some of the dishes, and I was able to scratch several things off my food bucket list during this meal. I would come back, but I would do it with the intention of trying other exotic things, rather than try the same things I've had already.
My boyfriend found this restaurant on Yelp so we decided to go. The atmosphere in here is nice and cozy. The kitchen is open so if you sit by the back you can look over and see the cooks preparing the meals.

I ordered the Prix Fixe menu, Spring Onion soup, which was good. As an entree I had Walnut Crusted Chicken Breast with a side order of mashed potatoes, it was amazing! And for dessert I got the chocolate banana bread pudding. It was good and was enough to share with my boyfriend.

My boyfriend ordered the Mixed Game Grill which featured elk chops, stuffed quail, and rabbit sausage. He's the more adventurous one when it comes to ordering different things. He really loved this dish!

I would definitely suggest this place and I plan on going back!

So packed that we didn't think we were going to be able to get any seating. Luckily one of the workers saw us struggling and managed to find a table on the second floor and while it was a little tightly packed, it felt cozy and added to the ambience. Since the service/staff were friendly, it set the tone for the rest of the night. Got some Irish coffees, deviled eggs, pork sliders, and other drinks. Oysters were very good too!
Fun spot in FiDi. Staff are friendly and attentive. They have drink specials and a few jugs of some sort of Tullamore Dew punch chilling on ice. Tried one... whew. Potent.
The crowd seems to be a bit varied. I was in on a Saturday night so it was not happy hour for FiDi employees. The bottom floor is quite narrow as is many a bar in NYC. The selection is very good if you like brown liquor. I'm a vodka drinker so that was a bit less but they have the standards.
The people coming in and out were 20 somethings and 30 somethings. The people who came and stayed were 40 somethings and up. Interesting selection of tunes.
I'll be back!
Soccer, Bud Light, & fantasy football...super popular things I simply don't get.  You can add the Dead Rabbit to that list.  The food, drinks, atmosphere, it's all good, but the prices (even for NYC) and how crowded it gets are huge negatives.  I suspect I will be back again and hope to have the same experience as others.  Maybe my expectations were simply too high.
Good old bar. It has an old medieval feel to it. The Dead Rabbit has a few different sections. Each are unique but they're all charming. You can have an intimate chat or get rowdy.

First floor you come to is the main bar. It has a great selection of beer. The Irish Red is the house selection. It's about $9 for a pint. Yes all the drinks are expensive, as they are at all the bars around this. Cocktails are about $18 each. That's more than a meal at most places. Also it's part of the reason why I haven't ordered any food. Another reason is because it's not exactly vegetarian friendly. They have a few salads but these are very pricey for some greens and tomatoes.

I would come back to check out the other rooms here. The Parlor Room sounds particularly cool if you can get a reservation. You'll unfortunately be paying a lot more for the upstairs.
Cane here for drinks on a Friday night and put our name  down immediately for the upstairs bar. The downstairs bar is like any other local bar but they had this Irish coffee that's warm and delicious especially in the winter. It's got like a cold foam on top but hot liquid on the bottom. I really enjoyed this hot drink and it was quite good. After about 45 minutes, the buzzer rang and we were able to go upstairs for a drink where it was more intimate and the cocktails were more unique.

Shared 2 cocktails
PEACE PROCESS (HOT)
SCOTCH WHISKY, JAMAICAN RUM, NUTMEG LIQUEUR, FERNET, WALNUT MILK, CHOCOLATE

SOUND AS A BELL
IRISH WHISKEY, AMBER VERMOUTH, APPLE WINE, FIG LEAF, PASSIONFRUIT, CORN SILK TEA, BLACKSTRAP BITTERS

Overall, the cocktails here are pricey but all well made. I particularly enjoyed all the hot drinks especially since it's winter time. Both cocktails I had were unique and the rest of the menu looks delicious as well. Come here if you're craving a unique cocktail.
I had high hopes for this place as it was rated really well on one of those top bars in the world list. It was surprisingly empty when we went on a Saturday night, but I guess the FiDi crowd doesn't really go out at this time, and I get they closed awfully early for a bar (I think at like 2? With the late night menu starting pass midnight).

The drinks were okay. My boyfriend got one of the lower level drinks and it tasted pretty light but was tasty as a smoothie (so-so as a cocktail). It had like Greek yogurt and coconut in it, and he liked it which was what matters.

I got one of the higher level ones and it tasted a bit too much like Islay Scotch. It was too much that all you could taste was the peatiness and nothing else in the drink (in comparison to say a penicillin, where the peatiness just comes on the nose).

Still had a great time there though and service was top notch. Our server refilled our waters on the clock!
Great bar and super lively on a Saturday night! I stopped in around 8pm with a group of friends and luckily we were able to get a big table in the back on the first floor. It was super crowded and tightly packed but the table they gave us was like having our own private room! I only saw the first floor which had two rooms, a bar in each room. There is also an upstairs (which I heard is like a lounge) however when we went to check it out after dinner, the bouncer said it was too full.

I ordered the vodka cocktail ($16) which was super refreshing. It tasted like a light cucumber summer cocktail; absolutely delicious! One of my friends got the Irish coffee ($14) which was also amazing. Not too strong; perfectly balanced! We ordered the deviled eggs with lobster ($15), truffle fries ($12) and the Guinness bread pudding dessert. The only thing I would not recommend was the bread pudding. It was very dry even with the ice cream on top. The menu was massive (see picture below), so you are bound to find something you enjoy!

Our waitress was very patient and super friendly. She was able to split our check 4 ways and took a pic for the table. She recommended my cocktail drink and had the bartender make a custom mocktail for one of my friends (which she really enjoyed)!

I will definitely be back here and would highly recommend this place!! Get here early to get a seat!
Creative and interesting cocktail list that seems o frequently have new options, and great food (we especially love the stew).
Ok the Irish coffee is 100% worth the hype. How do they make this magical drink? It's not at all bitter. In fact, it's dangerously smooth. That said it's not particularly strong or a large drink. But it's yuuuummmmy.

The bar has an upstairs, but it was closed when we were there.

We came at 10:30pm on a Wednesday and the bar was hopping. We found 2 seats at the bar. We left around 12:30, and the bar was packed.

We didn't have any food, so I can't speak to that.
I came here for a holiday party. The downstairs was extremely crowded, but luckily we had the third floor reserved. The space was cozy and intimate. I loved the Irish coffee cocktail. It's the perfect warm, boozy drink for winter and it's topped with a thick layer of sweet cream. Ask for it with nutmeg!

The Dead Rabbit also provided catering for this party. The charcuterie spread provided a great selection of meats and cheeses. The lobster deviled eggs were meh. There wasn't enough lobster on them for me to be impressed. The short rib on the short rib sliders was very tender.

Maybe not a great place if you're not into crowds, but perfect if you're looking to reserve a private room for a party! Service was friendly and attentive.
Came in for drinks a couple times.  Solid cocktails and amazing Irish coffee.  Only thing we tried to eat was the devilled eggs with lobster, which was delicious.  Looked at what others were eating and everything looked good.  Will definitely be back to try some more food

Great athmosphere and very good service.
Such a cool place! Wanted to come for a long time and glad I finally made it. Came pretty early on a Saturday in November, maybe 5 pm, and it was already decently full. In the downstairs part it kind of reminds me of a fancier cocktail version of McSorley's with the old school decor and sawdust on the floor, but it's still really chill and not stuffy. There are two sides of the bar although there's more seating on the far side. We (3 of us) put our name down for a table and we luckily got one after 10-15 only which was nice because it was crowded enough to be uncomfortable standing if you didn't have a spot at the bar. Cocktails are inventive and fun and we didn't get food but it looked good.

We then went upstairs after putting our name down and not waiting that long. Upstairs has such a different vibe, and this was the dead rabbit I was expecting. It's darker, quiet, and there are tables / seats for everyone with no loiterers or unnecessary crowds. This is where the menu looks like a graphic novel / dark comic book and I just absolutely loved it!! I couldn't read the whole thing at the time, but it also appeared to be part of a series so I didn't have the background, but I loved it all the same. Pages and pages of different cocktails went with the story (I think?) and were arranged from lightest to booziest. They were excellent and I loved everything about it. They also give you a little starter drink served in a tiny teacup, love!

Then we went back downstairs after and met a few more people, and they got in no problem. Such a cool spot with two different vibes depending on what you're looking for, both awesome! Will be back if I'm in this neighborhood!
Came here on a Friday night to get some beers and tried their deviled eggs with bacon ($10) and Lamb shepherd's pie ($20), which had curried lamb with potato puree. Both were pretty good and went well with the beers. They have a wide range of selection for cocktails and Irish whiskey, so I want to come back for those.

The price point for foods and drinks here is a bit steep, but given that there aren't that many bars like this in FiDi area I guess that's where the value comes from. It's spacious and pretty big inside, but it's very crowded as it's a very popular spot.

I liked the lively vibe even though, just like any other bars, it's extremely loud and hard to hear each other. However, I do recommend here if you're looking for a decent bar in the FiDi area!
The Dead Rabbit is a great spot for drinks and food. Located in the Financial District,it's a mix between Irish pub and New York cocktail bar.
The first floor with its lively bar, is crowded and loud, but it's part of the charm, making it inviting, warm and non-pretentious.
After enjoying a couple cocktails and admiring the bartenders expertise, I can see how this place was named the best in the world.  Each cocktail is a minutious mix of ingredients expertly picked from mysterious small bottles seating right behind the bar.  I wonder how how long it must take to master this craft.
The food is also prepared with care, offering Irish fare, perfect to go with your craft beer, or cocktail.  I recommend getting a selection of Irish breads to eat with your oysters or to just savour by itself, yummy!
Really, everything from the food, the drinks and the atmosphere was perfect.
I work in the area yet never spend time around FiDi. I decided to finally give The Dead Rabbit a shot, and it didn't let me down. I went with a co-worker, we both ordered food and drinks. I tried one of the signature cocktails, I believe The Trailblazer (has mezcal), then asked for a margarita after. Both drinks were solid, but my marg seemed very weak.. We shared oysters, they were fresh and delicious; truffle fries (perfect), and the fish and chips weren't too oily or chewy.

The history of the pub is made clear throughout, which I always love coming from long-standing businesses in NY. Staff was friendly and prompt, even on a Friday night after work. Yes, busy, but we had a great time and would definitely go back.
This place is an absolute gem. It's in a neighborhood (FiDi) that I have no other reason to be in, ever - but Dead Rabbit is one of those destination spots you go out of your way to visit. There's good reason for the wait times to get in: everything from the unique craft cocktails, to the ambiance, to service is consistently stellar.

On our most recent trip, for my husband's birthday, we went upstairs to the parlor to enjoy some after-dinner drinks. So delicious. I was torn between slowly sipping my drink (Panic Attack) to truly savor all the fresh, distinctive flavors... and wanting to quickly guzzle down all that liquid yumminess all at once.

We both ended our evening with their famed Irish coffee, which is nothing short of epic. The Dead Rabbit mixologists have TRULY nailed this drink down to an art form. The coffee- and whiskey-based concoction has the PERFECT, comforting degree of warmth, and is then topped with this refreshingly cool layer of homemade whipped cream. The pairing together of warm and cool on your tastebuds is just such a treat. My husband said this drink was like liquid dessert!

Can't wait to return. I haven't tried their food yet, and have my sights set squarely on those truffle fries.
It is telling that myself and my friends, in a brief trip to New York City -wherein one may find so many, many options for food and drink, and perhaps feel obligated to explore as many as possible- would pay our tab and abandon a restaurant miles to the north, then trudge through the cold to catch the subway down to Water Street in order to visit Dead Rabbit for a second time in three days.

The first visit was a screaming success. Holding fond memories of previous trips, we sensibly posted up on the front step a short while before the doors were scheduled to open on St. Patrick's day and grabbed one of the tiny tables downstairs before the rush hit [three separate groups were fighting over the table while we paid our tab that day]. Full Irish breakfasts and a few cocktails and shots of whiskey later -courtesy of the Excellent advice of the Lovely [and very Irish] waitstaff, I have a new favorite whiskey- we eeled our way out through the press of eager green-clad celebrants, incredibly satisfied.

Fast forward a few days later: it is no less crowded as we wiggle our way back in and get on the waitlist for a table upstairs for a late dinner. The general hubbub is enough to make your head spin if the well-balanced but heavy-hitting drinks don't do the job already, but it's a warm, welcoming feeling. The bartenders are a delight to talk to and order from- the best at their trade, they manage cheerful conversation and have sound recommendations and creative suggestions for the drinks, which can get overwhelming in the cocktail lounge [it's a brilliant menu, and an entertaining read]. The food is invariably delicious, even if you just get the crudites [tasty dip, crunchy celery, nice olives and so on] but i personally recommend the toasty. It's a brilliant grilled cheese and eating it was sort of the culinary equivalent of a hug.

Any way. I could wax on about this place for ages, so I'll stop here. I just wish I lived closer.
My husband and I popped into The Dead Rabbit on a gorgeous Sunday afternoon and we were super excited to have our choice of seating either upstairs or down. I liked the vibe of the downstairs so we grabbed two seats at the bar and perused the menu.

At a cocktail mecca such as this, I was a little nervous to ask about non-alcoholic selections, but the bartender said she could make me something based on the flavors I like. I told her I like simple, not overly sweet concoctions and I especially enjoy mules. This woman made me the most delicious version of a booze-free moscow mule that I have ever tasted! It was so smooth and tasted much more complex than a simple ginger beer with lime. I don't know what she did but it was magic!

We also decided to order the fries, which came with a few different dipping sauces. They were absolutely delicious, and the curry ketchup that came with was fantastic!

Great place to spend some time, especially if you can get there when it's quiet.
Dead Rabbit is just a step off of the fairy dock on Wall Street.  We wandered in for a drink before heading back to our hotel.  What I found out is that they are known for their mixed drinks and location was used in the movie bar scene ""Gangs of New York"" and one of those gangs was known as the ""Dead Rabbits"".  I guess someone threw a dead rabbit into their hang out.

It was packed on a Monday night, we still found seats at the bar.  Very loud music is played.  I had the Irish Coffee which was literally to die for.  Irish cream foam cap and with every sip of coffee on the bottom you got the delicious Irish cream foam in the sip.  Just awesome.  The friends with me had a Rueben sandwich or something similar to a Rueben.  It isn't on the menu but boy was that sandwich beautiful.

Only complaint is just cuz you come in as a group of 3 doesn't mean that it should be one bar bill.  I find that frustrating when 3 adults are assumed to be dating and it's my problem to work that out.  Now I know for next time to immediately say ""separate checks please!""
Awesome cocktails, main drawback is that it's a small space that can get crowded pretty easily. If you can get a spot at the bar you're golden, but might take a little waiting if you're going at a popular time.
There is a reason why this bar is recommended by almost all of the locals. The interior is nice but no air conditioning on a really sweltering summer day in the city. Only saving grace is the fantastic cold concoctions that the expert bartenders mix up. My husband really loved his old fashioned and I enjoyed the gimlet. The lobster deviled eggs were fantastic... order them... you won't be disappointed. (Unless you hate lobster or eggs)

The best part of our experience was the Irish coffee that the bartender offered to make us complementary. I don't drink coffee.. never have... but this was out of this world delicious. I absolutely loved it. They totally converted me to loving coffee... well only if there is liquor in it. ;)
Wow this place was marvelous.

I came here on a weekday night after a stressful day at work. Came here to hangout with an old coworker after not seeing him for a while, but boy was I surprised at how rowdy and noisy it was at around 11pm EST on a Wednesday night. We were lucky to even get a seat!

A female bartender helped us get situated and offered a wide drink menu. We had some of the cocktails and enjoyed the atmosphere. They only had one side open which is why it was so cramped, but not surprised since it was past dinner time anyways. They had an upstairs section that I unfortunately did not have the opportunity to view. The drinks weren't memorable but I definitely remember trying their version of the old fashioned and also sampling my friend's Manhattan.

Definitely come in! The bar as a rustic vibe about it and a very laid back atmosphere on the southern edge of Downtown, Manhattan.
I absolutely love this place. I'm not surprised this place has won so many awards. I don't drink much but had 2 Irish coffees and contemplated a third. I've only had shepherds pie a handful of times as I find it hard to find. Was feeling so happy and satisfied after this meal wanted to come back but time wouldn't allow.
Great spot and great Irish Coffee as well as specialty drinks. The food was superb and the corned beef hash was exceptional.
Service was a little slow but loved the 3 whisky bars, gorgeous.
Sawdust on the floor which you need to watch for if you are hanging your coat.

You can see why this place was voted best pub as the staff are great and a really good craft beer selection.
The bar seemed cool, but the service sucks!!! The bartender was rude, obnoxious, and racist. I have an accent...who doesn't in NY?

She ranted ""in the US tip isn't included"" when I paid with my credit card - granted tip is customary for drinks since no food was ordered - Little she knows, my intent was to give her a tip in cash. She didn't even wait for me to reach into my pocket when proceeding to demand a tip.

This poor behavior should not be tolerated and regardless of who I am or where from, there is no need for poor manners. I get it, bartending isn't fun or easy and the service industry is tough yet being a jerk to costumers isn't cool at all.
Aw man. Coming to a place like this, during the winter time, makes my heart throb (literally, the drinks are really strong!) The history of this ""pub"" as a downtown staple influences every aspect of your night here:

- The food is old school fare on steroids (super delicious with an extensive menu)
- The drinks are expertly crafted, especially the old fashioned
- Crowd is a mix of regulars, post-work FiDi folk, and everything in between

True, it is in the middle of nowhere, but that's part of the charm. Take a 5 minute cab ride uptown for your nightcap, you bum.

Places like this tend to not stay around for long, so get in while you can!
This is definitely among my all time time favorite bars ever! I'm in love with the ambiance, the hospitality, and the drinks. It's an excellent place to catch up with friend(s) but also if you want to impress a special someone.

My friend and I were initially a bit lost as we've never been this far South in Manhattan. Luckily, we were able to snag two bar seats without any reservations on a Friday night (the pouring rain outside might have helped).

Once you're inside, you will definitely be impressed as the Cuban theme is everywhere. From the decor to the menu outlining the country's history to the straw hats and floral shirts of the staff, this was a nice mini escape from NYC. Plus, you get to send a complimentary postcard to anyone you'd like before you leave!

You're welcomed with a mini frozen daiquiri which was really refreshing (dangerous though cos you could barely taste the alcohol). They also have rotating specials on their cocktail list so my friend and I opted for those. My favorite drink of the night had to have been the coffee cocktail that our bartender let us try. Everything is so whimsical and I definitely want to go back to try some of their dessert cocktails.

Each cocktail is priced around ($18) not including tax and tip though so this is definitely more of a splurge! Nevertheless, if you're in need of a treat, a date night, or a place to catch up with friends - make this your go to place :)
What a fun bar to go to and have a drink! I love the pictures all over the wall as the photos on the ceiling. I asked why there was sawdust all over the floor and I was told years ago the rabbits were around and there was no place for the rabbits to go and basically the sawdust absorbed the rabbit's pee! I went with my work colleagues and we had a nice table and we were able to talk with one another! It was a nice surprise in the middle of the Wall Street district. I had a grey goose cosmo that I didn't love- I even had the waitress bring it back to the bartender and make another one but I really didn't like it. For some reason it tastes like it had grapefruit juice in it. Everyone else ordered different kinds of beer and wine and they were happy!
This is an awesome little pub down in the financial district. They have a great selection of Irish whiskeys and a multitude of beers and other liquors. It's a very cozy little place but has awesome employees that are very friendly and pour great drinks. I plan on hitting this place every time I'm in New York.
Immediately upon entering you'll experience a very local pub feel, which is comforting. It does get very crowded downstairs though, but I understand why since the beer selection is solid and it's a local spot for most people who frequent the area. In order to go upstairs to the speakeasy portion you'll need to leave your name with the guy right by the stairs, he'll give you a buzzer in exchange.
My friend and I probably waited about 10 minutes before our buzzer rang, which is quite lucky since I hear some people wait much longer than that to go upstairs. The upstairs speakeasy does not get very crowded since it's a first come first serve, and capped after a certain head count. Their menu is a comic, which you can purchase for $5 if you like.
Cocktails are expertly crafted and are all delicious.
The speakeasy definitely does have a date night vibe to it, and would be an impressive date spot!
The enclosed booths are PERFECT for larger parties that want a little space to themselves on a Saturday night in a bar in NYC where space is so hard to come by. It sat about 10 of us pretty comfortably around the table. I was here with about 14 people and I think everyone had an enjoyable time.

I absolutely loved how dark it was in here, makes for an intimate feeling setting. The walls are full of photos and memorabilia but somehow it does not feel overdone or cluttered.

In short, I would definitely come back here and would recommend it to others.
If the music were a little softer - so you hear each other or yourself think, this would be five stars. That said the turns that they played were fantastic!
I was tapping my foot along. Which goes well with their theme of ""Craic"".
You might have to come help it out to learn more about that.
The drinks were all expertly crafted. Homemade bitters and juices. Each one by hand served in appropriate choices of glassware.
The food that was on a tray being delivered near me looked great! But alas, I had already eaten... that means I will be back to try their fare.
I was mesmerized by the collections of whiskey- scorch, American, Japanese, Irish (of course) and the tequilas(it's not Tucson, but they have some variety - and remember this isn't a Mexican bar).
They even have some Genevers listed!!!!
So yeah totally worth a return trip.
The Dead Rabbit has been on my radar for many years, but I hardly frequent the FiDi neighborhood.
I finally got around to making the trip down south, and it was a great time!
We arrived around 6pm, and spoke to a gentleman at the bottom of a flight of stairs. Apparently the cocktail bar is on the upper level, and there is a more casual bar on the ground level. We put our names down to be called and grabbed a couple beers on the ground level. The bar went in rather deep but  seemed narrow from the outside.

The bar upstairs was dimly lit and seemed rather romantic. We were seated and the server came by very quickly to get us waters.
The menu was very creative and had a really interesting design.

I can't wait to be back to try their other cocktails.
The Dead Rabbit is rated a top 50 bar in the world for a darn good reason - this place is special and make cocktails a work of liquid art. The comic book theme to their menu adds a wonderful flare to the bar and gives you a little something to explore while you choose a drink. Tables in the upstairs cocktail bar are not terribly hard to come by. You can wait at the bar downstairs and they give you a buzzer while you wait which is super convenient. While upstairs the bartenders and servers work their magic to truly make it a wonderful experience and they encourage you to try out different tastes and flavors in your drink. I particular enjoyed how they divided up the menu based off the type of drink you're looking for - lightly boozy and fruit to dark and liquor heavy. Go check it out, you're sure to have a wonderful time!
I came here the other night with a few friends and it was pretty cool.
I found out this is the sister bar of blacktail!
My friends and I had our name on the list and didn't really have to wait that long until we were seated upstairs in the dinning area.
The menu is like a book, and the further you get into the menu the stronger the drinks become.
They started us off with this warm whiskey in a tea cup! Which was super cute and the drink itself was very tasty.
My friends ended up getting the Irish coffee, straight whisky and the panic button.
Holy shit, these drinks were strong but delicious!
The service is pretty fantastic as well!

I noticed that throughout the night this place can be super busy one moment and the next it's quiet.
So be patient because this place is definitely worth the wait.
I also found out you can buy the menu book for $6!
The cocktail parlor definitely creates some of the most nuanced and beautiful cocktails I've ever had. The vibe inside the second floor lounge is chill, spacious, and a little vintage. I know The Dead Rabbit is notorious for wait times, but they make up for it with the experiences once you're seated.

I came with a party of three and we waited about 35 minutes downstairs in the saloon. The food service wasn't my priority, but everything we saw looked excellent! When we were seated upstairs, we caved and got truffle fries and deviled eggs. Both were perfect! Curry mayo with the fries was so good!

The drink menu is both a comic book adventure and a themed, categorized approach to choosing a drink. Take your time reading the story and you'll see 7 ""chapters"" of cocktails that range for lighter to heavier/boxier. Each chapter had a description like ""martini style drinks"" or ""old fashioned style drinks"". They have non-alcoholic and low ABV options plus harder hitting things. IMO, there's something for everyone here. The drinks are neither too boozy or too sweet, and each flavor (herbs, spicers, liquors) come through beautifully.

Docking a star because the bouncer at the front wasn't doing his job. When we entered, he opened the door directly into the saloon and didn't even offer us the chance to put our names down for the cocktail parlor. Apparently he does this a lot (according to other staff?), so make sure you're clear that you want to put your name down for the sit-down experience upstairs. If you're looking for a rowdier beer and whiskey vibe, the saloon is fine for that. They serve the same food on both levels. Come before 6 pm if you want a reasonable wait for the parlor. It gets busier as the night wears on.
This was not a great spot to have dinner, since the space is so small. We were crammed into a corner table where we also shares space with another table. The food was so so tonight. We had fish and chips, the black bean burger and the steak and chips. The fish was pretty good, but left me wanting for more; as did the other two entrees. The drinks came out when our meals did, which was a little frustrating. All in all, it was okay. I think I may like it more as just a bar
Drinks are real cocktails. Ambience is outstanding.
Can get a little too packed on Friday / sat nights.
My friend who lives in the Financial District talked this place up a lot before our visit so we decided we need to pass by and see for ourselves. Amazing spot! We went there on a Saturday night around 10pm and were able to easily get a drink on the first floor. As soon as we got there we put our name on the waitlist for the second floor and within 25 minutes we were seated upstairs. Both levels have ridiculously good drinks. We only got the chance to get one round downstairs, but I tried all my friends' cocktails as well and loved every single one.
Upstairs has a more upscale vibe and not a whole lot of space. We ended up getting 4 rounds here and each time a different cocktail. There was maybe one miss from a total of 12.

Hands down one of the best bars I've been to and if I lived in the area would probably be a regular here.

I'm not even a big beer drinker, but I liked all the different beers that I tried. They have a huge beer selection and delicious food. They even have a whiskey bar. I went over the weekend and they had brunch. It was back in April around Easter and they had a Cadbury Creme porter which was pretty good. I also tried a strawberry sour that was really refreshing. They have a lot of delicious pizzas. We had the burrata pizza and the margherita pizza. We also got the chicken and waffles, which is my go-to for brunch. The chicken was super crispy and the waffle was perfect. A friend joined us and ordered the rosemary fries which were really good as well. I also tried the matcha and blueberry beers which I enjoyed as well. I loved the variety of all the beer and the food and would definitely go back.

Follow my food instagram @ms_new_foodie for all my foodie adventures.


This place is awesome -- have been coming here for a few years, but has been a rock during the Covid era.

I highly recommend the Burrata and the Shishito peppers for starters, he cheeseburger and chicken sandwich are phenomenal for the main course, especially if you are looking for something other than pizza (which are all great).


I'm giving Circa Brewing five stars because the food, beer, service, and outdoor dining were all on point when I visited yesterday with three friends. We arrived around 3 and were seated outside right away. A few pumps of hand sanitizer, then we scanned the QR code for the menu.

I'll start by describing the food. Pizzas are a focus, and we ordered a couple very different pies: the Heirloom, a white pie with tomato slices, and the Boys Got Heat, a spicy pepper pizza with hot sausage. The former is lighter and succulent, while the latter hit all the savory hot spots.

We also ordered a 12-piece wings, half buffalo, half sweet tea brined. I wasn't all that crazy about the sweet tea wings, and the buffalo wings didn't blow me away either, though I did like the dipping sauce the wings came with. Our table also shared an order of rosemary french fries, a decent portion which we quickly devoured.

I got to try a few of the beers, and they were all fresh and delicious. I liked the Special most of all, and the Golden Belgian was also enjoyable. I was a little surprised how good the beer was, since I hadn't heard of this brewery before. I'm happy to have made the discovery.

Also have to give praise to the awesome wait staff. Our table was well taken care of, and we enjoyed the hospitality. The suggestion to end things with fried apple pie was a good call.

To wrap things up, I'll just say that Circa satisfies, and I hope to eat more of their pizzas and drink more of their beers someday soon.


Great service, great pizza and, of course, great beer! They have a good amount of outdoor seating available plus they just finished renovating inside which is perfect with the return of indoor dining! There is a beer for everyone on the menu, ranging from light to dark (kinda their motif). Can't go wrong with any of the pizzas either! I hope to be back!


Out of the breweries I know of in NYC Circa is definitely up there in the top 5. This is because Circa checkmarks a lot of the best qualities a good brewery should have. It's spacious, has a great selection beer, and has great service. Additionally Circa also offers great food which even the best breweries I know of often don't offer.

Unlike most breweries Circa has a lot of food and, in particular, brick oven pizza options. These are generally the biggest reason I come into Circa as they are delicious. They have a lot more variety of brick oven pizza options then I have seen in other places. You can the simple marinara/margherita options for example but you can also get pizzas with a lot of different toppings and cheese. The quality and size of all the pizzas though are satisfying.

Circa however doesn't just stop at pizzas. I see they try to spice up the menu with exotic items every once in a while and it does catch my interest. I remember getting some Iberian ham here a few years ago... it was mad expensive but it was the first time I ever had high quality ham like that.

Besides food the beers they brew are fantastic. I am not an IPA guy so I like they have a diverse, and delicious, non-IPA selection of beers. Each these beers are brewed to the strengths of the type of beer they are too. For example, one of my favorites is the Nutty Professor which has been a long time option on their beer menu. Its a brown ale which you can taste the roastyness of the beer without too much of the hops.

I think of all the breweries I know of in NYC only 1 other place may beat it for biggest floor space. The place inside is just massive and includes a restaurant area, a bar area and during the hotter seasons a outdoor region. The feel of it is fairly industrial but not grimy industrial like Brooklyn Steel. There are lots of pipes, wooden floors and big fans on the ceiling. It feels like drinking WITHIN the sanitized space where they brew the beers.... which by the way you can see the giant brew tanks near the front.

The restaurant region in particular is nice to sit at as it can be less crowded then the bar. You can also see the oven/kitchen where they make the pizzas while you wait. That is always a fun detail when eating out.

I have known Circa for a few years and my opinion hasn't changed much. It's a fantastic place to eat and drink and I highly recommend it.


Oh, Circa. You were my white whale for awhile. I came so close to coming to you several times, but alas, I feared our meeting would never occur (okay, maybe not never, but I wasn't sure just when). It wasn't until my not-so-big-on-beer-drinking buddy orchestrated a trip into Brooklyn that began right within Circa's walls that finally made it happen. Oh and I'm glad it happened because Circa is legit.

So how does a guy who doesn't really enjoy beer too often end up suggesting a brewery? Well, he took his now-girlfriend there for one of their first dates so it has a little sentimentality for him. I mean I can see why you might be interested in choosing Circa as a date spot. The interior has some nice space to it with plenty of tables/seats and a beautiful bar that starts almost right when you walk in and wraps around a bit before ending right by the brewery silos. Besides the bar, those aforementioned seating choices involve waiter service, but between the bartenders and other staff, everyone seemed pretty chill with all orders being delivered with relative quickness.

When I say orders, it's important to note that Circa is a brewery first and foremost, but they have a full bar along with a nice little menu of delicious-sounding food options...oh and pizza. Lots of pizza. Luckily for us, my buddy's girlfriend wanted to order one up and so we went for a pie that, now I look back on and I can't place it from the list of choices. Perhaps it had hot sopressata (even though it looked like pepperoni), but either way, the pizza was piping hot with just the right amount of cheese and a lovely char on the crust. We also got an order of fries which were crisp and tasty.

I saved the best for last as Circa's beer is what should bring you back (though that pizza might too). Flights are available and so my buddy and I each got one to help range out our ability to taste almost everything. They have a great variety of styles which is always nice to see. What's nicer is to taste those differences. The Guava Sour had just the right amount of pucker-up power while their Tazzy IPA was hoppy with a little fruity kick. A few others were liked by my chums (they were big on the Vin Rogue Coco Porter which I thought was decent), but the most memorable would be their winter warmer beer 2nd Helpings. It had the perfect balance of maltiness and spices that had me dying to return for more.

In fact, I did get to return to Circa recently with one of my friends, though our trip was cut short due to Circa closing early for a wedding. That didn't stop us from getting a pint each as per the super chill bartender. I went for a new brew instead of actually getting a 2nd helping of 2nd Helpings and tried their Peaches of Normandy which was a lovely IPA that perfectly balanced bitterness and peach flavor. That bartender and staff in general didn't chase us out either which was nice as we got to relax a bit until our pints were finished. This shortened-trip only adds to my desire to come back again...and maybe again!

Overall, Circa has it all going for itself. A beautiful space, friendly staff, delicious food, and (most importantly) solidly memorable brews. I'm glad I can say I've finally been so I can check off that white whale as finally being captured. If you haven't been, consider it now your own pale-colored whale and get over there to experience Circa for yourself.



My experience at Circa is a taleof highs and lows. Ultimately I liked the place and will definitely return. I enjoyed the beer and wings and I liked the decor though I felt it was too bright. The illumination feels more suited to a high school bio class than a brew pub.

My experience started when I called Circa to make sure that they were still serving food on a Sunday night at 8:50 pm. I was told that they were serving for another 30-40 minutes. I arrived in an Uber 12 minutes later (checked the Uber app for confirmation). When we were seated and I ordered some of the wings I was told that they were only serving pizzas. I was shocked. This would have been excellent information to have 12 minutes earlier. I try to eat a low to no carb diet and was excited by several menu items (wings, salad, meat and cheese board) but alas none of that was available to me.

I approached the bartender and inquired if he was the one to answer the phone. He said he was and I asked why he didn't inform me that they were not serving the full menu. He explained that he only got the word in the interim from when I had called and when I had arrived. I explained my dietary dilemma and he said that he was sorry and he would see if he could get me some wings for me. He said they would be on the house for my inconvenience. I was appreciative and thought this was well handled.

The pizza that came to our table was quite good and the wings when delivered were also excellent. When the bill came however the wings were included. I paid for them. I didn't want to make a big deal about it but it added to the up and down experience.

The menu says in big bright letters ""Dinner 5pm till close"" but that is clearly not the case. This should be indicated especially when someone calls on the phone to inquire about food. Overall the food and beer was solid so I won't ding them but one star for these issues.


This place is everything in one - chill brewery for casual drinks, yummy restaurant for any meal, and great weekend hangout. I've been here a couple times for casual beers, but also decided to host a party here with friends.
The process for reserving a larger space was very simple through yelp - I was able to easily request a date and time for a larger reservation. Since my party was about 15 people, there was no minimum to reserve a large space in the back. The person I was working with, Rachel, was super helpful in confirming the space and allowing me to order appetizers and pizzas ahead of the day. There also are several event packages you can choose from.
Every pizza is incredible, especially the velvet underground, which has burrata, pesto, and hazelnuts! I love the rotating beers here, no matter what season it is, and can't wait till my next flight.



Came here for dinner this evening and it was pretty packed around 6:30pm. Got a reservation easily and seated immediately.  I've been here before and remember the food being much better in spite of them being out of several things on the menu.
We ordered the Margherita pizza, bucatini pasta and was a dessert pizza. All of the food was extremely bland and unflavored.  The pasta was especially lacking in taste in spite of the wild boar Raghu sauce. No spice, nothing.  The dessert pizza was a huge mistake.  Fried pizza dough with Nutella and something called boozy marscapone on top. The boozy marscapone tasted like blue cheese which was a terrible combination with Nutella.  I liked this place the first time I came, but nothing this time was good enough to return for.


great pizza, salad was a little boring. great outdoor seating atmosphere too - and nicely warmed up with heater lamps


That was one amazing brunch! We got a coupon for brunch that included unlimited beer or cider for 2 hours! It was the first time for us, but definitely not the last.
The place is quite big and divided into 3 different areas. You can buy some local merchandise.
Our waiter was very attentive and polite!  He was constantly checking on how we doing.
We ordered different pizzas for food and decided to try different types of beers and ciders. The pizza was a good size for a person, we shared and everything was delicious. I really liked the beer, that they make: from fruity to the stout ( which you feel is still ""young"", but not bad).

We had so much fun here



GREAT spot. I took a date here a couple days ago and the service was excellent. We sat at the bar and ordered a couple drinks, followed by an order of chicken and waffles and one personal pizza. The bartender was kind, attentive, and energetic - exactly what you want in a bartender. Since it was my first time visiting, I asked him what his favorite menu options were, and he was very quick to make several recommendations, which my date and I both eventually ordered. The drinks selection was a very good size, and the menu was quite comprehensive as well. I would definitely come back to this place. It's great for a date spot or just to hang out with friends. Highly recommend!


Fantastic Brewery in the heart of Brooklyn. It's also a pizzeria that serves lots of yummy food, so you can eat, drink, and be merry. I came here on a Sunday afternoon and it was fairly empty. There was no wait for a table and the servers were very attentive. I started off with an avocado toast (as pictured) that was yummy and filling. I also got some of the focaccia and jam. I'm not entirely convinced I was eating focaccia since the texture was a little different than what I was used to, but the jam was still very good.

I wanted to a try a lot of different drinks, so I went with the tasting size of the Summer Ale which wasn't bad, but I didn't love it. I then tried the Nutty Professor and the Banana Pancakes Porter. The Porter was definitely my favorite drink that I tried. The flavor was great and it wasn't too hoppy. The Nutty professor wasn't anything super unique, so it didn't stand out that much to me. Definitely want to try out their pizza the next time I come here. It looked really tasty!


We came here for a brunch the next day after an awesome New York wedding in August. We started out with a mimosa and Bloody Mary. (Mimosa was refreshing and needed for the recovery. Haha).

I didn't get the chance to take a photo of the brunch table for the list of options that they were able to provide to us.  We had different pizzas served to our table and a brunch table that had french toast (and toppings) and the classic sausage, bacon, and egg breakfast.  All was honestly delicious and very filling!

In addition to the meals, we got to do a quick brewery tour by Drew.  He made it interesting and showed us his knowledge and passion for brewing this deliciousness! haha.  We also got to try some the wheat (? I think that's what it was... it's hard to remember after 2 months have pasted).  Anyways, it was a pretty good snack haha.  I didn't have room to drink any full glasses but I had a few sips here and there from my husband who tried out some of their beers.  Very good!

Overall, positive experience, friendly staff, and great knowledge on brewing (thanks Drew!).  A spot to check out in Brooklyn!


We got a table immediately. The decor at this restaurant was something new that I had not seen before. The style can be described as Urban. Pipes and beans scatter the roof and walls , while the tables are a made from nice solid wood- making the whole place pop.

They have a huge selection of beers and ciders. The restaurant brews their own beers on the premise. I tried a rose cider which was perfect for a fall night. The cider was a mixture between grapes and a cider base. It was delicious!

The pizza menu was also pretty extensive. I am vegetarian and I had plenty of options to order. I ordered the Marinara Pizza. The pizza was pretty big, came up to about 6 slices. The pizza was divine- hot and cheese.

I would highly recommend this place for a great night out.

I came here for a yelp event forever ago and had a great time so when it came up on Pulsd I knew I had to come back. They do a bottomless brunch with an entree + $25 for AYCD beer and select ciders. With the Pulsd deal it was $50 for 2 people.

We ordered the Boys Got Heat (house-made spicy italian sausage, tomato, roasted pepper, fontina, mozzarello, parmigiano) and the Shroom (wild mushrooms, mozzarella, smoked idiazabal, farm egg). I liked the Shroom a ton, which is surprising because I'm not usually a big white pizza fan. The Boys Got Heat was great, but nothing too original. Both are around $21 on the regular menu and are a good, but not overwhelming, single portion. Crust is phenomenal, which everyone knows makes or breaks a pizza.

As for the beers, I'm not sure how frequently they switch it up so unsure if this will be helpful. We tried a bunch (they do flights for bottomless! Amazing!!) and my personal favorites were the West Coast Red and the Double IPA. The Summer Ale was phenomenal - not my style beer, but gotta admit that it was great for what it was. Even ordered a second. Only mediocre beer was the Orange Pale Ale. Wasn't bad, just boring.

Outdoor seating is great, inside also beautiful. Pristine bathroom. Great service. All in all, a really great brunch and I'm glad I came. Cheers!


Great spot to relax and have beer. I went here for a brewery tour with City Brew Tours and I was very satisfied and happy with my experience. The place had this very chill vibe and they have a lot of great beer. I had samples of three kinds: Cherry Revision Wheat, Slim Pickings Session IPA, and Ph/DH Guava Sour. The IPA was really good. I like hoppy kinds but this one wasnt that hoppy and it had a smooth citrusy flavors. I never heard of this place before and it's in an area that you wouldn't expect it to be. It's in a busy neighborhood and you'd usually see breweries in Desolate, warehouse areas. They brew all their beers there and keep most of it in house so you wont really find them at a bar or supermarket.


Came here for brunch on a sunny Sunday around noon.  When we initially walked in the place was on the quiet side but filled up as the afternoon progressed.  We are not beer connoisseurs but the waitress kindly made recommendations based on our taste for other drinks and she was spot on!  We started out with the Shaksbury Rose which was really great and something I look forward to buying as well as the Lovelythebeer Strawberry Sour which was also awesome!  To eat we had the gem lettuce salad, quiche, and burger.  The salad was very fresh and had a great dressing! The quiche was surprisingly light, which I appreciated since I usually steer clear of quiches because they tend to be heavy.  We topped off the meal with the flourless chocolate cake a la mode.

Overall, customer service was great and the space is really nice!  I also really appreciated how knowledgeable the staff was about their beverage offerings.




I was so impressed with Circa

There was an elite event here, which I sadly missed (damn grad school, you'd better be worth it). Needless to say, when my friends suggested grabbing brunch here, I was all in, as I had heard great things. It did NOT disappoint. First of all, the feel this place puts out is fantastic. I love all the wood, the size, and location of the bar, the open-ish kitchen, and that huge fan. It only got better when our amazingly cool server came by. She explained all the beers they had running, and what the boozy brunch includes (two hours aycd tap beer, and a few canned ciders). Then she left us to it, not bugging for time or orders, just asking if we wanted more beer. Pretty much a dream brunch if you ask me, laid back, friendly, and no huge rush to get in and get out.

When we did put in food, I was told to get a pizza, as they are amazing, but didn't listen and went for the burger instead. Rookie move. It's not that the burger is bad (not mind-blowing, but not bad), its that the pizza is that good. Seriously, the breakfast pie was awesome, thankfully my fiancee (who is much smarter than I) got it, so I could try it.

Come here for brunch, bring your friends who have babies, and just chill for a few hours with the cool folks who run this place - you won't be disappointed.


Food is good but expensive. Pizza is probably not worth it but I do like the honey pizza. Beer is what you come for and vibes.

They have games, TVs and good atmosphere. Beer is really good and so is service.

Love Circa Brewery and have been here a couple of times so far. This is probably one of the fanciest set ups I've ever seen for a brewery space. You have some kind of urban industrial chandelier, steampunk fancy shine going on with huge ceilings and just an enormous open space. The service I've had every time has also been super attentive.

I'm going to jump to the chase. Drinks: I haven't explored much on their cocktails but can say I've tried several of their drafts at various points in different seasons. Right now they have both a Cadbury's Porter and a Pina Colada Porter that speak to my heart. Sweet, but not insanely so, with a slight bitterness. Belgian beers, Irish stout, their berry berliner weisse, goses, saisons, kolsch's. They've mixed up the menu here and there over time and there are now so many new brews being made it's hard to keep track of but I'm usually fairly impressed. You can do individual tasting pours or full pours or opt for a flight which I like because then you get a nice variety of everything. Most of everything is accurately priced. Drafts are $7-8 and tastings are $4.

I've tried some of their food at both a Yelp event and on my own for their brunch. They do a bottomless deal for $25 as well! Their pizzas are pretty great but I think I'm more of a fan of their dinner time pizzas. I still really enjoyed the Lox pizza (super fresh salmon) and the eggs benedict pizzas but I'm going to say this lovingly - more cheese is always a good thing. Also thought the benedict pizza had a whole poached egg on it or whole eggs and it was just hollandaise and maybe scrambled egg cooked into the pizza. Pro tip that I should have gone with my gut and done this: Order an additional burrata cheese ball thrown onto said pizza.

Do order their steak and eggs. The steak is insanely good quality and cooked perfectly and comes with a decadent cheesy gruyere hash brown thing. Do order their burger - made with quality ground chuck meat. This sucker was dripping and definitely my favorite thing I've tried food wise here. Their dinner pizzas are impossible to mess up. The boys got heat, salumi, and hawaiian pizzas I remember being really really good. They're shareable and decently sized but I would say if you are starving you may want to order two pizzas between two people. Also, the flourless chocolate cake is sinful. Everyone is pretty chill here. Not too many hipsters. More like middle aged hipsters and some families with babies. I definitely look forward to more Circa brewery time as its in a convenient location half-way between my work and getting home.


I came here for a friends birthday a few weeks ago and was impressed by the space, staff and drink/food. They have a large floor plan, with options to reserve a space off to the side for a private party. They have a variety of beers, while also offering cocktails and ciders. While I didn't eat, the menu options were appealing which can be rare for a brewery. This place is definitely worth a visit!



Very spacey modern-looking brewery with plenty of choices that should satisfy even the pickiest beer critic.

Try to sit at the bar, which has super comfortable seats.

Beer flights (4 beers) go for $16 ave are well worth the price.

We also got their flourless chocolate cake, but were turned off by its microscopic size: for $8 you'd expect something bigger than a dessert of the size of a small plum... it felt like a scam.

Overall, go for the beer, but forget about the food.


We all know how much I love brunch and how much I love pizza so when boozy brunch was proposed at Circa brewing with the group, I was pretty much sold. You don't hear about many boozy brunches with beer and cider so it made the experience all the more unique. We sat down at a nice round table and were introduced to the menu. We had the whole beer list to pick from and the top three cider choices (all from Ninepin, a cider place in albany that I recently had visited!). I got the rose to start then followed it up with the original (which I stuck with for a while). I was able to sip on all the different beers that Chuck ordered and I loved them all too.

From the second I walked in, all I could smell was delicious pizza carbs. I knew that I wanted, nay--needed, a pizza for my meal. It is what they do! I was torn between the bacon and eggs pizza and the boys got heat. I went for the breakfast pie and really enjoyed it! They even have a little bottle of infused chili oil on the table and I dumped some of that on to add heat. My friends got a few other pizzas and all of them were delicious (slice swap ftw).

I definitely plan on coming back here. The food was great and the beers were all so flavorful. It was such a relaxing brunch that we got out and decided to just take a nice long walk (to go drink a bit more).


Pizza, beer brewed in house, a spacious aesthetic with lots of tables (endless, honestly), and nice staff. This place has it all.

I've been here on a few occasions and have gotten pizza every time, along with a variety of beers that they've brewed right in the restaurant. My latest favorite was a matcha IPA. Not too matcha flavored and not bitter, both surprising in the best way.

The service has been good every time, and the waiters check on you often to make sure you don't need anything else. Plus, they don't rush you out, which I appreciate.

This is a very laid back spot to hang out with a couple friends or a large group, and even a date night (especially if you sit by the entrance -- it's cozy and a bit quieter!).

Great addition to downtown Brooklyn.


If you're craving beer and pizza, Circa Brewing is the place to go. It is located in downtown Brooklyn near Brooklyn bridge, dumbo, and Brooklyn bridge park, great neighborhood. I got the Hawaiian pizza, to my surprise, it did not have tomato sauce but was still amazing.
Since Circa brews their own beers, we had to try it. We got the Match T-IPA and the Belgium Dubbel. Both were refreshing and goes really well with the pizza. If you go early (3PM-6PM) you can catch their Happy Hour deal: $5 drafts, $6 wells and $7 glass wines.

The interior of the restaurant is also top-notch. You can tell they pay close attention to detail. From the wooden barrels outside to the large brewery machines to the large body mirrors in the bathroom, Circa Brewing did not disappoint.


Pretty surprised with the size of Circa. The super cute entry way has covered outdoor seating, not something you see much in the Fulton, BK area.  First things I noticed were the spaciousness, high ceilings and literal brewery behind the bar. It was beautiful. There's a sense of minimalistic and functional use of furniture and decor. There were barrels with table tops as a seating option up front by the bar, I'll sit there next time, for sure.

Reviewing the menu took some time because really everything on the menu sounded like it deserved to be picked! Luckily Alex (waitress) was ever so kind and helpful to recommend her topic picks, which by the way I ordered exactly what she suggested and I was stoked it was just as good as she described. She gave us a couple option and flavor descriptions along with great drink pairings. She was awesome, honestly. We ordered the Burrata & Prosciutto, 62' Hawaii (black forest ham, charred pineapple, mozzarella, aged provolone, black salt) and Aubergine (roasted eggplant, confit tomato & garlic, green onion, fresno pepper, shaved root veggies) along with cranberry margheritas. I've never had a cran margherita before, it was as refreshing the sun shining after a light spring rain shower. Kudos to the bartender (whom I didn't catch his name).

The 62' Hawaii pizza didn't have sauce, that's a first for me. Great choice! The melted cheese was creamy, soft and oozing with flavor from the charred pineapples and prosciutto. Talk about finger licking good. I could have kept eating BUT I thought why not have this flavor explosion again for lunch the next day and saved some. LOL! The staff was super attentive, but not overbearing, fun friendly, and helpful.

Oh for the trivia lovers out there, this is the place.  The have trivia on Mondays, I think (don't quote me, call and ask). I'll definitely be back to try more of their pizzas and you should too!


Industrial and rustic... yet polished? Circa Brewing is the hipster manifestation of everything the media ever promised you about Brooklyn, with a little 9-5 nod to all of its clean cut customers who work in downtown Brooklyn and indulge in pizza and maybe a little too much alcohol after work...

Conveniently located near Jay St - Metrotech, Circa Brewing truly offers the best of what Brooklyn has to offer when it comes to pizza and drinks of a boozy nature, whether you're craving a beer brewed in-house (decor +1, drafts +1) or a cocktail. Bear in mind that this is a pretty hip place in Brooklyn, so cocktails will be $12-14 a pop, and yes, if it's Friday night and you've had an especially stressful week at work, they WILL add up. (For those gin fans out there, opt for the Spiced Pear Fizz and not the Root of the Problem. The latter was far too earthy-tasting for me.)

With gargantuan pizzas hovering around the $20 pricepoint, Circa Brewing is truly the place to treat yourself. To avoid too much sticker shock, talk yourself out of eating the entire pizza and save some slices for lunch the next day, though I'll admit that this plan quickly fell apart as soon as I realized how delicious The Choke was. I was slightly forced into ordering it as it's one of the few veggie pizzas on the menu (even as a staunch blue cheese naysayer), but excuse me if part of me will always demand that my pizzas come with sweet drop peppers from now on.

And even though you'll dread looking at the bill at the end of your meal, take the extra minute to carefully review the items on your receipt. For some reason, they were unable to make the original pizza I ordered and the server forgot to remove it from my bill after I changed my pizza order. Had I not realized, I would have been out an extra $20 for a pizza I didn't even eat.


I just love circa brewing. Came on a Tuesday after work with a friend that hasn't been there before. She was impressed with the place and I was happy because I kept bragging about it.

Decor and ambience
Those big barrels of beer never stop to impressing me. Love the booths, high stools and the long tables. The open kitchen give that level of transparency where you just know the food must be good.

Drinks
Last time I was here my friend ordered a flight of beer and I always wanted to do that. This was the grand opportunity. I got the Keller Kolsch, Pilsner, Blueberry and the lovelythebeer. They were all good but  the Kolsch was my ultimate favorite. It was soo good. Refreshing and crisp. The blueberry was my least favorite.

Food
Love that they update their menu once in a while so there are new things to try everytime. This time we got the Boy's got heat and Shroom Pizzas and they didn't disappoint. They were fresh and delicious. The boy's got heat has a really nice kick without being overly spicy. I really loved it. The shroom had different kind of mushrooms. It was earthy and and the egg added creaminess.
Brick oven chichen wings were really good but the sauce it came with was finger licking good.
I don't have words to describe how good the burrata and prosciutto was. It was so good I had to order seconds.

Service was amazing as always. Our waitress was so sweet and attentive. She suggested we saved some of the burrata for our pizza. To eat it with the crush and she was abosultely correct. Thanks for the tip! Now I have to do that every time.

I can't  wait to come back on a weekend for brunch.


Very nice bar/restaurant/hang out place in downtown brooklyn. (4 1/2 overall)
Drinks (4)
Even though their happy hour special is not big, they have an awesome variety of beers, ciders, wine and coctails.
Food (4)
Pizzas are delicious. Tried the margarita and hawaii, both really good. Live the naming of their pizza too. Very cool, creative and original. I definitely want to tray the 2 cows, one sheep and one goat pizza. Sounds amazing lol
Ambience/decor (4)
Amazing plan to get together with coworkers after work. Nice decoration and cool vibe.

Our server was very attentive. They have this ipad where he enters your order as you're ordering and quick checkout for your tab. Technology!!!!

We ventured out to Brooklyn for a brunch. I was excited about this spot, as it is a fully functioning brewery. We don't drink often, but we certainly enjoy drinking quality beer, wine, cocktail and everything else tasty!

The first glance at the entry way had that ""wow"" factor, with large, simple yet modern and cool light fixture with a fan, greeting the customers. From the entry way, you can see the big & shiny beer brewing equipment to the right.

They brew all the draft beers here, so we wanted to try them instead of cocktails. They had an option for a flight of beers, so we decided to do that. We chose Pilsner, Belgian Golden Strong, APA, and Porter. They were all very tasty, high quality and flavorful. We enjoyed all of these beers. Great job!

For food, we got Boys Got Heat Pizza, Chicken & Waffle, and Rosemary Fries. I must say, the pizza was much bigger than I expected, which was great. I don't always eat pizza crust, but their crust was tasty! It was charred just a little to add the great smoky flavor. It was not so spicy, but had a nice kick to it. Chicken & Waffle was huge too, and the chicken was super crispy on the outside, which gave that great ""crunch!"" noise. And the fries...oh the fries...it was freakin' amazing! We were completely full and happy, we took some food home with us.

We had a really pleasant brunch here, everything was delicious, and I thought it was all very affordable too, considering the portion and quality. Our server was lovely and friendly, polite and helpful with recommendation. What a great spot to get some food and booze! And it is not a typical restaurant, but a brewery! I love to go back to try more of their delicious food and beer offerings!


********UPDATE*********

I came back here with a friend to sit down for a proper dinner, and they definitely redeemed themselves.

To start, our server was fantastic and helped us make a choice from the wide range of beer selections.

I love that they put a bottle of olive oil with a hot pepper in it on each table!  For starters, we ordered the burrata and prosciutto, which was delish.  And the little gem salad, some greens to make us feel better about ourselves - delicious.

Then, we ordered two pizzas:
- The Velvet Underground, more burrata, loved it
- The Shroom - My favorite - could eat this every day.

Definitely a great experience this time.  Will be back for sure.

Came here on a Tuesday night around 9:30. Sat at the bar for ten minutes while I watched the bartender work. No one greeted me. At one point, she made eye contact with me and kept working. She then left the bar to deliver some drinks and walked right past me and didn't say ""hello"" or ""I'll be right with you."" I'm normally a bit shy to go out by myself, but when I do, it's usually the chats with the bartenders that make it worthwhile. I've never felt more invisible. Very disappointed. I heard the pizza was good and I wanted to try it.

Drinks: Large selection of beers on draft and made in-house! I tried a few including the Matcha TIPA and a blueberry flavored beer, though the Matcha was my favorite which was refreshing and smooth. They definitely have very unique and creative flavors for those beer fanatics! There are other drinks options including wines and cocktails, but the beer is so good why choose otherwise? They also have weekday happy hour $5 draft specials (M-F 3-6pm) and brunch specials including a bottomless drinks option for $25 weekends from 11am-4pm.

Food: I only tried a few items including their pizza and fries! They have a bomb burrata pizza available for brunch, but all their pizza are coal oven cooked and personal sized, why only order one? If pizza is not your thing, they have several other options including chicken and waffles and tons more!

Vibe: Large and spacious with a brewery feel to it. Very casual spot which is perfect to hang out with friends after work or during weekend brunch. Plenty of different seating arrangement available including bar side or spacious booths. It can also be a great date spot if you are in the Downtown Brooklyn area!

Service: Great attentive waitstaff who were always available whenever we needed anything!

I had such a fun experience here! Below you may see a review by Koma S. (maybe it has been removed?). I just want to say I overheard that interaction and the description written is not reflective of Circa's service! The employees were attentive, the server was fast, and the food was exactly what I was looking for (the daiquiri is..... a must...... get a double shot--you won't regret!).

So I go to this place with my Son, Daughter-in-law and granddaughter based on a review from Local One and we were totally amazed with the place and food.  Rachel our server was the best and deserves a raise. Her A+ game was totally on and we enjoyed her advice tremendously...
The Salumi Pizza was amazing and MiaMarie enjoyed her burger and Rosemary fries.
BURGEROLOGY is next.

Ok, now I feel bad about all the times I've walked passed this place!

Came here for lunch and Julie was my waitress (she's bomb AF). I was in the mood for pizza so I opted into the Shroom pizza. I never had pizza with an egg on it so I was up for the challenge. I was going to get the 6 inch and Julie suggested the 12"". So happy I listened!

First of all... The pizza was FIRE and I'm not talking about temperature. Everything about it was what I expected in a great pizza. Cheese was settled in mounted over the crust, mushrooms were seasoned to the point I was getting rotisserie chicken vibes, and the egg was an added complimenting touch.

Let me tell y'all something. Food is good when you think about it as much as you think about your lover. I say that to say, hey lover! ;-)

P.S. - I didn't get to get any beer but I WILL be back so no worries.


Circa Brewing is rally great place for huge selection of beers. My friends and I are had a great time at Circa brewing. I didn't taste different kind of beers but it was really good the beer that I had.

The environment of the place was great very big and the staffs are so kind enough. If you are looking for a chill this is the perfect place. I had really great Margarita pizzas. It was so good. It should be the first thing you should order because this place looks very busy and takes time to get some food. The pizzas which they makes it's brick oven cooked pizza

Coming to this place is so easy. Subway stop just a block away I cant wait tog back there and have mire pizza and beers.

Thank you Circa.


As deceiving as the name of this place sounds, it is more than just a place to have drinks. I came here for lunch to check out what they had to offer besides drinks. Up until 3PM they serve lunch. 3-5PM they serve only pizza and 5PM and on it's the dinner menu.

I got their bolognese calzone and I'm pretty satisfy with it. It's not worth the price that they're asking for in my opinion, but still was good. I also got a Chai Stout from their beer menu and it taste like what you would imagine, a rich dark beer flavor with a hint of chai. This is definitely known for their beer on draft and I bet happy hour is popping.


Locating Circa Brewing in the heart of Downtown Brooklyn amidst the shopping district is a must if you're craving an open, inviting space with Craft Beers and good eats. Circa is located on a quiet block away from the retail madness. Walking on Fulton Street you will absolutely miss it, but once you turn on Lawrence and walk mid block you will instantly notice it. Upon walking in you're instantly transported into a Spacious, elegant Beer Hall with ample seating by the bar and dining area. On this particular occasion, we were immediately greeted by the Manager and given the option on where to sit. We were seated in the dining area perfectly situated right across the bar. We were amazed at the detail taken into bringing this space to life. Circa Brews all of their Beer on site, which ensures the fresh, cold, crisp offerings they currently stock. The Beer options often change, which is a clear indicator that they are on point in ensuring they employ quality and variety with their selection of Beers.

The options are plenty based on your desire - so when it doubt go for the sampler, which offers 4 selections and several options to choose from. We decided to go for the following : Helles (smooth, crisp and refreshing),  The Belgian beer (Light, Citrus, Smooth), Buzz IPA (Full of flavor without being over powering and smooth to the palette) & The Stout (which was lighter and more pleasant than most Stouts I've had)

For my main meal I decided to try the Gruner, which was also smooth and less 'Peary' than some Sauvignon Blanc's which I generally tend to go for.

On to the food selections: For appetizers, we decided to go with what has to be THE BEST Brussel Sprouts I've had to date. They were Crispy, full of flavor and topped with a thin yet fulfilling spread of Lemon Aioli, Breadcrumbs and peanuts (hold the peanuts if you're allergic). They were served in small pot which ensured they remained warm and retained their flavor the entire time. To compliment the taste, we chose the Cheese and Meat selection which included a blue cheese, a brie and Idiazabal cheese. All three were served with Guava and Fig along with Bread for spread (see what I did there ?:) My personal favorite was the Blue Cheese which exulted a mild sharpness all while retaining a smooth delectable taste. This paired particularly well with the Guava as it gave the sweet and sharp contrast to excite your palette. The meat selections included an assortment of Prosciutto, Salami and Ventricina.

As full as we were, I really wanted to try the Pizza as I've heard these are definitely something to write home about. We decided to go with the Salumi which included Sopressata, tomato, Fontina, mozzarella, garlic, honey oregano. The flavors blended together nicely with the contrast of flavors. I'm a cheese lover and this was everything I thought it would be. The flavors are not overpowering and provide an enjoyable and shareable meal that was satisfying to the taste.

While the experience was the utmost enjoyable solely based on drinks and meals, it was all made exceptionally enjoyable thanks to our server Ciara. She greeted us with an upbeat, jovial and inviting disposition. Throughout the entire meal, she provided suggestions, some of her favorites and joked around with us and provided pleasant conversation. She even swayed us into returning for Brunch for which we will absolutely check out.

Thank you Circa for a wonderful experience...Looking forward to coming back!




Stopped in for a flight and was greated by a friendly bartender. The brewery beers were a nice variety including sours, ales, ipa and dark beers. I didn't have lunch there but the special looks like a good deal as does the happy hour. They also do an all you can drink brunch. It's a fairly large space so it's great for groups.



Circa has a bunch of brewing machines on display. They brew and serve their own beer so you work find a blue moon or Coors light served here. I'm a big fan of the Nutty Professor. The decor is really nice and classy and feels just like any other beer garden outside of NY. Its really hard to find a beer garden within the city so this one is special!

This was my first visit to Alamo Cinema and I'm mad at myself for not enjoying here sooner. I took an Uber to the cinema and was a little lost but once I entered the building there were signs directing you to the top level for the theatre.

My date was on time and was just as shocked at the gem - Alamo Cinema. I bought the tickets online and chose our seats. So we were not stopped when we started our way up the escalator. We came to see Queen and Slim.

When we entered the theatre there were three ppl at the door showing you to your seats and where to locate the menus.  yes ! We ordered simple drinks; I had a frozen margarita and chicken with fries. The order came while the movies was showing but it wasn't an interruption since they took the credit card to start a tab. The server came back to ask if we would like fresh popcorn - oh hell yeah! Thank you Alamo You've made me an official fan. Next trip will be with my kids.

My friend and I really wanted to see a movie in the city and there are so many choices.  Many of which have absurd prices and should be shut down (looking at you regal union square lol). So we found this place online and she told me it was probably like the one in Yonkers near her and i would did it.  She was totally right. So it's quite possible that this is a 4 star instead of a 5 star because Ik spoils by going to Movie Tavern in Syracuse.

So the main issue I have here are the seats are just not that comfortable at all and are extremely aged. MT has full reclining seats and adjustable tables while having a stadium seating effect too.  So without all of those accommodations I can't give this place a 5.  The food is also the most expensive food I've ever seen at a dine in movie place. It's sad because it they were just 3-4$ cheaper I would have tried the food and I'm sure that there are many others like me.  Being successful is about pricing appropriately.  The staff are also kinda short tempered.

So that was a ton of complaints I know, but it really is a fun time. The screen is decent, they serve blue sky soda which is a huge perk, and the movie ticket price is very fair. This is also in a good area In brookyln so you will feel safe too.

I recommend coming here next time you want to see a movie.  I would recommend going to eat before coming though.

The concept of having a meal and watching a movie is harmonious. Alamo isn't the only game in town but it is one of Brooklyn's original.

Beyond having the luxury of a served meal at your seat you also book tickets (and seats) in advance. I can't go to the movies any other way. Long gone are the days of getting there 30+ minutes early to get the right seats for you and your family. Now you do this in the app or online and roll in just as it's about to begin (you can even arrive a little late if you don't mind missing the trailers and funny ""don't text here"" announcements).

The food is high quality and there's brunch and lunch options. There's also some yummy cocktails you can order. I'm partial to the bloody Mary's and the dark chocolate shake with vodka or tequila - amazing!

I've always dug the vintage vibe they have here with retro posters and speakeasy style bar you can hit Pre-show.

The only thing holding them back from a top 5 stars is that over the times I've been there they are hit or miss with service. We've ordered things that haven't arrived and it's a little difficult to flag them down during the movie (even with the system of leaving your card up to attract their attention). Things happen, but they weren't apologetic about it nor did they provide any compensation. Lastly, and good to know for families, they didn't want our 4 kids (all 5-8) sitting in the row in front of the adults. They claimed it was some policy which annoyed me and was BS. Other than that, it's a solid place to catch a flick.

We decided to check this place out. It's been open for some time but we never got around to go. Parking was a hassle. However, the trip was totally worth it. It was a really nice experience. We ate at the DeKalb Market so didn't get a chance to eat here. They do have a pretty decent food and drink menu. The seats did not recline which was kind of a bummer. Service was great.
Prices were reasonable. It was nice and quiet during the movie, which it always should be, however not always the case. They have a bar that you can hang out until the movie begins. Make sure to be there on time or they will
not let you in. I recommend purchasing tickets in advance. Overall, we enjoyed ourselves.

I moved to NYC from Austin so was so excited when a Drafthouse opened! I hadn't seen a movie at a non-Drafthouse in over 10 years for a reason. Love the pre-show clips, the service, and the giant bowls of popcorn. Besides my own home, I hate to see a movie anywhere else!

Love this place.  The fact that they are really serious about people not texting and talking during the show is good enough for me, but the fact that you can get food and drink (including booze!) in a comfortable seat makes this an excellent movie-going experience.

I've been here twice and enjoyed it both times.  The beer list is really good with an extensive selection of NY State drafts.  Craft cocktails are tasty too.   The food is hit and miss.   My chips and queso was ""meh"" and my pepperoni pizza was good but way too greasy.

Service has always been great.   I have to say, I'm a fan.

I have always wanted to try those bistro and movie type places and I finally found my go-to movie spot. Although it is in Brooklyn, it is easy to access if you live in Uptown Manhattan. The train stop takes you directly to the mall/movie theatre building.

The place is really spacious and clean and the customer service is by far the best I have seen so far! The first time we went here, we had a mix up with our tickets/movie theatre and they accommodated us at the bar and provided us free movie tickets for our next visit and got food at the bar complimentary! They really did the right thing by securing a loyal customer by turning our initial experience around. I had the pretzel and queso and chips from the menu and it was so good. The food is high quality and the seats are spacious and comfortable. Kudos to the manager that night for turning our evening around and for accommodating us despite the mix up!

If you come early or want to hang out after the movie, there is a bar on the first floor that you can hang in. They have loud music so not really a place to converse. You can also check out the Dekalb market with all the foodie spots if you want something else.

The second time I went, I had the popcorn, a fruity beverage, and the queso and chips again as I crave that spicey queso dip from time to time!

I will be a frequent movie-goer to this location because of the location, the service, and the experience. I highly recommend going to this place!

Came for an 11:15pm showing on a Friday night with a group of 8. Large theater with drink/food option delivered right to seat. Tickets checked at seat which was different and also nice. Ordered a margarita on the rocks which was not good. Had the largest and most buttery bowl of popcorn I've ever had.
They have a crazy strict no talking policy that borders on absurd.
Movie experience itself was fine.. good volume, lights etc.
price is steep and the food/drinks aren't cheap either. It's easily a 100$ excursion. I don't come to the movies often so can't say this experience convinced me to change my way.

It's a really good cinema. It's more expensive than other cinemas.
1. The cinema have waiters walk through to take your orders. Food orders are written on cards and left on the table. My server took a long time to get my card and when I tried getting another server to help he ignored me.
The seats are roomy and comfortable

I came here to watch a movie on a Sunday morning.  The theater is actually on the 4th floor in the City Point Shopping Center.  You have to write on the ordering card what you want and then stand the card up in the railing.  The tables on the seats were large but you can't move them.
I ordered the breakfast flatbread pizza ($14).  The portion was larger than I expected.  The pizza was delicious and crispy.  The food was pretty good.  The food was better than other eat-in movie theaters like CMX Cinebistro, iPic, AMC Dine-In, etc.  The service was pretty good too, there was always a server who saw the card up.  The only thing I didn't like was that the theater wasn't dark enough.  I guess it's for safety reasons since the servers have to look for the ordering cards and deliver food.  I did appreciate the lights under the tables though.  FYI - if you're a Victory rewards member, you get a free movie ticket on your birthday.

If a new movie is out, I pray they're showing it. Always an enjoyable experience. The waiters/food prep could be a little quicker but I get it, it's usually a packed theater.

The Parmesan truffle popcorn deserves 5 stars alone.

This is such a great theater!
My husband and I have been coming here more and more for date night since I'm heavily pregnant and more active activities just aren't on the table right now (ie museums etc). We've been able to see so many interesting independent films, animes (yes, we're dorks), and regularly playing ""Hollywood"" movies as well. This Friday we're seeing E.T. and the week after we're catching a 1970s Kung fu flick. For me, it's great since Netflix is so prolific it's nice to see something different or special in some way. Not to mention they serve all kinds of theater treats and snacks, meals, drinks and (for those who aren't imbibing at the moment) really tasty milkshakes : ). The staff is always great, too - polite, helpful, and willing to shush the odd talkative or giggly table. I'm so glad I live right next to this place. I even heard that they play ""family movies"", which is just regular movies an adult might want to see but not as loud so ppl bring their babies and don't have to worry about getting childcare or being embarrassed if they cry or whatever. This place kind of has/does everything if you're a cinephile.
Definitely download their app so you can keep up with their screenings and book in advance because tickets often sell fast. (But don't worry, you can get a refund or rain check if something comes up, how great is that ?!)

I. LOVE. THE. ALAMO. DRAFTHOUSE

This place can get all my money!

One of the many things that I love about the Alamo Drafthouse is the reserved seating--I want to know that I don't have to get there super early in order to get a seat. It's actually recommended to reserve your seat because oftentimes than not, they sellout of seats. Another thing that I like is dine-in feature. I've ordered several dishes from AD but I love the avocado toast. The chips and queso was good as was chili cheese hotdog. The flatbread was nothing memorable. I highly recommend the key lime pie milkshake (with or without rum).

AD is extremely strict about not using cellphones and talking loudly. They will kick you out--I mean, you spend almost $20 on the movie and then spend money on food, why waste time with the phone in your face? More importantly, why distract me with the lit screen from your phone?! Anyway, you try it, they'll warn you, you try it again, they kick you out. I love it! Also, you got to get there before the last preview is shown--they don't allow late entrants.

I'm so spoiled that I really don't want to go another theater.

We have been coming here at least once a month over the last couple of years and we like it.

The concept is very attractive though its not new any more. Some don't like having food along with a movie - the servers may be distracting, the sound of people eating whole meals may be annoying.

But for me and my wife this is about as comfortable as it gets. We get to have a full meal and get a movie out the way while we watch. We are not connoisseurs of movies to such a degree that we can't stand the slight interruptions.

Their truffle popcorn is especially good. And so is almost everything on the menu. One gripe is they give ketchup in an open small paper cup. And this is prone to being spilled - as evidenced by my stained shoes from a couple of months back. But that is likely more because I am clumsy and not representative of what others experience.

Shoutout to the creative 'turn off your phones' messages at the start of movies.

Love the concept of being able to enjoy a meal and a movie at the same time.

Tickets are about $17.50/pp. meals/apps range between $8-$25.

I got the bbq wings (6wings) and my friend got the hotdog which came with fries. They were both good ! The prices are a bit much but i mean ... for the experience, what do ya expect?

Drinks / Beer also offered.

I do think the seats area a bit small so it may be something to consider. Overall, a cool date night or chill experience. Must. Go.

Today I visited this theatre for the first time and  I truly enjoyed the experience. I ordered my tickets online , and I made sure to pick seats that were connected by a little gray line online so that I would be sitting next to my date instead of a stranger. After purchasing my ticket I went to the theater where I was only asked for my ticket when my waiter came to take my order. The lobby is full of books , action figures , toys and a plethora of books. One book that caught my interest was the history of various depictions of Black theatre art. Asides from the interesting literature the movie theatre follows a system . Patrons aren't allowed upstairs until an hour before the movie starts . Once it's time to for your movie of choice to start then you are allowed upstairs. There are many theaters on the second floor. I think eight theaters to be exact . I had the pleasure of watching a movie in theatre four which was spacious comfortable and had a large amount of space for leg room . The menu at this theatre is extensive and well priced . I ordered popcorn , the trick or treat cookies , barbecue wings and a root beer float which all came up to 45 dollars including tax. The food was great! The movie and surround system was great. The bathrooms were clean and very well designed . All of the staff members were very kind and accommodating ! I had a great experience at this theatre and I will definitely return .

PS there are bathrooms on both floors and in order to order food you must write your order on an index card with the pen connected to the table and place it in an area that is visible to your waiter.

I was eager to check out this dine in theater after hearing about it for a while now! It's upstairs in a shopping center so if you need to wait for a film you can check out target, etc. before or after while you're there. My friend and I decided to hang out at the bar inside the venue. They have a happy hour every day which is great! And you can even take your drinks with you into the theater. They have some crazy wax figures, some of which are pretty graphic!

The theater has assigned seating so make sure to book in advance or get there early to get a good seat. Even the last row still has a good view since it's really not that far back. The seats are very comfy and there are small tables between each set of seats where you can look at the menu and place orders. The staff come by and pick up your written order and then bring it out to you during the film. You can keep ordering during the movie as well. I found the prices a bit high but sharing something is a great deal. We went with the grilled cheese that comes with fries and it was good! Pretty decent portions.

I would definitely come back here since it's very easy to get to. Right off the Q train at Dekalb.

My wife and I really enjoyed our date night here. We enjoyed the food, drink and service provided. The wings were delicious, sweet Thai chili. Right amount of sauce and loved the char crunch on them. Our drinks were excellent, loved the many selections available. And their popcorn beats any other movie theater, evenly distributed butter and not greasy. Sound system was great. What my wife and I really liked was the very strict rules they enforce regarding talking, texting and cellphones. They will boot you out, no refunds! Kudos because we really enjoyed the movie without any jabbering in the theatre. Little on the pricey side but well worth it. Because of the strict rules, I don't recommend bringing very young kids here. Try it out, you'll enjoy yourselves. We sure did.

I LOVE this! I wish they had this upstate. A movie theater with table service! You can order food and drinks, the alcohol kind, and enjoy a movie while enjoying your lunch. The food was good. I ordered the popcorn with clarified butter. It was a nice sized bowl too so I shared some. I don't normally share my popcorn either.

I also ordered the blackened chicken Cesar salad. Nice sized bowl chock full of Ceaser salad ingredients and chicken. Paired with a nice cold Pilsner (all local beers on the menu!), it was perfect.

The service was quick, accurate and impressive! You fill out a card and pop it in a slot and they come by and take it and bam! Your food appears within 10 minutes.

I'm sure we in upstate will catch on to this fun way of going to the movies!! Hurry up already.

I've been here a few times, so I figure I should do a review!

Service: I tip my hat, and my wallet to the servers. They have to do their job, and be sure to stay out of the way of the audience, and they do just that. Be sure to tip them, being all sprinty and bending over constantly, just thank you servers for being so awesome and friendly.

Food: The food has always been super tasty, and the drinks PHENOMENAL! I had a rose milkshake, and I've been raving about it since.

Inside: The bar and stores are super fun to look around and find some odds and ends gifts (obviously a tad marked up, but its new york- it's business).

Con: ONLY complaint, is that the chairs don't really recline- so you kind of move around a lot to get comfy, and as most theatres it's chilly- but I tend to have a small blanket (literally child size) with me and no one seemed to care!

Went here for their Clueless movie event on September 12,2018. This was my first time ever going to an Alamo theatre.
Location: This is right inside of the complex where Dekalb Market, Trader Joe's and Target is located. The venue has a bar that looked super lively that you can go chill in and not need a movie ticket for. It also has a set of nice restrooms right there on that main level. The theaters are up the escalators in the lobby area that a part of their gift shop. There are also larger bathrooms up the escalator.

Protocol: Once you get in the theatre you can find your seat and sit. I found their numbering system a bit confusing so I asked an usher/waitress who checked my phone and instructed us on where to go. If you know how to find your seat alone when  the waitstaff comes to you they will verify you have a ticket and then take your order.

Menu: Fully extensive you can skip eating before you get here because you can have a seriously filling meal here. All we got here fries which were tasty.They also serve alcohol so you can get your drink on! The drink list is extensive as well.

Movie experience: The seats are very comfy and there doesn't seem to be a bad seat in the house... unless you're in the very front. I was in the last row seats 3&4 and we saw perfectly. It's stadium seating so no ones head was in my way! If you get cold easily bring a sweater or something because they spare no expense with the ac... maybe it's to keep the people who are boozing it up comfy.

FYI: After the previews, the screen announces that from that moment on it's a quiet theatre and anyone who is talking will be made to leave with no refund. No texting, no talking, no laughing or heavy breathing- okay I made up the last two! They also state if there is a loud table near you notify the staff aka snitching is now acceptable behavior in Brooklyn! This was a highlight of my experience because I hate talkers, texters and commentators at the movies. I'm happy to report that no one violated the rule and no ones phone went off during the movie! HURRAH!

Overall: I would definitely come back here for another movie in the future, but not too often since their prices are steep!

Alamo is great theatre in the heart of downtown Brooklyn. It's on top floor of a huge building which felt like a mall & it could be...I'm just now aware of it. Either way, this was my first time going to the theaters by myself & I truly enjoyed it. I went to see Spider-Man: Far from home and high was good by the way. You have the options to order food from your seats which is a nice touch. Comfortable seats & very spacious which are the two main factors for me in a movie theatre. They both were checked off so I have nothing to complain about. Will be coming back for sure whenever I'm in A mood to watch a movie in Brooklyn next time

I'm sure the movie theater experience is pretty good with all the four star reviews I am reading about. But we showed up for a screening and as the advertisement for the screening said to be one hour early. Exactly what we did. We stood on line with a bunch of other folks and waited an hour before the line started moving. Pretty much about two dozen people at the end of the line was given t-shirts and turned away because the movie we came for is full to capacity. Yup, my group was one of them. And they ran out of t-shirts. LOL. Terrible.

So, the solution was we put our names on a list and contact info on a sign up sheet for the next screening. It's been several days now and no follow-up. Customer Service seems nice but that doesn't provide a solution.

Anyway, we did check out the theater a little even though we did not catch a showing and it seems like any other movie theater. It is a small theater with leather seats and each Screen has an attendant. It also has elevators and and escalators.

The lobby has a couple of electronic kiosk to buy tickets and you can buy tickets with seating selections online.

I would consider returning to the Alamo Drafthouse. But for my recent experience it wasn't a let down at all but not good.

8/13/2018Andrew,
Sorry you didn't make it in last week. That was actually a private event hosted by a movie studio and was advertised as first come, first serve. We worked with them to get as many people into that free screening as possible, but ultimately we were at capacity and there just wasn't anything else we could do to accommodate the rest of the guests. But, I'd still love to help you out. If you're interested, please email me at mike.sampson@drafthouse.‚Ä¶ and we'll get you taken care of.

Went to see Uncut Gems. This is my second time here at the Alamodrafthouse. It's a 3 minute walk from the 2 or 3 train. Cozy theater, it has that old school feeling to it. Nice decor. The movie was shown in theater 6. I picked seats all the way in the back. You can sorta smell the stench from the prep station where they dump out liquor, beer and cocktails. That's the only downside. But the theater itself was clean. Seats are alittle small. The service was great. This is my second time ordering a chocolate chip cookie shake and both times it came out excellent.  The items on the menu are very pricey but if your not in the mood for the food from the cinema,  on the lower level of the city point mall theirs a food court with tons of food options. I would definitely come back!!

Conceptual it's such a great idea. The idea of eating and having alcohol beverages from a restaurant menu than buying overpriced snack food is a phenomenal idea. Our waiter was great he explained how it worked. You simply write your order on the sheet of paper and place it standing on your table. There's a tiny light under you table to see.

Positive: The food was very good. Shockingly good. Not like a movie theater good but restaurant quality good. Waiter was great guy.

Negative: The wait staff walking around giving bills. I don't understand the arriving 30-45 minutes early rule- it makes the process extremely strenuous. On top of that wait, they showed very awkward previews. Lastly the floors were very sticky.

My favorite movie theater! If you're looking for a movie theater where you want to watch the movie, eat and drink in peace. This is the place to go. Their food is awesome. Their drinks great. The Parmesan Popcorn is oh so great! The best movie theater in Brooklyn!

I've only had lovely experiences here.

As many others have mentioned, the process of buying online tickets and redeeming them is very, very simple. As in, the last time I went and showed my phone screen to the friendly guys at the front desk, they glanced at it and told us we could head right into our theater where our server would check them again once we sat down. That's it.

It's great to not have to weigh the decision of waiting in line for snacks upon arrival and very easy to order anytime during a movie. Big fan of the fried pickles and milkshakes.

What I like most about this theater, though, is that although it's located on an upper level of a recently developed/very modern shopping center, the design team clearly made a concerted effort to make the theater feel truly...lived in. In a good way. Like the difference between the feeling you get staying in a room in a boutique hotel or Airbnb versus a sterile, uniform corporate chain kind of situation. It just feels like it's been there for awhile and it's a charming effect.

Moral of the story: very into this place.

Disclaimer: I'm judging this based on a private viewing where we rented out a theatre for our large group for a school event (~35).

Before this visit, I didn't realise I had actually been here before, on a random day when my partner and I were just avoiding the cold of downtown brooklyn 2 years ago. Flashforward to now with a school group, I was preparing for the worst - sticky chairs/armrests, shoes sticking to the floors, bed bugs in the seats, the smell of farts in the air. To my surprise, none of the above.

We went to guest services and the manager who was taking care of us came down shortly - he was extremely professional, courteous, and patient with 30 teenage children who were all itching for different things.

Our package came with unlimited fountain soda and pizza. I was imagining a stale slice of Costco Kirland off-brand frozen pizza microwaved, but we were actually served individual flatbreads each. I was THOROUGHLY impressed with this, though looking at the menu I was a bit taken aback by the prices - $10 for popcorn, $12 for pizza, etc. While I do expect the concession stand to be exorbitantly priced, these were incredibly inflated. However, we were given a headsup from the manager that should our children decide to buy anything, we needed to be wary because of ""hidden surchages"" - tax, and an automatic 20% gratuity fee for services garnered in our private viewing theatre. I appreciated the full transparency from their staff, and it made me really trust them.

The experience overall? Impeccable. I'd definitely come back here with another group again, and am interested in coming with friends/partner. The only thing that worried me a bit was that after one student got a wrong drink order, it took them about an hour to get the correct one in...Also, the ""unlimited fountain soda"" was a bit of a disclaimer because after the initial taking of orders, no one ever came back in - understandable, to give us privacy upon viewing, but they were no easily reachable outside the theater either.

This review is for vegetarian and vegan people! Alamo drafthouse has reasonably priced and tasty food for a movie theater. They also have a separate vegan menu and non junk food options such as kale salads and tofu quinoa bowls! The popcorn was somehow the worst of the options see below for breakdown:

Truffle parmesan popcorn: unfortunately the popcorn was semi stale and I was not a fan of tons of powder on my popcorn.

Prezels with queso: Awesome and flavorful queso.

Southwestern Tofu quinoa bowl: tofu was well seasoned and tasty! The top of the bowl was flavorful but the quinoa itself was bland. Could have used a bit more seasoning and veggies.

Grilled vegetable sandwich: Best item of thr bunch was surprised at how fresh bread and veggies were and how great it tasted. Highly recommend.

Such a cool movie theater experience!

What makes this place cool: They have so many menu options, including a wide variety of draft beers, cocktails, and spiked milkshakes. Comfortable seating and ample leg room. There is a waiter for each section.

Things to note: Early arrival is highly suggested. This will allow you to get your food right at the start of the movie. There's no entry after that movie has started. Additionally, this theater follows a strict no talking/ no phone policy while the movie is playing.

Overall, Alamo Drafthouse is definitely a nice way to switch up your movie going experience. While I may not become a regular, as this can become a pricey movie going experience, I look forward to coming here again.

It was a great Mother's Day outing. Amazing Bloody Mary cocktail. Unexpected, salted rim. I loved this twist
Deviled eggs and Flatbread to snack on!
I mean who orders Deviled eggs at 10.30am...

I saw Avengers Infinity War here. I'm familiar with the Alamo Drafthouse Cinemas having lived in Austin, TX.

I enjoyed my experience. Parking is sparse if you're driving here just FYI. Thanks guy a the ticket desk was pleasant enough I had purchased my tickets in my app so I didn't need much interaction besides where to go for my theater.

The lobby was well decorated. There's a backdrop of the city where you can take pics. The theater was very clean and the seats was comfortable. The menu could have a bit more option imo, however the appetizer menu is good if you just want to snack instead of eat. Of course  if you like beers the Drafthouse aspect will compliment your taste for that. The food service was quick and non disruptive.

I'm looking forward to coming back bere.

P.S. the movie was awesome that help too! That's my spoiler free review.

P.P.S there's the DeKalb Market Hall. It's pretty much a food mall. If you want to do dinner and a movie the economical way with way better options. I recommend to watch the movie and then head to the basement after to choose from at least 20 eateries!

I love Alamo and their concept. The idea of an intimate move theatre works for me every time! And you can order your food, drinks and snacks as you're enjoying watching the movie. We've discovered this place since we moved to Brooklyn 5 months ago and my husband loves coming back and biking the front toe seats with the recliners. It's actually quite ok. Food is alright and their milk shakes yum!
I've taken away one star for the overpriced gummy bears and popcorn that made me sick once because it's so buttery... but maybe I'm just not used to that.
Flat breads are tasty though.
Also their movies selection is slightly more unconventional and they like to bring back the good old classics.

I've never been to a Drafthouse Cinema so this was cool for me.
As we walked in I kept asking ""but where is the popcorn?""

Note well: DON'T BE LATE! I was late by about six minutes my first trip here and the sign on the door almost had me in tears. ""Late policy: NO THEATER ENTRY ONCE A FEATURE HAS BEGUN."" I was well and truly early the day after I can tell you that.

Staff was nice when honouring seats for the next day. I guess they understand all too well the trouble getting street parking downstairs.

The experience was nice. I went to see BP and coupled with very tasty wings, popcorn and beer, I had a wonderful time! The servers were on point too. Almost cute as they darted through and fro during the show with backs bent as they proceeded to tables to retrieve orders from us without interrupting the movie.

Oh, no talking or texting. Yes!
Also, try not to get too close to the screen (especially if you wear glasses or suffer the occasional vertigo. It can be tricky.

I'll definitely be back.

The End.

My favorite movie theater to go to in Brooklyn. Big, comfortable chairs; available food and drink; plus an easy-to-get-to location.

Being as popular as it is, getting tickets can be tough. Multiple times I have stopped over only to be turned away by sold out shows (thankfully there's an eatery downstairs to pass time). However, the process inside is simple - get to your assigned seat, use the lights under the table to look at the menu, write what you want on the placard and leave visible in the space provided.  Draft list is fantastic and reasonable prices at $7-9. The popcorn ($8) is also solid - a heaping pile of buttered popcorn served in a giant steel bowl. My last visit, tried the Jerk Chicken Sandwich ($14) - a hunk of seasoned chicken on a potato bun served with sweet potato pies. Loved the veggies and bun, but the chicken was a little dry. Sweet potato fries are good.

As long as you don't mind servers running around (they do their best not to disturb movie watchers), then this is a great place to see a show.

I can't believe it took me so long to review this Alamo. I've been an Alamo Drafthouse fan since I first discovered this wonderful gem in another state. When one opened up in Brooklyn I thought it too good to be true.

I love everything that Alamo Drafthouse stands for.  No talking, no unaccompanied children, no cell phones, no disruptive people. Also there's a full menu of food and drinks. What more could you ask for from a movie theater?

The food is always good (but don't come here expecting 4-star cuisine, that's not the point), the seats are comfy, and every seat in the theater has a good view. Unlike other theaters that try to cram tiny seats in every available nook and cranny, the Alamo sets the screen far enough back that even the front row has a pretty good view.

Thank you for coming to Brooklyn, Alamo. Please never leave.

Haven't frequented this bar in a while. Forgot how good the drinks were here. They had a nice layout outside. Shout out to our waiter last night (Jelani) for dealing with our large group. He pointed us to all the good stuff and kept us aware of the time.

We came in 5mn before the kitchen closes and managed to order their crispy Brussel Sprouts (Amazing!)
For drinks, I started out with their namesake the Clover Club. All ingredients that I love : Gin, dry vermouth, raspberry, lemon and egg white. I could sip on that every night. My friend enjoyed the Mediterranean Mule (Grey goose vodka, Montenegro, strawberry, ginger, lemon, soda). Lovely tall drink!
I moved on to the Clever Girl (Old Tom Gin, lemon, raspberry, blackberry, vanilla, prosecco). I found it to be a refreshing and festive cocktail.
For the rest of our group, the bartender improvised and made a Kentucky Derby with whiskey, raspberry, lemon & soda. It came out strong and super well balanced.

Really love the fact that you can taste the quality in every sip of their drinks, plus the food is awesome!

Came for brunch at around 1 pm on a Sunday and there was no wait for a table for two outdoors. My boyfriend and I shared the duck hashbrown and fried chicken waffle. I also had a frozen pina colada, which was perfect. Out of the dishes, the waffle was my favorite. Homemade chips were amazing.

Next time: I want to try the deviled eggs and more cocktails!

This review is so simple to write. Nothing complicated. I just think $15 for a drink with less than a shot of alcohol is absurd.

I was so excited to try this place. Yesterday I ordered one of their hot drinks. I'm 5'2, a lightweight, and can easily get tipsy from a glass of wine. I did not feel the alcohol in the drink one bit- just sugar water. Will not be going back as there are too many great bars in the area.  Not that I order drinks to get buzzed, I could have just gotten a tea for $3 somewhere else had I known. (insert emoji shrugging shoulders here).

Got delivery from here tonight. Looks like they still have some kinks to work out on the delivery menu/offerings, but it was ...okay. Portions were small- I normally have a very small appetite, but had no problem polishing off their steak frites ($25) and crisps ($8) by myself. Crisps were amazing, the standout of the night. Fries were good and homemade- albeit all fries suffer from delivery. (Photos of both chips and fries taken before any were eaten.) Steak was a great cut, but absolutely abolished by the amount of black pepper on it. Like it made my nose run. I didn't envy my mom and friend's eating situations with their burgers- these were multiple napkin affairs, and my friend gave up after her bun dissolved. Was hoping this would be a place I'd want to head to in person after this mess, but it looks like it's one I may be crossing off the list instead. $100+ tab for 3 with no drinks/desserts, I think my expectations were a bit higher.

From what I've read, Clover Club is considered by many to be one of the best cocktail bars in Brooklyn. This past weekend, I also learned it's a fine spot for brunch. And I'm not just saying that because they serve duck hash... okay, maybe I am. That cozy atmosphere extends to brunch as well, as does their list of interesting brunch cocktails, combined with some boozy coffees which made a first drink choice more difficult than I expected. I eventually went with something called an Afternoon Buzz, which was probably a foreshadowing of the rest of my day and evening.

The food came out really quickly. The duck hash was not chunks of meat and potato as I might have expected, but more like a giant patty almost the size of the plate, topped with a fried egg and two spicy sauces (I think a sriracha and an aioli) with the colors looking deceptively like they had added strips of bacon on top (such a tease). But a thumbs up on the pancakes, some of the best ones I've had at a restaurant in a long time.

While I agree that some spiciness is goodness, that doesn't mean extra spiciness is better. I could have done with a bit less of the sauces to let the flavor of the hash speak for itself (meaning I had to scrape a bit off). My dining companion, who does enjoy her Bloody Mary a bit peppery, also commented that she felt her drink was too peppery.

It was great to dine here, and now I'm looking forward to a return visit some evening for more.

My partner and I stopped by here the other night because it was cold out and they have hot cocktails on the menu. By the end, we had tried every hot cocktail there was, and they were all delicious. I can't remember their names, but the one with Mezcal was my favorite. We also ordered a steak appetizer and crab dip - so so good! We're looking forward to coming back and having a proper dinner.

Beautiful atmosphere, highly recommend for date night/first date. It a big bar yet intimate and quaint with candles on all the tables. They have a very reasonable happy hour that I took full advantage of. This place is elevated bar food, I loved the chips with tangy creme dip.

I would discrediting humanity if I don't address their breading pudding. It is ridiculously good. It has a subtle sweetness. Honestly could eat this everyday for a year and be happy. Make room for it!

Ooh, I have been here twice in the last few months and have enjoyed myself each time!

Loves:
+ The drinks. Everything is good. Their booklet is also the cutest drink booklet ever as there are caricatures of the staff inside!
+ Food is good. Some of my faves include: mac & cheese ($15), fried chicken ($20), spinach & artichoke dip ($11), and crispy brussel sprouts ($13).
+ Their sister restaurant is Leyenda but let me tell you, it feels like 10x easier to hear people in this place.

Not so love:
- The seats near the door, lol. I wore my winter coat throughout dinner because I was still that cold.

Even though this awesome place is in my hood I cannot visit her all the time because I don't always feel like paying $50 for dinner, but when I do feel like having a #treatyoself moment, I know Clover Club is here to help this girl out! :)

Fancy drinks with specialty cocktails
Ordered the coconutree holy grail
This place has a Really nice vibe
Ordered some food to try
The grilled octopus was not that great
too much beans and not enough octopus to ate
Those hot chicken sliders were spicy
Felt like it's missing some fries since it's pricey
Overall this place is classy
So dress nice and be glassy

I did an event at Books Are Magic last month and more than one person suggested getting drinks at Clover Club before heading over to the bookstore. I go to a lot of readings and really appreciate a good bar within a short walk of a bookstore. These bars are not only great default hangouts for reading-adjacent events, but they tend to be in fun, walkable areas, and appeal to the exact yipster nerds who voluntarily spend their evenings listening to authors talk about books.

We met up at Clover Club at around 5:30 on a rainy Thursday and were able to get a table for five with ease. The place never felt empty, but it stayed pretty calm the whole time we were there. I liked the dim, speakeasyish ambiance and decor--a set-up I've definitely seen before, but one that I tend to enjoy. Service was decent, though I might have ordered a second drink if our waiter had checked on us a little more often.

I'm pregnant, so I wasn't really drinking in any case. The cocktails all looked delicious and I watched with envy as my friends drank them. I was happy to find a selection of zero-proof cocktails, at least, and ordered the Before Sunset, a refreshing, sweet and spicy drink with ginger, pineapple, lemon, lime, and jalape√±o.

Clover Club also has food, so we shared a few snacks, and I got some sliders for an easy dinner. We got the salty and sweet spiced nuts, the deviled eggs, and the spinach artichoke dip for the table. I liked the deviled eggs--there was an assortment of them with different things on top, and I'm not sure which ones I ate, but they were tasty. The spinach artichoke dip was great, served with house tortilla chips. I didn't try the nuts, but I assume they were fine. The hot chicken sliders were solid, with buttermilk and cayenne-marinated chicken finished with herb aioli and house hot sauce.

I had a swell time at Clover Club and will probably come back any time I visit Books Are Magic. It's a comfortable bar with nice atmosphere and lots to drink and snack on. Hopefully next time, I'll be able to drink the actual cocktails.

Stands the test of time! I'm cringing a little at the review I wrote in my 20s (I was a food critic, apparently), but I'm glad to say that I've never stopped coming to this amazing place!

In all the years I've visited, I'm quite sure I've never had a bad drink. My companion, a cocktail fanatic, is totally gaga for this place, it's like a kid in candy store. Always a treat.

They got a new food menu somewhat recently and it's excellent! Just the perfect place to go, all around. The staff are so professional, the ambience is so cozy, especially in the winter. What's not to love??

Never change, Clover Club!!

We stopped by this gem on a rainy Saturday afternoon for some upscale daydrinking. The back room with the fireplace was perfecly cozy and warm. I had a few Colletti royales and my bestie stuck to NY sours. Both were delicious, even to sweet drink haters like us.

We ordered the lamb burger with crisps and a side of potato cakes. The burger was delicious, though kind of unoriginal (flavored with cumin, topped with goat cheese.) Sometimes it's better not to mess with what works, though. The potato cakes were absolutely blah. They were served cold and they were super dense and not too flavorful. The creme fraiche they came with was great, but it didn't quite go. It was much better with the crisps that came with the burger.

For the price of drinks at this place (and the amount we tend to consume) I think we will definitely go for the punch bowl next time. It claims to serve 4-6, but I think that's just their opinion...

I came here on Sunday night for dinner and it wasn't busy. The place was very dark and we sat by the window. It's good for dates or large groups. We ordered several cocktails and plates to share. Prices were average. Service needs improvement.

Oysters - Overpriced, tiny and very briny. I wouldn't recommend.

Spicy PEI Mussels - Delicious. It's not actually spicy in my opinion. The wine broth was so buttery and great for dipping. Don't be afraid to ask for more bread!

Crisps with duck fat and truffle creme -Soooo addictive but extremely heavy and greasy. The flavors of duck and fat and truffle were strong and worked very well together.

Cocktails - Very good and nicely crafted. My favorite of course was the Clover Club.

I came here for a quick drink while waiting for a table at the sister bar across the street. Come here and not there.

Their drinks were inventive and great. I thoroughly enjoyed my drinks to the point where I almost missed my table at the other bar as I was taking a long time to savor them.

We ordered a quick appetizer of artichoke dip that honestly came with maybe 10 chips. Odd how restaurants think it's normal to eat dip like a soup considering you run out of chips with the first half of the bowl. We asked for more chips and were not told there would be a fee. They sorted it out but it's odd to not let us know about that.

However, the service was great. The host was so nice and accommodating.

The space itself has that hipster vibe to it, bar with tiled and wooden accents and speckled with antique-looking functional furniture.

Definitely coming back for that matcha cocktail.

This place is all around, fantastic! From the service, to the food, to the drinks -- so good. We tried a few things on the menu and all of them were delicious, so anything you choose, you won't go wrong. The mixologist makes great cocktails. The waitress we had was SO kind and delightful! Really just do yourself a favor and go! Can't wait to go back soon. This is definitely a place I would like to go to at least once a month.

*Drink review only*
Some of the best cocktails you might possibly ever drink can be experienced at Clover Club.
I've visited Clover Club several times in the nearly 11 years since it has made Smith Street its home.
The d√©cor is very inviting and sexy with a speakeasy feeling allowing it to stand out among other businesses along Smith street. Perfect for a date or hanging with friends.

I'm sure I tried some bites when I visited in the past but my memory doesn't serve me well since it has been a while. As such, this review will focus on my recent visit whereupon I enjoyed their incredible cocktails.

Although we sat at the bar, there were plenty of tables (albeit occupied) and I think a back space through velvet curtains. Considering it was a Saturday evening, it was super crowded and the place where everyone wanted to be.

Because I arrived first, i was able to get acquainted with our bartender of the evening, Ryan, who carefully crafted and curated some of the most visually appealing cocktails (and mocktails) at record speed.

It was actually enjoyable sitting at the bar since it was adorned with all the necessary cocktail essentials--variety of bitters, beakers containing an assortment of mixers and a gorgeous herb and fruit/garnish display. Note, Clover Club is fully stocked to include an assortment of whiskeys, gin and vodka according to brand but for those who are beer/wine lovers, they've got you covered.

Their cocktail menu was thoughtfully mapped out per category such as Sour drinks, Tiki style drinks, Gin and more.
My head spun. That's when I closed the menu and allowed Ryan to decide for me. He was spot on after I told him my preferences--- I started out with the Green Giant drink.

Too pretty to drink, the Green Giant was a combination of Old tom gin, sugar snap peas, tarragon, lemon, dry vermouth. This had the wow factor, served over crushed ice and very refreshing. I typically do not drink Gin but this was a mellow variety and I felt it was necessary to keep the integrity of the drink intact rather than substitute vodka for gin.

My next drink was the Sun kissed Sour. Since I was seeking something different sans crushed ice, Ryan suggested this drink especially after I emphasized my fondness for spicy drinks. This was Chili-pepper infused blanco tequila, watermelon, lime, blanc vermouth, pink peppercorn. Between the two cocktails, this might have been my favorite. It was extremely delicious and definitely had that spicy kick to it. My final drink, Gypsy Rose,  was actually a mocktail. As the menu mentioned, at zero proof, it was a combination of Elderflower, strawberry, grapefruit, lime, soda. I'm a huge fan of Elderflower, both the liquor and non alcohol variety. Very smooth and delicious.

Some of the other drinks served to us were the Tokyo Drift which was a whiskey cocktail, an Old Fashioned made with Bourbon and a straight single malt whiskey. No complaints with these.

As we enjoyed our drinks, the incredible aroma of food, which was brought to tables and those at the bar, looked quite good.
Four hours and $120 later, we left satisfied, satiated and imbibed delicious cocktails at Clover Club.

Elegant, super chill, wonderful drinks/food make Clover Club a must visit establishment.
Absolute winner.

I came here for brunch on a cold, rainy day. Seating was quick and quarters were tight. The service was fast and, if not friendly, helpful and quick.
The food was pretty good although their selection was mostly limited to egg dishes. I had the eggs and gravy dish because they were basically out of everything else I wanted and it was pretty good. I would recommend this place and I would come back but I wasn't totally wowed or anything.

My hubby and I threw a baby shower in the beautiful private Parlor Room in the back of the Clover Club and we had a very good experience.

Pros:
- Beautiful, elegant, and tasteful space with 1800's decor and furnishings. We didn't want to just rent a regular office space and this venue really stood out
- No hourly/day space rental fee!
- Attentive and friendly staff. We worked with General Manager Justin and Susan with all logistics and they were always responsive. Our bartender Ashley was super outgoing and friendly and my guests all really liked her.
- We ordered Deviled Eggs, Cheese Board, Cured Meats, Pulled Pork Minis, Caprese Crostini, Stuffed Mushrooms. All the food was fresh, flavorful and came out in a timely manner. Our friends raved about the Pulled Pork Minis and Caprese Crostini.
- Wide variety of fun and delicious cocktails and mocktails.

Cons:
- The minimum gratuity starts the time your party starts. So if you wanted to order a round of drinks for your friends who helped set up earlier in the morning, that would not count towards the minimum. Our bartender was sweet enough to allow an exception and set it up once she got the bar ready
- If anyone wanted to order additional dishes from the regular menu, you have to move out of the Parlor Room and dine in the front dining area, which is frustrating because you don't want to leave the party

Details for Parlor Room (Sun-Thurs/Sat Afternoons)
- 45 people max capacity for private parties.
- The requirement is $300 guaranteed minimum gratuity on all beverages. This means a total bar spend of $1500 assuming guests tip 20%. Drinks can be rung as a cash bar (each guest pays for their own drinks) or open bar (host to pay the entire tab.) At the end of the party, the host must guarantee that the minimum gratuity on all beverages reaches $300 or that the difference is met from cash bar tips. All drinks are rung based on consumption.
- Food orders, and signed food contracts are due one week in advance of party. Please note that food is subject to 20% service charge, which does not apply toward the gratuity minimum on beverages.
- Saturday & Sunday afternoon events must be cleared by 6pm. You can get there as early as 10:30am to setup.
- You cannot use anything that punctures any surface, also no glitter, confetti, stickers, and no duct tape (or equivalent) on any finished wood.
- Tall ladder is supplied but not tall enough to reach the ceiling. Tall enough to reach high up on the walls though.
- Must supply the source and speakers if you want to play your own music at a reasonable volume.
- $25 cake cutting fee covers two small-to-medium-sized cakes or one really big cake. There is no fee for desserts like cupcakes and cookies, and they are happy to arrange them on one of their platters.

Food Details
- Recommend ordering 2-3 platters of stationary hors d'ouevres, plus the following amount(s) of passed hors d'ouevres.
- 4-5 pieces of passed hors d' oeuvres per person is considered light eating. 6-7 pieces per person is considered medium eating. 8-10 pieces per person are considered heavy eating, or enough for each of your guests to call a full meal.

Finally, we ended up spending $1096 for food (medium eating), $115 on bar gratuity difference (in addition to $175 for drinks to treat our friends who helped out). Everything came together, everyone had a grand, well-fed, and drunk time and I highly recommend Clover Club for private parties! Thank you Justin, Susan, Ashley, and staff for helping us host a wonderful and memorable baby shower!

I was highly disappointed in this place after seeing the great reviews. I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the bacon tasting (really tasty), huervos rancheros (average at best), egg sandwhich (very tasty) and the criossant french toast (very disappointing. had some type of lemon batter. not your typical french toast that you expect).

The service was awful. Our waitress was incredible rude the entire time. We were sat with no silverware, brushed off when we asked for milk and sugar for our coffee, and very inattentive. Every time we spoke to her it felt like we were inconveniencing her from her job. Highly disappointing and not a great experience.

Stumbled upon the Clover Club around brunch after visiting the amazing bookstore, Books Are Magic.

Clover Club's baked eggs were amazing and reasonably priced at $13. The toast was very fresh and great for dipping in the baked eggs.

The portion looks small via the photo, but it was a lot more filling than expected. Service was great and very efficient. If I'm in the area I would stop by for brunch again.

I come here all the time and have had almost everything on the menu. It's all so good! Drinks are really well-crafted (especially the pina colada and watermelon tequila drink), and be sure to order any specials. My favorites are the shrimp and grits, spicy crab dip, the squash tart, anything with a waffle, and the duck poutine. The new fall menu is awesome. The staff is really nice, always wear masks, and it's a really nice spot.

Super cool and high-class cocktail lounge in Carroll Gardens with a massive and incredibly inventive menu, great happy hour specials ($8 cocktails) and phenomenal space. Right across from and owned by the same people as my love Leyenda - both differing heavily in atmosphere but rivals in quality.

There's a huge selection of whiskey-based cocktails which I love as well as a ton of hot cocktails. I started with one of their happy hour cocktails which was good, can't remember for the life of me what it was though. Next I tried the ""Sage Ya Later"" (manzanilla and East India sherriesm mezcal, plum syrup, honey, Cynar, burnt sage) at $14, which was great and STRONG. The menu is in this hardcover bound booklet which is cool and Dead Rabbit-esque.

Physical space is awesome. Super ornate bar with a beautiful and romantic back room and some side tables. Service was okay but oddly slow, especially considering we were there on a Tuesday when there were maybe 10 patrons total in the bar. The cocktails take a while to make but something still felt odd about the service.

All in all, will definitely return.

Nailed it! One of the best improvised old fashioned!! The aroma is a treat to my olfactory senses. The place has a cool vibe to it. We took the small plates and the food has a delicate flavor. The staff is very warm and friendly.. Definitely recommend this place:))

Can't comment on the food here but the drinks are great and well thought out. The staff is very friendly and patient and will help you pick out a drink if needed. Service is a little slow due to the fact that each drink has some sort of garnish on it and they are served with not your typical straw and ice cubes. They have good specials during happy hour so that would be the best time to go. Good choice when looking for drinks in my neighborhood.

Cocktails Bar + Brunch Place? Yes please.

Me and the brunch crew are always checking out places in park slope. For a change we went to caroll gardens. Cafe Luluc next door was incredibly packed. When we came in, our hostess brought us to our our cushy, leather booth.

The decor of the place makes you feel like you drifted into a 1950s classy saloon. We all ordered cocktails. I highly recommend the coffee blends.

The food here was exceptional. I had the potato pancakes, and baked eggs with leeks. The potato pancakes are a nice twist to having hash browns for the morning! Also, we shared the baked clams and assorted bacon. I highly recommend the bacon.

Will have to come back for their night food! Cheers!

The only thing I'm disappointed in is not coming into this place before.
Tonight was my first night and it almost definitely won't be my last. The blue velvet lived up to its name - smooth and...""blue"". Flavors well balanced and tasty!
Bar staff (Mauricio and Ash) were super friendly and welcoming - the best part of it all!

Work in the area ..so of course, i Will be returning!

UPDATE: Returned the next day (tonight) for dinner and was blown away - again. Service was on point - Pedro was a great addition, alongside Mauricio. Steak frites were bomb (as expected)and Mac and cheese was amaaaaazing. Both dishes make me never want to be a vegan...ever. Like, it's not even a thought.

Been here before, and it still has the charm. For starters, who can say no to an awesome happy hour? $8 cocktails? Sign me up. And these are proper cocktails. Though, I did notice the full price drinks were a bit swankier.

The d√©cor is a bit rustic meets vaudevillian, haunted mansion? That description made no sense. Think Sleep No More, or what-have-you. Old ornate couches and chairs and such. Anyway, regardless, I dig it.

My HH drink was seasonal and gin based, but had the feel of an old fashioned given the vermouth. I dug that. And my second drink was on the fruitier side, but not too sweet. Well done, bartender. My two friends felt the same about their drinks.

It's not the hyper-focused, super-attentive, wildy-creative type of cocktail bar that asks what you like and creates crazy concoctions, but it's certainly a destination worth traveling to and it delivers in every way that truly matters.

4.5 stars. Clover Club is a powerhouse of an establishment, one that I've been hearing about for years now. I live on the UWS in Manhattan so when I first learned of this place, I think part of me assumed/feared that I'd never make it here. A far off place in a faraway land. As it turns out, Clover Club is actually far closer to my apartment than most other places in Brooklyn and I am very pleased with myself for figuring out my error. A college friend of mine used to bartend in the East Village and once raved to me about how this was one of the premiere cocktail bars in Brooklyn. I don't forget statements like this and thank goodness. Everything about Clover Club is fantastic. The ambiance is as good as it gets, the cocktail menu is comprehensive and diverse, and the food is far more sophisticated than your typical bar fare. An easy bet for a date, Clover club is a warm, lively, intimate bar that feels like an elegant study/social club without any of the pretense.

We came to Clover Club at 8:45pm on a Saturday night. Originally, we had planned to get dinner at a more polished restaurant, but I got cold feet last-minute and decided I wanted to find a cocktail bar that just happened to also have a full dinner menu. Enter Clover Club. Just steps from the F train (perfect for a freezing night), has been thriving for a number of years. Classy and inviting, CC features two rooms, each of which has its own appeal. The front has more of a typical ""bar"" feel plus lots of tables for food service, while the back features a fire place and a smaller bar.

Though this is a popular spot, we only had to wait about 10-15 minutes to get a table. It's worth the wait, and you can stand at either bar while you wait. And if you do have to wait, you'll have ample time to look at the drink menu, which requires some real studying.

All drinks here are as good as it gets. Expert crafts(wo)/manship here. Everything is pristinely executed and the range is outstanding. The drink menu is split up to help your decision-making process: Sours/Cobblers, Royales, Gin Fizzes, Hot Drinks, Flips/Nogs, Punches, Stirred/Spirit-Forward and ""The Reserve"". Of the Sours/Cobblers, we tried the Clover Club (Gin, dry vermouth, lemon, raspberry and egg white), What's Up Doc (Dried currant-infused rum, carrot, lemon, orange, ginger, maple, allspice bitters) and the Kentucky Punkin' (Bourbon, spiced pumpkin butter, Palo Cortado sherry, lemon, Angostura bitters). All three are fantastic. The Clover Club is light, fruity, frothy and perfectly balanced. The What's Up Doc is served over crushed ice in a tall class, powerful, flavorful and exciting, fruity and aromatic. The Kentucky Punkin is more decadent but not as heavy as you'd think, yummy and wonderfully seasonal. Of the other categories, we tried the a Gin Fizz, Holland Tunnel (Genever, pineapple, ginger, lemon, Angostura bitters, soda) which I was fawning over. The prevailing flavor was so tasty. Was it the pineapple? I don't know. Yum.

Our nightcaps were more spirit-forward. I love dark drinks at the end of the night, and both were outstanding. We went with the Log Cabin (Hazelnut-infused boubon, apple brandy, maple syrup, Angostura and aromatic bitters) and the Bonfire Old Fashion (Bulleit bourbon 10 year, Michter's Toasted Barrel Finish bourbon, vanilla demerara, Braulio, cherry wood smoke, bruleed marshmellows). Similar style, both rich and warming. The first is nuttier and a little bit sweeter, the second is smoky as you'd expect but not peaty.

As I mentioned, the food menu is nothing to scoff at. Not as exciting as the drinks, but still impressive. Approachable dishes with a decent amount of variety. Eats, below:

Deviled Eggs w/ crispy bacon croutons, paprika and garlic bread crumbs, pickled pepper relish and mushroom duxelles: A-
The least exciting of the bunch but still tasty. Served four ways, I'd say the mushroom variety was my favorite.

Brussels Sprouts w/ romesco sauce, bacon and maple vinaigrette: A
I can't resist a bowl of perfectly crispy Brussels. The table next to us hard ordered these prior to us sitting down, and the decision was already made. Straightforward and wholly satisfying.

Grilled Octopus w/ heirloom beans, curry parsley oil, red cabbage braising jus: A-
The octopus itself was a bit overcooked but not that bad. A nice preparation, though. Seasoned well, good flavors, very warming.

Beet & Dill Cured Salmon w/ chili whipped avocado, cured egg yolk, chives, lemon creme fraiche, ""everything bagel"" spice, brioche toast: A
Beautiful presentation and seriously delicious. I know it looks like there's too much going on here and some might argue that indeed there is, but I still enjoyed this a lot. A creative concept with a great balance of textures and flavors.

Grilled Baby Lamb Chops w/ lemon chimichurri, dried cranberries and hazelnuts: A
Tender and rich with nice seasonal ingredients. This was the bf's favorite. Great presentation and *loved* the nutty accompaniment.

The Clover Club Snub

Gave Clover another go.  My friend and I arrived to a fully seated bar but empty tables.  We asked for a table becuase we intended to have dinner and drinks but the waitress refused to sit us at a table so we resigned to accepting 2 seats in the back with a small side table.  This made it impossible to be comfortable because my friend had a broken arm in a cast.  I tried to explain to the waitress a few times but she was to busy being gorgeous instead of considerate and walked briskly walked away when I tried to gently introduce the subject.  She insisted each time that tables were reserved for a a minimum of 4 people.

We were so annoyed that we finished our martinis and went to Nobu for dinner instead.

Clover fails again.  Too bad, we would have gladly tipped her 30% had she treated us as valuable clients, but I'm not going to spend $600 at an establishment where I'm treated like a second-class citizen.  I will admit the martinis were excellent though, even if the service left a bad aftertaste.

We got the Clover Club Snub once again!

I had the pleasure of meeting expert Mixologist Julie Reiner twice this year; once at a workshop she spoke at in Union Square, and once at a party at House of Yes where she was making cocktails in a secret hidden mini bar.  Both times I found her to be approachable, friendly, and down to earth, and only too glad to share her life experiences in verbal and liquid form.

What she has helped to create and maintain here at Clover Club is beyond reproach, and anyone looking to pilgrimage to NYC for serious cocktailing (like my best friend who was visiting from Baltimore when we came on weds 7/3) needs to make this a spot on their short list.

The charm of this place is unparalleled - from the corrugated tin ceilings to the dark rich leather couches, to the antique and hand crafted bar, and the lack of screens, this is the ideal atmosphere to let the cocktails bring people together.

This was a Tequila and Mezcal day for me so I opted for the delicious Tiger Lily. The perfect balance of smoky mezcal and blanco tequila infused with coriander provided an herbal balance to the tart fruitiness of the lime and fresh mango, the pungency of the ginger, and sweetness of almond orgeat; a true representation of Tiki in its greatest form, served on pebble ice with delicious fruit garnishes.

My good friend stuck to his area of expertise: Gin. He enjoyed the eponymous Clover Club cocktail with its beautiful balance of sweet berries, sour lemon, earthy and savory vermouth, herbal gin, and decadent egg white foam - I actually had to restrain myself from taking too large of a sip.

I am coming back for dinner really soon - this menu has about 14 other cocktails I need to check out, and some delicious looking snacks.

Julie and team, you made a visiting Baltimore bartender very happy, and a New Yorker excited for a return visit post haste.

After getting turned away from a nearby brunch spot with a long wait, stumbled upon this relaxing restaurant on a Saturday afternoon. Trendy lounge decor with a chill vibe due to the large windows upfront. Got a table for two immediately.

To start off we ordered the Toast Plate ($6) to pair with our coffee ($4 each). Plate includes homemade jams and butter along with toasted bread. Bread is a little burnt, but the jams and butter are good enough to mask it. Coffee is your standard fare but comes with free refills. For the main course, shared the Croissant French Toast ($11) and Huevos Rancheros ($12). The french toast is certainly interesting - a flattened croissant filled with fruit and served with maple syrup. The dish is super soft and needed no help from the syrup. Huevos rancheros is a mash of beans, eggs, avocado, and tortilla all swimming in mole sauce. One of the eggs didn't have a runny yolk; otherwise a filling and easy to eat dish.

Service is superb, as water/coffee was refilled constantly, and plates were taken away appropriately. Not seen as a brunch spot but certainly should be.

Really liked the atmosphere here. Super cozy and romantic. Service is really good. Cocktails were amazing. It lost a star because the food was pretty sub par - felt like we were grossly overpaying for bar fare as opposed to entrees. We had the fried oyster app (it was ok, kinda shelly), fettuccine + chicken sliders for main course which were pretty disappointing (and small???). But the dessert (cobbler) was tasty and cocktails are worth returning. But in the future I don't think we'll be ordering big plates again.

I will say the cocktails are good but the service was very poor. I arrived with a friend and and we were at the bar waiting on another friend to come. I put my name down with the hostess and we waited roughly 30 minutes for our table to be ready. By the time our table was ready my friend was still 5 minutes away. I said this to the hostess and instead of seating me an my friend who was there she turned and gave owner table to another party who had just arrived. By the time the last member of our party arrived we had to wait another 10 minutes and ended up at a table designed to fit two people not 3.

Because the table was small and the bar was loud we had to lean in to hear each other. One of my friends caught her hair on fire in the small candle at the table as a result. Luckily she was fine but they did nothing for her at any point. We ended up putting out the candle. As the hostess came around to give us more water she spilled all over me and said that it was a result of not being able to see because there was no candle..... I wouldn't go back if I was paid.

Came at the start of happy hour and was very pleased with the drinks and bites!

For cocktails i had the Georgia Sour and the Northern Lights - both were amazing!

For bar bites we had the Crisps and a Spicy Olives. I would highly recommend the olives.

Quiet, not crazy busy and easy to enjoy a conversation with my party. Excited to come back to try more cocktails and food!

I went Tuesday during the night, it was a very beautifully decorated place and the ambiance was wonderful (I love dim lighting). My friends and I got the booth table in the center where the tiny steps lead to it, which I must say was a bonus to be slightly more elevated than the other tables. For drink I got the eggnog which was very spiked, and the steak and fries. Next time, I'll get the steak medium rare, because the well done tasted a bit burnt, but the sauce complimented the meat well. I also took a bread pudding to go, the top was hard and the bottom was softer. P.S the service was good.

Cute little spot!

Came here on a Saturday night around 10:30pm and was seated at a table promptly (which kinda surprised me to be honest)

The atmosphere is pretty romantic as its dark with dim lights and candles. The place was very busy and I would say that very loud, but thats whats I'm looking for in a bar! The back room is amazing and it has a (working) fire place which made this place super cozy!

I love cocktail bars and this did not disappoint! The cocktail menu was literally a booklet! Huge selection of house crafted cocktails and you can also ask for whatever you want and they'll make it!
I got two cocktails prices at $14 each (which is standard price, but you can get them for way cheaper during happy hour)
I got the blackberry fool which I highly recommend. Its gin, blackberry, vanilla, mint, cream, lemon and rosewater. I fancied a sweet drink and this was delicious! (Its not too sweet)
Then I got the parchment fizz which has gin, lemon, pear, soda and other things I can't remember. It was also a great refreshing cocktail. (I liked the first one better if you can only choose one)
I also tried the hot browned butter rum which was a hot cocktail. Really good. And I tried another gin soda cocktail which I don't remember the name of. Point being- the cocktails are fancy and delicious!

We also tried the beef burger and the chips. The burger came with some creamed cheese, caramelized onions and pickles.  Decent burger but I probably won't get it again. The patty lacked flavor and it was a bit too fatty with the beef, cheese and fried onions. The chips are house-made and fried in duck fat. $16
They have a lot of food and a lot of starters so I definitely want to try other things next time I'm here!

I would also suggest coming here for brunch!

Also super friendly staff and was very helpful.

The Clover Club Snub

Gave Clover Club another go yesterday.  My friend and I arrived to a full bar but empty seating.  We intended to have dinner and drinks but the waitress refused to situs at a larger table we requested because my friend had a broken arm.  I asked nicely a few times and explained our situation but she snubbed us and was super adamant about not giving us a more comfortable table and insisted all of the empty table were reserved for 4 or more people. We were so annoyed that we finished our rounds of martinis and went to Nobu for dinner instead.  Clover fails again.  Too bad, we would've tipped her at least 30% if she had been accommodating but I'm not going to spend $500 on a night out in a place that treats me like a second-class citizen.  The martinis were good though, even though the service left a bad aftertaste.

We got the ""Clover Club Snub.""

Update: The staff reached out to me on Yelp and sent me a sincere apology for the experience.  That meant a lot to me.  It's reassuring to know they're self-aware and focused on improvement... so I'll give it another go at Clover.

I've been frequenting Clover Club for almost a decade now.  You could even say I was a fan.  I've brought dates, coworkers, clients, family, friends visiting from out of town and local ones.  I hesitate to describe the food as ""food"" --""cuisine"" seems more fitting.  The plates never disappoint.

The small bites, such as the steak over toast, is my favorite pair with an Old Fashioned (Char grilled octopus with the Pinot).  I have a friend who is legitimately addicted to the Fried Chicken (It's tasty).  The Lamb Burger with Goat Cheese and the Fizz cocktail with Gin & Lavender take me back to my days as a student in Provence.

Speaking of cocktails, they are expertly crafted by friendly bartenders who take pride in each glass served with precision and speed that defies belief.  I've done some restaurant work and know professionals when I see them.

The only Achilles heel I can see here are the hosts.  Of all the nights I've spent here, I've only had enough negative encounters with a host to count on one hand.  I understand how difficult the customer service aspect of restaurant work is and the pressure that hosts are under so I usually let any rudeness slide.

Yesterday I invited a special someone to Clover for a uniquely special occasion.  She arrived a few seconds before I did (I was halfway down the block and saw her enter).  When I caught up with her at the hosts stand I learned that she wouldn't seat us until we'd both arrived.  I understood this as the restaurant's usual policy but what shouldn't be the usual policy is rudeness.  I don't expect to be treated like royalty as a customer but I can't stand being treated like a second class citizen.  Was this a ""Starbucks Situation""?

How you say something is at least as important as what you say.  This host Melissa snapped, ordered my date to ""Wait at the bar"" in a stern tone, cut her off, and quickly ran away as my date tried to explain to her that I was walking through the door --as I walking through the door.

Unacceptable!

I've spent some great evenings at Clover Club and at their events at Governor's Island (not to mention a few thousand dollars) over the years.  Until yesterday it was worth every penny.

Needless to say, I'm likely to leave those evenings in the past as I suggest the same to all of my friends.

There menu has pretty much Remained the same. They've been able to setup tons of outdoor seating and serve all that food in to go boxes. We ordered (keto friendly) brunch here, and got a bunless burger with bacon, blue cheese, and a fried egg + steak and eggs with a side of salmon.

I think because these meals normally come with a bun, fries, etc, ours happened to look small. The burger (although petit) was really good, loved it with the red onion, blue cheese and bacon. The steak and eggs were good too, and the salmon was cooked perfectly. The portions here should've been a bit bigger for a $25 price tag plus $7 for the salmon.

Happy to support this local biz that's giving their all to serve our community!

My roommate and I made a last minute decision to stop by here for a bite, 10 minutes before their kitchen closed, and we were still seated with a smile. Their drink and cocktail menu is extensive, as well. We ordered two veggie burgers, and let me tell you, they were absolutely delicious. The service is wonderful, too. You truly feel at home here. My cup of water was never left empty, and we were consistently checked on to ensure our needs were being met. I'm so happy this restaurant is open during the COVID-19 pandemic. I will definitely be returning here.

1 star. Gave one extra bc the manager saved the day-ish.
Maybe we were there on an off day?

I think it all came down to poor service and mediocre food. We sat down and it took a while for us to get menus. ok. not a big deal. The waiter took our order but never brought us water. He was filling the water on the other tables multiple times. Was it because we ordered drinks? OK. that's not a big deal either. Then the waiting began. The drinks came about 15 min later. Then, after what felt like forever, ONE of 2 of the appetizers came out. We flagged down the waiter to have him check on the order. He said it was coming out soon. It never came. Then, ONE HOUR later, we flagged down the waiter again, and he said the entrees would be out soon.

Note, we've been at the restaurant for almost 2 hours at this point and only got drinks and 1 appetizer. During our wait, I noticed TWO tables just walk away because they weren't being serviced.

Suddenly, another waiter (probably the manager) noticed something was wrong. He came out and asked us how we were doing and we alerted him about the long wait time. Suddenly, everything was operating like a normal restaurant again. The food came out within the next 10 minutes. We told him one of the appetizers never came so he rushed it out on the house.

Now, on to the food. I didn't try the calamari but the persian spiced wings were decent and the drinks were good. They have some inventive cocktails and the flavors are tasty. But on to the entrees - I had asked the waiter if he recommended the persian kabobs or the salmon and he suggested the kabobs, which were honestly terrible. The meat had an odd crumbly texture and the beef tasted a bit.. old? I also tried the pappardelle which had no flavor and dry chicken. It was also COLD.

we live in the neighborhood and always walk by the place so we were really excited to try it but alas it was a disappointment.

Just left Bijans. And this place was a great find.
Came here mid afternoon on a Saturday. Just a table of two
Started off with some frozen margaritas-- our server pointed out that they were fresh strawberries. Drinks tasted amazingggg and def we're hitting

Also had the lamb burger with feta cheese and sweet potato fries. Boyfriend had the Bijan's burger with feta and fries and we split each burger and shared. Both burgers were amazing. The lamb burger was perfectly seasoned. Like actually the best lamb burger we have had in a while.

Great service. Great food. Great service. Will be back
Upset I didn't snag I picture.

Went recently had outdoor seating on street which was nice and relaxed. Staff was very friendly and allowed us to bring our dog. Main downside was we were underwhelmed with food. Got truffle fries for $8 which didn't come with a dipping sauce just ketchup packets. Roasted eggplant dip was good but thought the pita chips were overcooked slightly. Best thing was probably the chicken kebab and rice, large portion. Spicy shrimp flatbread was unique but also not sure I'd need to come back to try it again. Overall, good service and atmosphere however food wasn't worth price.

While visiting my son in NYC we decided on my last nite in NYC to go for Persian food! I live in Los Angeles and there are 100s Persian restaurant and i was surprised at how hard of a time i had to find them here in NYC! We went to Bijan, I invited my son's girlfriend and her brother as well, by the name of Bijan, and looking through menu I was sure this would be a great way for me to introduce them to my native country food! I ordered kashkeh badenjoon an eggplant appetizer, the one they brought us tasted like eggplants but lacked kashk (cream of whey), i also ordered mast o moosir dish made of yogurt and shallot, ours was yogurt and onions no shallots and tasted horrid! Salad shirazi a salad made of cucumbers, tomatoes, onions in olive oil and lime juice, which tasted somewhat like it tho needed more lime juice and olive oil, for entres i ordered special of the day Gheymeh a dish of meat stew added cinnamon, dried limes and crunchy dried thin french fries! Ours was meat stew w dried limes and actual french fries on top!  I also ordered ground chicken kabob, ground beef kabob and a chicken item from menu which was not a persian dish!  the kabobs ABSOLUTELY did not taste like kabob!! I was so saddened cuz our guests ddnt get to taste wht true persian food tasted!
May I I plz i make a suggestion?! Either rename ur dishes to not be Persian name to do justice to the culinary or simply take all persian items out of ur menu, You are doing unjust to our native culinary!! i gave one star for cocktails and service! Overall the WORST Persian food I hav ever tasted:(

My party of 2 stopped here for dinner after seeing a show at Barclays center (a little less than a mile away) and we got here around 11 PM on a Thursday and we had about 20 minutes before the kitchen closed.

Everything from the dim lit ambiance to the food was amazing! We ordered the calamari (which was crispy and seasoned well) and the beef stew dinner special and the lamb burger. Both were amazing!

We were just happy to find a spot open that late on a weekday for dinner but this place exceeded our expectations! We will definitely be back!

Cash only brunch
Poor service overall
Average food, very basic - served in takeaway plates and plastic so not worth the trip.
Serving brunch (until 4PM) and not lunch as advertised until.
Had an (very) bad experience and will definitely not come back. I'm all for local restaurants but this place doesn't live up to expectations.

Been meaning to visit this neighborhood favorite for a while now and I finally made it for Sunday Brunch.

Fist of- they have a fireplace! So cozy to walk in on a cold rainy Sunday. Their decor is rustic and homey. Very welcoming. The tables seemed to be a decent size- not too big or not too small just right for the space.

The restaurant offers a prefix menu that comes with either coffee or tea, a drink and an entr√©e all for the price of $20 which I think is a great deal for this neighborhood. The prefix menu was pretty extensive and very accommodating to vegetarians (as I am).

I ordered a coffee, drink called Persian kiss and the Persian omelette. The coffee came first, it was pretty decent, nothing to rave about but also nothing to complain about. The Persian kiss was delightful and in my opinion original as I've never had a proseco with pomegranate juice before. The Persian omelette came with a side salad. I had requested an egg white omelette instead of regular eggs and the restaurant was able to accommodate my request. The omelette was delicious. Just the right amount of sweet and salty as a Persian omelette should be. Side salad was fresh and crunchy just like I like it.

Overall a great restaurant and a neighborhood gem.

Bijan is sweet spot super close to our place. Usually they have brunch reservation availability on opentable that's where we booked it from. (This could be a one time experience) but seeing the reviews we were really excited to try this place. A little bit disappointed in the service. Our food was ok but overall our experience wasn't great because of our server. She was really rude to us and despite telling her that the table was shaking and she had a number of empty tables she refused to move us and kept leaving without answering any questions or taking any orders. Probably we will revisit this place to try out again!

Came by Sunday after church and tried the prix fix brunch menu.
I was totally sold.
Your meal comes with coffee and a drink.
Everything was delicious, we had the bojan cocktail and Persian kiss. To eat we had the two eggs plate and the pancakes.

A lovely and warm spot that is about comfort and not spectacle, perfect for a relaxing Sunday brunch experience. In the ever competitive Brooklyn restaurant scene, locally owned and kind places - where the owner is proudly working the floor - might get lost in all the rush of new places with the trendy item du jour and much Insta snapping.

Bijan deserves your support for its gentle Persian twist on brunch, its relaxed and friendly service, and Stephanie, the owner, who graciously welcomes you into her home. We were here for Sunday brunch, where $20 gets you a nice entree, coffee or tea, and one cocktail. We had the Persian omelet, with dates inside for a twist, and a tasty two eggs any style with bacon and potatoes. Whole grain and rye toast were immediately brought to the table: the rye was especially good.

We had a pomegranate with prosecco and awesome hot toddys - with mint added. Last, but not least, was a fantastic home made tiramisu, at Stephanie's recommendation and with our server's hearty endorsement.

In short: Bijan's has good food, fair prices, pleasant service, a relaxing environment, and a proud and lovely local owner. We will definitely be back!

Covid Review: They are definitely short staffed and strugggggling, but you know what's free and easy? Good customer service and communication.  If you can't provide a customer with a menu and or say 'I'll be with you in a moment/asap, I'm swamped'...or hell anything at all, you should consider limiting the number of tables you have available - even though you only have 4, sigh. I waited 8 mins for water to come/ a human - then nothing was said, just thrown on the table haha. I understand restaurants want/need you to work with them during covid times, but that doesn't mean consumers just have to accept just anything. I had the Persian Kiss cocktail...too much pomegranate juice and flat prosecco.  Ugh I wanted to like this place maybe I will try again next year, but for now, nah. Also, the online menu prices are wrong FYI. Hope you have a better experience, the food smelled ok, though I over heard a man stating they messed up his order.

Stopped by on a rainy day for lunch.  Cute place.

Had the lavender vodka cocktail.  Didn't know it was happy hour so that was a nice surprise!  Nice cocktail.

Had the Bijan's burger and it's good.  Fries are yummy.

4 of us reserved a table for dinner at Bijan's on a Saturday evening. We got given a lovely spot by the window. The restaurant is very cute with lots of plants. Service was very good and smooth. I would have loved the menu to be slightly more Persian but I understand it's only a take on their cuisine. Three of us ordered beef stew of the day with rice and a small tomato salad and my husband took chicken kebab with rice. Everyone's food was very tasty. We also had some pita with 4 dips to nibble on. Perhaps they should work on making those a bit more varied.
And their lime/vodka cocktail was one of the best I've ever had. Great little spot for a summer meal. Good for dates also. Will be back.

Delicious food, grossly overpriced. We got the Persian noodle soup ($14) and two side dishes of roasted eggplant and garlic yogurt ($7 each) and were very disappointed in the portion size. The soup was super yummy, but small for $14 and the two sides were RIDICULOUS for $7. It was basically robbery, it was almost disrespectful to give such little food and charge so much.

Cute place, but probably won't be back due to high prices and small portions despite the food being good.

Been here a few times and have never been disappointed. They have excellent cocktails and range of quality food options. The burger was very well prepared and had great flavor. The herb fries are addicting and the wings are delicious.

I ordered the Smoked Eggplant appetizer and Lamb Burger. I've never had anything like the Smoked Eggplant before -- the dip has an almost jelly-like texture with a smoky flavor. It tasted okay but I probably won't order it again. The Lamb Burger was delicious though -- perfectly cooked, juicy, and with a generous serving of thin cut sweet potato fries. The burger itself was smaller than expected, but with the fries the dish really fills you up. Overall, it was a good experience and I'll definitely come again!

I found Bijan's on Yelp long before I even moved to this neighborhood and desperately wanted to love it. Heck, I wanted this to be my new go-to - decor with plenty of character, unique Persian dishes, minutes away from where I knew I would be living..

But truth be told, it wasn't until my third visit to Bijan's that the food appealed to me even in the slightest. The chicken with mashed potatoes and green beans is the dish that gave Bijan's a spark of hope in my mind, but even that entree could use some much needed improvements - the green beans were completely raw and crunchy, as was the garlic sprinkled on them. The chicken leg, although well-spiced and a generous enough portion for two meals, was very dry and made me wish I had a bit more gravy for it and for the potatoes. The sweet chili wings are actually quite good here and I would order them again.

I have also ordered the onion soup, the smoked eggplant mezze, and the bbq pulled pork flatbread here, all of which were extremely underwhelming and left me regretting ordering them. My boyfriend actually had to send the steak and fries back, which is something I never see him do. The crack soup with the chicken broth, rice noodles, and shredded chicken, fresh red onion, bean sprouts would be something I would come back for regularly, but it was impossibly salty, I couldn't eat it and send it back. Such perfect soup ruined by one too many salty chicken bouillon cubes. Ugh, I already know I would be so temped to order it again in hope the chef would take it easy on the salt.. Most food absolutely needs work.

The service is spotty at best. The moody bartenders and servers often seem annoyed while taking orders and then eagerly rush off to chat with their friends at the bar, leaving customers forgotten. The fact that dinner on a Sunday night will easily turn into an over two hour affair (even if you order right as you sit down and don't order drinks) is definitely not ideal either.

The vibe and decor alone deserve 5 stars. I love the black and white Charlie Chaplin movies playing on the big screen, the cozy little fireplace, and the whole strategically unfinished look of this place. However, decor and vibe alone are just half of what I look for in a great restaurant.

Beautiful decor, super friendly staff, and a unique menu. My favourite brunch place in Brooklyn.

1. Restaurant: Warm and colourful decor, a happy place!

2. Food: a unique cuisine! Ever heard of date palms in an omelette? Yes, you'll get that here!

3. Service: they make you feel like home!

Bijan's has been on my friendly neighborhood bookmarks since I moved to the area, so I suggested we try it out when my cousin stopped by for dinner. I think my expectations were a little off the mark from the get-go because I was expecting something very Persian and a more traditional restaurant. I didn't realize that Bijan's started as a bar, hence the giant TV playing football above our heads. It seemed to conflict with the semi-bohemian vibe I had gotten when we walked in, but most of the guests seemed more interested in the food and conversation anyway.

We started off with the Flower Bomb and Lolita cocktails, and both went for the Lamb Burger with sweet potato fries. My Flower Bomb was floral and a bit heady. I actually enjoyed my cousin's Lolita a little more; the cucumber was strong and refreshing.

I'm not sure what I was expecting from the lamb burger, but it was just... a burger. Nothing special about it, just a solid lamb burger on a bun with lettuce and onion. Maybe I was expecting some fun sauces or explosive flavor or something? It was cooked well, but no real wow factor. Next time I would definitely add some kind of cheese (it didn't come with any on!). The sweet fries, on the other hand, were perfectly thin and crispy -- my favorite.

The service was great and it's a sweet atmosphere for a meal, but the food was overall just OK on our visit. I'd definitely stop by again to try the flatbreads or other tasty-looking options and hopefully find something that will wow me!

Very average food.. super salty salad. Steer away from the papardelle as well.
The cocktail was avg at best and even the beer was flat.

Go to any other place by cobble Hill.

If I didn't have lunch and wasn't super hungry.. I doubt I would have had my food here..

How one can oversalt a simple salad is beyond me.

Also it's cash friendly and all prices on menu are based on cash prices.
Service v avg. No one came to even ask how the food was did we need anything else.. nothing. It was a slumberous disappointing meal.

Great food I have no complaints here. Everything my friends and I are were good. Unfortunately their fryer didn't work so we weren't able to taste the sides that originally came with our order. Luckily the substitutes available were a great replacement. Side salads were not dull and looked like something I could just slap together at home. They added vegetables and a unique dressing which I couldn't put my finger on what it was exactly.

My friends and I had a round of Bijan's Burgers just prepared different ways. The only gripe was the extra charge for cheese. I think it was a big steep just to add a slice. I ordered a medium well which was more well than made but was still good. It just not the medium well I asked for, but didn't ruin anything for me.

Drinks were amazing I had a flower bomb and my friends both had different red wines. They both said they loved it.

The server was good and let us know about any changes ASAP. It wasn't his fault. Probably because we can later in the night that a lot of things were sold out, and the fryer needed to be fixed. Lol Outside factors he couldn't control. He was attentive and quick which was all we needed and mattered.

The ambiance was great and cozy. I couldn't stop looking around while conversing with my friends. Actually one of our topics of conversation was how the place looked and the paintings. It was lovely and nice. Plus they played a whole assortment of music which I loved. It fit the scene of the establishment well. Only thing one of my fiends didn't really like was the seating. It would of been great to have more comfortable chairs. I didn't have much of a problem. Glad the chairs had a back piece so I could rest my back on.

We also ended the night with some dessert. My friend and I both shared one tiramisu and one vanilla cheesecake. Even though I was more in a mood for tiramisu; I personally loved the cheesecake more. It has such a rich flavor worth telling y'all about.The desserts as the only thing I took pictures last night. The presentation was so pretty! I couldn't resist. You can also tell by the pictures to how warm and cozy the place was. Well at least I think so.

Still we were all agree, we would and will come back to this place. More to try!

Cute, romantic, and hip little spot. There was a silent movie being showed. Service was fast. I felt relaxed and chilled here. Onion soup was good but my burger was very salty. My husband also said his burger was way too salty. I ordered a frisky whiskey and I felt that I was under poured and over loaded with ice. Martini was good.

Loved everything we've ordered. Make a reservation in advance because this place was getting packed very fast. Cozy atmosphere, delicious food,  and special thanks to a bartender for making us delicious drinks

Very average brunch. My boyfriend and I stopped by here on a Saturday afternoon and the restaurant was empty. I think that should have been a sign because most brunch spots are poppin' from 11am-2pm. Well it was not at Bijan's. The music was also super loud for a 12:30pm brunch. They were playing club music and finally lowered it when a family came in because they had a baby.
The decor was very hippy/save the planet feel. They had communal tables and a lot of plants. I gave 2 stars mostly for the server. She was very kind and attentive.

Now for the food:
- I ordered the breakfast pizza and asked for the eggs to be over easy. I thought everyone knew you don't cook the yolk for over easy eggs! The chef there did not because my eggs were well done and it was not nice on the breakfast pizza. I was hoping there would be some egg porn action and it would be all creamy and delicious with my pizza but no, it was way overcooked and not what I envisioned at all.
-My boyfriend being his basic self ordered the eggs with sausage and it came with potatoes and toast. When the food came the kitchen messed up and gave him really overcooked bacon. I mean we all like crispy bacon, but not like disintegrating bacon...The server was kind enough to just add the sausage on the side. His scramble eggs did not look appetizing either.

Sigh it was such a disappointing meal. I mean at least we didn't have to wait long for food. Maybe dinner is better? However, the brunch really made me not want to go back to try other things.

The most ridiculous customer service I've ever experienced. Walk in without reservation, hostess told me that they don't have table for me. I left and made reservation right that minute through Open Table. They had tables every 15 min on both Open Table AND Yelp.  I showed them that they are available and also my reservation, after seeing it they call me a ""mean person"", ""drama"" and told me that I will not have table tonight even though I had a reservation. I have never felt so offended and discriminated against.

I always enjoy Bijan for Brunch, Lunch or Dinner. I find it a cozy and a warm relaxing place to eat with chill music. So love their Persian Omelet w/ Baby Greens, Bijan Burgers w/ herb fries, Onion Soup, Flatbreads~ Margherita, Veggie & White are delicious too!
The Staff has always been very pleasant and accommodating.
It's just a nice local go to Restaurant in the neighborhood. :)

Cute little spot

Made a reservation here on a Saturday for brunch.

Loved the food and vibe, but they don't accept cards on weekends. (there is an ATM across the street in a deli) but this was an inconvenience since their pages states they do accept credit cards.
We got eggs Benedict and the Persian chicken sandwich. Both were pretty good. I would come back to try other dishes because the food is good!

We each got a couple of cocktails. The one with the cayenne pepper and the pineapple was really good. I would skip the one with the lavender, as it has actual dried lavender in it, which was annoying to drink around.

It wasn't too busy to my surprise, usually its very busy, but if you can - make reservations

They have an actual real fire place, making this place super cozy! (but don't sit next to it because it gets smoky)

Came here for dinner and drinks after seeing some rave reviews on Yelp. The menu looks great and has a great variety on it. We tried the lamb burger which I had with truffle fries. The burger was dry and crumbling and the fries were very oily, was not able to finish either.  Had tiramisu after which was very good.

Service was great and so were the drinks.

This place has a beautiful decor. The food was good. I think that next time I come back I would stick with the burger options. I got the wings and the shrimp with spaghetti squash, but the spaghetti squash only had like 3 shrimp for $16. I think I would have gotten more for my money with the burger and fries. The service was great. I came here on a Thursday night at 1130 and even though the kitchen was closing they accommodate me because I made a reservation on Yelp. It was my fiance's birthday and they gave us a small cake in the house. My fiance had the lamb burger which was delicious, might I add I don't eat lamb, but I tried a bite and it was so good. Will definitely return to try the burger next time I'm in bk late night.

I have lived near this place for years, yet never went until a few months ago. All I can say, is that the atmosphere, food, and service was wonderful. There are many places to go in Cobble Hill, but we will certainly return.

Ever since Bijan's opened up six years ago, happy days are here again. Literally: one time I walked in and Happy Days was playing on the TV.

Fonzie aside, I'm STILL so happy Bijan's is here. It's no longer the new bar on the block, but the seasoned vet that's got regulars, understands our quirks, and gives the neighborhood what it needs. The vibe is intimate, but casual. The music is always good, which makes it the perfect place to kick off your night with a quiet drink, especially since happy hour is very solid.

Best of all, the kitchen is open (and has been, these past 5.5 years), and the food is solid across the board. Brunch is a solid deal (cocktail, food, coffee, juice, all for $17), and the dinner menu has enough variety that everyone can find something to eat. They've got burgers and flatbreads and mezze (they lean a little Middle Eastern), but in my opinion, you can't go wrong with chicken.

The Persian-spiced wings are done right, and the rosemary, lime, sumac chicken is a staple of my diet. Both sound more exotic than they are; the latter is just a perfectly roasted airline breast over haricot verts and truffle mashed potatoes, with a lovely pan sauce to tie it all together. It's a full, balanced, excellent meal for under $20. Enjoy it by the fireplace in winter, and with the doors open in the summer.

It can get a little packed during happy hours or weekend nights in the small space, but the service is always friendly and the drinks are always good. The menu no longer lists the therapeutic benefits of the cocktail ingredients pumpkin, mint, chili pepper, etc., but I still feel good about having five of them in a sitting.

If I was in danger of spending entirely too much time here before they started serving food 5.5 years ago, there's definitely no hope for me now.

Ever since Bijan's opened up, happy days are here again. Literally: one time I walked in and Happy Days was playing on the TV.

Fonzie aside, I'm so happy Bijan's is here. It's about a block away from me, and I can't imagine a better bar to have in the 'hood. The vibe is intimate, but casual. The music is always good, which makes it the perfect place to kick off your night with a quiet drink. As the hour gets later, the soul/funk gives way to more danceable tunes, so it's also a much better late-night spot than my apartment.

And I'm definitely not just saying that because your drunk ass spilled wine on my carpet last time.

It can get a little packed in the small space, but the service is always friendly and the drinks are always good. Larry seems to be behind the bar more often than not, and this is a good thing. He's one of the friendliest, funniest guys around, and spot on with his mixing of the medicinal cocktails on the menu. I love that each drink description tells you the therapeutic benefits of that pumpkin, mint, chili pepper, etc. It makes me feel that much better about having five of them in a sitting.

Good music, good drinks, good vibe...I'm already in danger of spending entirely too much time here. And to top it off, the kitchen is opening in early February...at which point I won't even have to leave to go eat things so I can come back and drink more.

Better get used to it, Larry, you're gonna see way more of me than anyone really wants to.

Such a cozy and cute spot for a weekend brunch. Came here with my fianc√© while wandering around boreum hill, we were intrigued by the $20 brunch special (entree, coffee, and a cocktail). I had the Bijan cocktail which was really delicious and came out beautiful. Got the eggs Benedict which costs $7 extra on top of the $20 special. The Benedict was solid and came with fries and a salad. Surprised to see so many negative reviews about service, our waitress was very attentive and sweet, she checked on us multiple times and was constantly refilling the waters

I was really impressed. The dough is soft and fresh, you can tell it wasn't pre-made. So many options, too. Usually when places have a GF option it's really limited, but here you can get any pizza with GF crust. If you are gluten free, you have to try this pizza. Bonus: you can get nationwide delivery, too!

On my non GF days, I want to try the regular pizza. If the GF is this good, I can't imagine what the standard crust is like. I am absolutely eating here again.

I had my first experience at Keste years ago when I was first moving to the city. I remember the ambience being very cozy and quaint - transporting you a little Italian restaurant. I also remember the pizza being very delicious, so I'm extremely disappointed in myself for not going back all these years. This was where my love for Quattro Formaggi pizza all started.

Anyways, flash forward in time to this quarantine and I've been absolutely craving pizza. Given that everyone seems to be making their own at home, I figured I'd support this Italian gem that I knew was also supporting the local hospitals during this time. I'm so glad I chose it too because it really hit the spot. I kid you not when I say it took me days of staring at all the options on the menu to figure out which kind I wanted. There's so many flavors that it's overwhelming because you truly want them all. I wish I could've done a slice of 4 different kinds! But I ended up going with the GF Ricotta pizza, and boy am I glad that I did. It was so cheesy with the right amount of sauce as well. The crust didn't even strike me as GF - it was so doughy and flavorful! Even the next day when I reheated in the oven, just as good! The pizzas are a pretty good personal size, so I would recommend getting at least 2 if you're sharing with anyone!

I will definitely be ordering again because I'm dying to try one of the pizzas with truffle, and I can't wait until I can dine in again! Thanks for another delicious experience Keste!

So they no longer do the $5 pie. I got the Margherita pie for $13. For the size, it's quite overpriced. It's essentially four half-slices. It's pretty good, but I would in no way say it's the best pizza in NY. It's a standard personal pie on par with others in the neighborhood. Great cheese, very little sauce, thick crust. About a ten-minute wait for the food to come out. A few tables outside.

The waiter told me they are closing this location shortly and leaving the other one open only, FYI.

I haven't tried too many of their pizzas and I don't see myself ever really ordering a variety.

Why, you ask? Two words: the Diavola.

Spicy, cheesy, and oily (in the best way!), this pizza packs a punch. I've been tempted by others but every time I call to place my order it's as if I am possessed by my inner food gremlin. It demands, nay, needs an entire Diavola pizza.

The pizza itself is not large. A person with better self-control might be able to share. That person is not nor will it ever be me. The crust is soft and chewy, which I didn't ever see myself preferring. Yet here we are.

I am being held hostage by a preternatural creature of insatiable appetite and I like it that way.

I went back to New York with my brother to visit the great city of New York City and our birthplace home in Far Rockaway. We wandered in the financial district and sat down to have a fabulous gluten-free pizza for me since I am celiac. Very well made pizza with a great crust that approximated the best of New York Pizza. We then walked around heading up to Murray's which offered the best NY Cheesecake I've ever eaten. We then walked over to a small park at Bleecker and 6th Avenue to eat 1/2 of my cheesecake. Great pizza, great cheesecake, great city. What more can you ask?

Can't believe my last review for this place was over 10 years ago, but this place is an institution!

Churning out incredible Napalese pizza, I've been consistently visiting this place for the past 10 years and figured its time to update my review.

The pizza is still hands down amazing. The perfect chewy Naples style dough, topped with the perfectly flavorful tomato sacue, fresh mozzarella cheese, and a nice touch of basil. Or sausage mushroom, which is always so hard to decide which to get (we end up getting both and sharing most of the time).

What's also amazing is this place offers a truly celiac-friendly gluten free options (baked at the lower level in an separate oven) that has the same chewy, doughyness as the gluten-full version. They even have a fried doughy gf dessert that is amazingly tasty and definitely a guilty pleasure treat.

And with this stay-in-place going on... it's nice to see Keste is still delivering their food and keeping up the morale of New Yorkers. Support a local business, and grab an out-of-this-world amazing pie.

YUM.

For a topping lover, I can't believe I found the sausage(which is delicious) to be too strong for the tasty fresh mozzarella on the pizza, the mild and ""just right"" tomato paste, and the chewy, perfectly baked crust.

The service is friendly, and such a cute little sit-down place for a nice meal too!

I had a mission of finding a good gluten-free pizza place in New York in order to accommodate for Celiac disease. This came up on my searches, and lo and behold it was right next to John's of Bleecker Street which I had wanted to go to anyways. So we came here first before going over to John's.

They said any pizza could be made as gluten-free for $4 more, so prosciutto and arugula pizza was selected. I gave it a try to see how it was. The greatest compliment I could give to the pizza is that...WOW, IT TASTES LIKE NORMAL PIZZA. I'm used to most gluten-free pizzas having crusts that taste like crackers. No, this legitimately tasted like regular pizza. If you had told me this was a gluten-free pizza, I would've said ""you're full of it."" Definitely the real deal.

Service here is great. They know a lot of people come here specifically for the gluten-free pizza and make sure to cook it in separate oven from the regular one. No complaints here.

I'm very impressed by their gluten-free pizza. Definitely wouldn't mind coming back to try some of their regular pizzas!

Had planned on going to John's on Bleecker as I haven't been there since I was a kid. With a line around the block, I looked across the street and saw Keste, a spot I'd heard great things about, but never tried.

Well, if I'm down in the village, I may just have a new go to spot!

First of all, service was super friendly and quick. Our whole meal, and we were on a bit of a clock, probably took all of 30 minutes from sitting down to paying the check. Excellent.

The pear and walnut salad was a great start, very fresh and a nice portion.

The pizza was excellent. Who doesn't love a good coal fired pizza? But, with so many doing it so well, what makes this stand out? Beyond the excellent dough, it's the sauce here that shines. Perfect consistency, with the right amount of heat.

Will definitely be back!

I've been going there for years. Great place great food. I showed up yesterday for lunch, opened the door at 5 mimutes to noon and walked in. Staff was lounging at the bar. Definately not conducting business. They rudely told me/ us ( a party of 4) we are not opened for another five minutes, wait outside. So we left went to an excellent competitor up the block and have no intent or desire to ever return.

We stumbled upon this gem while enjoying the beautiful weather yesterday. Though we were seated right away, as we were enjoying our refreshing drinks, we noticed the patio filled up quickly - a testament to the delicious pizza that were about to enjoy! We split a gluten free margarita pizza- the best gluten free crust we have had in the city topped with perfect ratio of cheese:mozzarella. To end out delightful dinner, we had shared a mouth-watering Nutella dessert. We were thrilled to hear that Kest√© delivers to our apartment in Midtown East! 5 stars for ambiance, food, and service. Bravo!

No shame here: the only reason I stopped into Keste was because their sign seemed too good to be true. A personal pizza for $5. Being NYC, I was expecting a small, hipster pizza that would have me hungry by the time I got home, but I was totally wrong!

The Margherita Pizza I had was not only filling but delicious! There was also the option of getting the white version of this pizza. Unfortunately this was the only option I found to be reasonably priced on the menu- adding additional toppings doubled the price (and while I love pepperoni, my budget doesn't love pepperoni for $5).

Make sure everyone in your party is on time because they only seat entire groups (or maybe just tell THAT friend you're meeting an extra half hour early before the rest of you arrive)

Kest√© is a great place to dine (especially for lunch $9 gluten free pizzas). I ate the whole thing as I had walked for ages that morning and was replacing the calorie deficiency. I thought 'whoa I'm eating the whole thing, I'm really going for it.' Then, the gorgeous girls next to me said well I'm gong to eat my whole pizza so I didn't feel bad. They were young and gorgeous so it must be okay.

Gluten free crust is soft and unlike any other gluten free pizza I've ever had. It doesn't taste like it has a bunch of preservatives or crab loaded in it. It tastes clean and like the real deal. Also it's made in a separate kitchen. The owner must have in depth knowledge of gluten issues.

Joint is nice and cozy and great place to warm up in the cold weather. The lovely girl waiting on me was highly efficient. The pizzas came out in a timely way, all presented well in their round pie glory.

This place has $5 margarita pizzas....what??? That's as much as you'd might pay for a slice in some spots. Unfortunately, it's the other pies that are a lot more expensive.

Overall, I thought the pizzas were solid and I wouldn't mind coming back here. I would always come back for a margarita one.

We had the mushroom and prosciutto pizza, and a meat lovers one called the butcher. These three pies more or less fed 5 people.

The downside for these pizzas was that it was a bit thin, and you could just pick up a slice without assuring it somehow as it was floppy and the ingredients would just collapse. I've def had better ones in the city. Thicker dough would've given it more texture vs just a crust and a soggy middle.

In terms of overall it's maybe 4*, but relative to other spots, I'd have to give it 3*.

Keste Pizza & Vino is not your standard New York pizza. Keste serves real deal Neapolitan pizza with key ingredients imported from Naples. The flour and the tomatoes come from Naples and they are the secret to amazing pizza. The base and crust are perfectly cooked, thin but chewy. We had a pizza and a calzone. Both were terrific. Service was fine and the wine lIst was adequate. Cheaper than a flight to Napoli!

Still one of the best. I've been here numerous times, and they are consistently good. The dough is so great that I actually crave and look forward to the crust, which is pretty wild. I recently tried Pizza Del Re, and it's become my new favorite white pizza. It has truffle cream, prosciutto, mushrooms, and of course plenty of cheese. So flavorful - definitely try this if you like mushroom!

This is definitely one of my favorite pizza places in New York. I can always count on Keste when I'm craving Neapolitan pizza. The dough is always perfectly cooked so that it's fluffy and chewy. I usually share one white pizza (prosciutto arugula) and red pizza (margherita or other). Here's a pro tip: dip the crust in the house-made spicy red chili oil. It's got quite a kick, but it is so so good. Ambience is no-nonsense rustic - nothing to write home about, but certainly feels homey.

It's meh! We ordered the pizza del re (mozzarella, mushrooms, prosciutto, truffle). The dough was way too thin and wet. The middle part of the pizza was very soggy and we had to use forks and knives to eat it. The moisture from the mozzarella was running off the wet dough. The truffles tasted like bland mushrooms with no flavor. I couldn't tell they were truffles.

We saw the other table order the marinara pizza and it looked tastier so we gave it a try. It was better than the pizza de re but the dough was still very thin and soggy in the middle. At least the topping and sauce wasn't sliding off the dough and we didn't need utensils to scoop it up.

We overheard the table next to us. ""I swear last time I was here it tasted so much better!"" said the guy who also ordered the marinara pizza.

I guess the highlight was the tomato basil salad. The cherry tomatoes tasted fresh and mozzarella was light and soft.

There's not much thrill. I don't think we're gonna come back.

Close to NYU. Cozy space. Nice service. With a very nice deal for lunch! Very good crust, simple and good flavor. A friend of mine who works at NYU took me there saying it was one of her favorite spots , and I liked it as well. Salad was not as memorable..but will definitely visit and try more things next time I'm nearby.

Tasty and cheap. The perfect date space. Has a bathroom and it is always clean.

The waitstaff is always awesome and the hot oil - you must use. Do not doubt me. Use it. It's incredible. Don't forget to tip well - they are just so nice!

Stopped in for lunch and it was just as expected! Super intimate feel with tons of options. Their personal sized pizza was the perfect portion. Come here if you are looking for authentic NYC pizza with fresh ingredients.

Went there as the line at John's was long and it was raining and was pleasantly surprised. Most people about neapolitan pies, but this is as authentic as it gets. The pies are like you get in Rome, one pie per person, light and fluffy. The $5 margarita pizza is a steal and must try. Probably the thinnest pizza you have tasted. We tried their Keste special pizza and it was delicious. The crust is not crunchy as the dough is different and probably better on your stomach than perfect 00 flours. Their.speciality pizzas are a bit pricey, but if you order the $5 one along with others, its not that bad.

Eh not my favorite. Out of the three pizza places I visited today... (Lombardi's, Brunetti) this was my least favorite which doesn't mean it wasn't good it just means it wasn't the best. Lol crust was a little doughy, chewy which my daughter preferred but their Margherita pizza lacked pizzazz. Almost bland. The pizza called Regina with the burrata cheese was delicious! Everything was very very fresh. Very small.. place cozy.

My friends and I came to Kest√© around 5pm on a Friday.  When we arrived, the restaurant was about a quarter full, so we were seated immediately.  When we left around 6pm, the restaurant was almost full, so if you can, try to get there early so you do not need to wait!  The interior has a casual, homey vibe.

Kest√© specializes in Neapolitan pizzas, so you won't find the NYC style pizza here.  We ordered a margherita with mushrooms ($16), Macellaio (The Butcher) ($24), and a truffle burrata pizza ($25).  The Butcher included tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, sausage, porchetta, Crespone salami, prosciutto di Parma, basil, and extra virgin olive oil.  The truffle burrata had home-made burrata filled with black and white truffle cream, grape tomatoes, basil, prosciutto di Parma, and extra virgin olive oil.  Each pizza was about 10 inches in diameter.  You could split one if you're not that hungry, but if you come starving, one pizza should satisfy you.  We all enjoyed our pizzas.  It's the perfect balance of crust and toppings.  The pizza also has a juicy quality without being too heavy on the oil.

Service at the restaurant was average.  They did one check-back and filled our waters once.  Although I did thoroughly enjoy my pizza, the steep pricing will only have me coming back once in a while.

Came here with 2 friends, love that they have $5 pies. I ordered the marinara (I just wish there was a little more basil) my friends ordered the margherita & margherita w/ sausage. They provide red pepper flakes and a spicy olive oil - which I'm obsessed with because I LOVE spicy food. For appetizer we ordered the burrata which was also really yummy and creamy.

To be honest, I'm not sure if I would come back for the regular priced pies, as they are mostly $15+. Overall quick& efficient service, would definitely come back!!

Ahhh! Best gluten free and celiac-friendly restaurant ever! A girlfriend of mine is always limited due to having Celiac. She never really gets to enjoy going out for meals due to being worried about getting sick. I do my best to look up places for us to check out and I'm SO glad I read a review about this place. They do, indeed, have a separate kitchen where they prepare theIr gluten free options! The staff are so wonderful. This place is a bit small and does get busy but I've never been somewhere where I felt it was so worth it! I don't even need to eat gluten free but you wouldn't be able to tell! My friend admitted she's never had such great gluten free bread/crust. We will definitely be returning!!!

I'd heard a lot about the Pizza at Keste. We started with a Rustic salad with artichoke prosciutto and a light lemon vinaigrette dressing. Greens were fresh and the bread was even different. A good different. Very rustic and healthy flavor. Then came the pizza. And here is where you have to know authentic Italian pizza and this is authentic. Thin crust with just the right amount of crispness. An outer crust that wasn't too thick and perfect to eat every bite.  We had the Georgia pizza with fresh mozzarella, lemon marinated bresaola, arugula, shaved parmigiano reggiano and extra virgin olive oil. A wonderful combination. Great service. The restaurant is kind of cramped and small but where isn't it in New York City. I would suggest eating there though because there is nothing better than fresh out of the oven.

Amazing Lunch Special!! If your in the area looking for a great cheap lunch here is where you should head. The have 11' basic personal pizzas for $5, $5 salads and special 8' pies for around $10-$12.

I choose one of the speciality pies; it had pistachio pesto, sausage and mozzarella for $11. Honestly is was amazing! I was a little wary about how good it would be because of how many stickers this place has on the door talking about how it's the best this place deserves all of those. One of the best pizza's I had in a very long time. The table held a bottle of spicy oil which took this already great pizza to even higher heights.

As much as I wanted to get a glass of wine, $11 for a Pinot during lunch is too steep for me. There are so many good places with cheaper drinks it wasn't worth getting a glass of wine the same price as my pizza.

I took a star off for how in my face the servers were. Please just let me eat without you hovering over me with the need to fill my glass of water every time I take a sip. Breathing room is my friend please respect it.

We came here based on a recommendation and our experience wasn't bad but we were a bit disappointed. The food itself was good, however the vibe was very strange. Three men (not sure if owners or servers) stared at us and spoke quietly while watching us during the entire. freaking. meal. I don't expect to encounter the sweetest people when in NYC but I guess we expected not to be stared down while trying to eat pizza.

Good thing New York doesn't have a shortage on pizza because we probably won't be back.

The pizza here is really unique snd it is fun to atleast try it once. We tried the margherita pizza (5$). The portion of the pizza was big and it was good. If you add toppings to the pizza then it is expensive. The server was really friendly and great service. This place is much better than the prince pizza couple of blocks away.

Kest√© was recommended by a friend of mine. It's not ""New York"" pizza. It's Neapolitan pizza, so this is not the place for you if you're looking for New York pizza - because I made that mistake BUT Keste is surprisingly very delicious. Based upon the host's recommendation, I ordered the most popular, signature pizza: keste! Go figure! It's tomato sauce, imported buffalo mozzarella, prosciutto di Parma, arugula, gran cru pecorino, basil, made with extra virgin olive oil. What's great about Keste is that they offer a nice section of gluten free options.

This location is very small, so be prepared to wait for a table. We were informed that the Fulton location is much larger and can accommodate large parties. The service was on point. Everyone was friendly and professional. Prices are a bit high... my pizza was $21. And yes, I easily finished it myself. If you're in the neighborhood, definitely check out Keste. I noticed a Michelin Award in the window :)

In the midst of all the best pizza places in New York, there's Keste... Don't let this first sentence fool you... Keste is within one of the best pizza places in New York hands down, but not your average New York pizza though (or dough). Keste is true Italian pies with true fresh toppings.

You will not find your classic pepperoni or Hawaiin pizza here. Only the best of the best and some of the most exotic combination are available.

My friend told me to expect a wait but on a Wednesday night in the village, we were just walking in and been seated at a table in front of where all the magic happens.

I went for the pistachio and salsichi pizza and my friend for the Burrata truffle pizza. I'm a big truffle fan so we needed to share. We agreed on 50-50 but soon after I tried mine, that deal was down the drain. Although his was very flavorful, mine was an explosion that I have never received on a pizza.
In the beginning I was a tad dissappointed to see that the crust wasn't very cripsy but the tast was just perfect.

Service and atmosphere are amazing too.

The Kest√© experience and pizza cannot be beat! Their ingredients could not be more fresh - the tomatoes, meats, motz, basil it all is supreme.
Their Margherita pizza melts in your mouth, and the sauce is to die for.  What makes Kest√© so special and such a joy to visit though,  is the service and kindness.  Vito is wonderful, and wants you to enjoy! He makes you feel incredibly welcome, and treats you like family.
It is this service, and delicious food, that keeps New Yorkers and neighborhood locals coming back time and time again.
PS try the NUTELLA dessert pizza - it will also rock your world!

The pizza was delicious! We had the gluten-free pistachio & sausage pizza and the gluten-filled margarita pizza; both were delicious. Service was prompt, and the prices were very reasonable at lunch time. This may be the best pizza we've ever had.

I cannot say enough good things about Kest√©. Not only is their food amazing, but their staff is professional and kind. I recently had an issue with a Kest√© order through Seamless (it was a Seamless issue and not an issue with Kest√©), but Kest√© called me to see what had went wrong and offered to make the issue right, which I had no expected at all and was very impressed by. Their gluten free pizza is especially amazing. I have a gluten allergy and looked for just-as-good-as-normal pizza for years. Nothing beats Kest√©'s gluten free pizza. My boyfriend, who was born and raised in Italy, said it was the best pizza he's ever had (talking about the gluten free version). If you're in NYC, you must check out Kest√©!

I love their $5 Margherita pies :) One of New York's best value deals for Neopolitan pizza. Service is fast. The sauce is excellent as well . This is my favorite insider lunch in Greenwich Village if someone is coming from out of town and wants a cool real Italian pizza experience.

An ideal day: Dellarocco's pizza, an aperol spritz, and outdoor dining.

The pizza is so good but the crust is next level, as everyone else has mentioned on here. Fluffy, airy, and slightly charred from the oven. The pizzas aren't huge but you could definitely split one with another person. Or, just go for it and make it your own personal pizza. They have gluten free and vegan options as well.

They've for sure followed all of the social distancing rules which I appreciated, so no one was seated right next to other tables. Will definitely be coming back here or ordering takeout! I have my eye on the pizza with truffle oil and the red sauce with pancetta and leeks.

We've come here before covid and loved the pizza and service, and now it is our takeout choice for good artisinal pizza. I usually don't care for pizza crust, but I absolutely love Dellarocco's. It's not always a given with delivery, but our pizza arrived warm and ready to eat (not cold and sad).
We ordered 2 pizzas -
Quattro Gusti - includes 4 different types of pizzas - Margherita STG, Arrabbiata, Zucchini, and Dellarocco. The Arrabbiata (tomato, mozzarella, hot soppressato, spicy EVO) was by far our favorite and we'll probably order an entire pie next time.
Monalizza (white pizza) - N'duja calabrese, ricotta, sweet orange tomatoes, mozzarella, Mike's hot honey - also our favorite. the tomatoes were a juicy compliment to the ricotta and hot honey (not too spicy)
Definitely recommend and we will definitely be ordering again, but can't wait to be able to come back for in-person dining!

I can't believe I'd never even heard of this place until the time of covid. My hubby and I decided to check this place out because it's on a quiet street and they have outdoor seating. The atmosphere and service were great ... not to mention - really good pizza !! I don't think I have one negative thing to say about my experience here - we'll be back : )

Their pizza: 4.5/5
Speed: 0/5

We went on a Saturday around 2pm and sat outside, there was maybe 1 or 2 other patrons in the restaurant at the time. We waited for approx 20min for our 1 pizza!

The pizza itself was delicious, crunchy and pillowy crust which is how I judge my pizzas. But I would never go back and go for a sit down experience again. May have to try takeout but I would expect a wait as well

Absolutely stellar pizza, with a crust you'll dream about after eating. They are small affairs; personal pies, really, but astounding in quality and absolutely worth the price. The quality of the ingredients is evident in every bite, and amplified by an attitude of craftsmanship that turns a piece of flat bread into a work of art.

If you don't know where to start, try the namesake Dellarocco. The traditional interplay of broccoli rabe, sausage, and peppers showcase everything great food should be: a callout to tradition with a steadfast resolve to keep things fresh and accessible.

The narrative here is quality, not quantity, and the recitations hew closely to that story.

We had a great time there. The arugula salad was great and the pizzas were absolutely heavenly, especially the Brigante! Service was great too.

So yummy! We ordered two pizzas for delivery and it came on time and was still pretty warm. We had the Brigante and Arrabbiata, which were both delicious. I believe they have heaters right now for outdoor seating, too.

Very good wood fired pizza. Pizza is of the thin, soggy type but delicious. Had the Buratina and my son had the margarita.

Good drinks, good pizza. Service has a little to be desired right now but I'm trying not to hold that against places too hard during Covid. Wait wasn't terrible considering it was a Friday night and very busy. Can't wait to come back and try other pizzas!

Dellarocco's has the best pizza around.  The crust is crisp and slightly charred, the tomato sauce is delicious, and whatever topping you choose only adds to the pie's deliciousness.

My husband discovered this place from following the Vegan New Yorker in Instagram.
They use a new vegan cheese the mimics fresh mozzarella called NUMU.
Listen when I tell you this place has got a good vegan pie.
As soon as you enter you're overwhelmed with delicious smells of garlic and fresh baked dough.
We also loved the marinara sauce which is very fresh and bright.
They can customize any pizza on the menu to make vegan and they also had a few vegan options listed.
The dining space is open and comfortable, not crowded or stuffy.
The service was very good as well.
The kids liked that you could see the brick oven with the ""kitchen"" open to the dinning room.
Very Highly Recommended.

Dellarocco's Brick Oven Pizza is an outstanding neighborhood pizza joint.  The food is reasonably priced, the service is solid, and the pizza is delicious!

This pizza place let's the quality of it's ingredients speak for themselves.  While the pie's are light on cheese, they're incredibly flavorful.  The crust has the perfect amount of crunch, the dough is light and airy, and there's a wide variety of topping to choose from!

Strongly recommend.  P.S. make sure to grab an ice-cold Peroni on tap!

Dellarocco's is a great neighborhood place for pizza. I've dined in and ordered takeout, and would recommend the former. The storefront is located on Hicks Street, off the hustle and bustle from Montague. The space is quite lovely, with large windows and bright white walls.

The wood-fired Neopolitan-style pizzas at Dellarocco's have a light and airy crust, though the thinness often means the center of the pizza gets a little wilted (which is why I recommend dining in over takeout). To combat this problem, I would suggest keeping to the white pizzas as the addition of tomato sauce adds to the heaviness/sogginess of the delicate crust. Some pies I would recommend include the Dellarocco ($18) with smoked mozzarella, broccoli rabe, Italian sausage and garlic or the Tartufata ($21) with truffle cream, shiitake mushrooms, mozzarella, and speck.

Sooooo I came here on a Thursday night with a good friend of mine and this place was packed! It was my first time visiting but definitely not my last. I loved the decor a bit of a rustic feel on the inside. There's a bar area with stools you can sit and grab a glass of wine and chill.

There's also two main rooms where they sit people with one of the rooms a bit tucked away to the side seemed more intimate to me.

My friend and I started off with an appetizer with different cheeses, grapes and slices of bread with jam. The sweet and salt taste was so amazing and the different type of cheese was a good starter.

For our pizza we had the Quattro Gusti (four selections) so we both had the opportunity to sample four different styles of pizza! Definitely didn't disappoint with their oven style!

The atmosphere is very relaxed even though they were packed and they had customers waiting we didn't feel rushed to leave.

So I landed at JFK and the first thing on my mind was PIZZA! New Yorkers love their pizza and so do J but there is one huge problem, I'm allergic to gluten. So pizza for me typically tastes like someone melted cheese on the cardboard box the pizza comes in...well not at Dellarocco's!

Their gluten-free pizza was so soft, tender, and airy...what a treat. I ordered the meatball pie and I ate it all...it was phenomenal. The only downside I would say is that it wasn't too flavorful but other than that it was cooked to perfection.

I definitely will eat there again.

Heard a lot about the place.
Ordered a pizza with extra toppings - out of 5 toppings ordered 2 were not present at all, literally - not a single piece. Half of the pizza missing cheese altogether. The crust on another side half-baked, like chewing gum. Utter disappointment, absolutely worst NYC pizza I ever had.

Photo of Dellarocco's - Brooklyn, NY, United States

Dellaroco's is conveniently located in Brooklyn Heights with many train and bus lines nearby. The place looks beautiful, it is spacious and even has a bar area. I like that they offer 3 vegan options for pies along with their vast dairy options. I ordered one of the vegan pies, can't remember the name, but it was the one with brussels sprouts. The pie used Numu cheese which is usually very good at other places, here it seems the cheese did not melt well. I also found that pie was still doughy and had not firmed up in the oven. My friend who ordered a regular also did not enjoy her pie.

Wow wow wow I'm so impressed. My SO and I came here for a Monday night date night - we typically never pick Italian because of the lack of vegan options. We decided to look at the menu any way because it is a long time neighborhood favorite and we love pizza. While I was just expecting a red pie with veggie toppings, Dellaroccos recently added a small vegan menu that has VEGAN CHEESE and carefully selected toppings. It would be an understatement to say I was excited

We ordered the grilled veggie appetizer that was so much more than slices of veggies, they made a beautiful presentation of eggplant, peppers, and zucchini. The flavor was unbelievable !

I had the Lei pizza which was a burst of flavor in every bite. I was beyond impressed with the flavor - it wasn't just an every day ""oh here are your toppings on dough"" they were tastefully pulled together. Definitely returning!

Absolutely horrible. See pictures.  Here we are trying to support local businesses by ordering food and after spending over 40 dollars for a personal pizza and a kale salad, this is what they send over? Paid for EXTRA meatballs...do you see ANY , let alone extra. Looks like it was swallowed and regurgitated by an alligator. Disgusting.  Dry and dead kale leaves is what they are presenting as  a kale Caesar salad.  Spend my 40 dollars well. The food is in the  trash.  THANK YOU!  Wish you continued success

Dellarocco's has the best pizza!!! We came here often before Covid and the service was always good. My bf loves this place but we were all stuck inside during quarantine so for his birthday I surprised him with a Dellarocco's pizza delivered to his apartment. Angie was super helpful in making sure the pizza box was decorated with the words Happy Birthday! It was decorated really pretty and my bf loved it!! See the photo. You can tell they cared and wanted to make it nice. I definitely recommend!

Such a great find in Brooklyn! There is tons of good pizza spots in bk but this one should be listed in tops pizza spots. It's delicious thin crusted pizza that makes you want more with every bite.
My brother and I took my cousin visiting from England (in the picture, lol) and they both went back again the next day.
The staff is also very friendly.

Wood Fired Brick Oven Pizza Restaurant in Brooklyn is such a great nook. I loved the Eggplant it was very tasty. After going to Italy 2 times a year for 7 years I'm picky about the way the sauce taste. Call me crazy but once you have pasta or any Italian food in Italy .these Italian restaurants in NY have a picky one on their hands... LOL. But this place gets it very close....
With my Eggplant plant dish I had a glass of Montepulciano which was at the right temperature to taste..

Montepulciano, one of Italy's most popular red wine grapes, has thrived in Abruzzo- region of east-central Italy, since the middle of the 18th century. A plump grape, which gives good yields of easy-drinking wine, it is popular with producers and consumers alike. The variety typically provides deeply colored juice ,which varies from ruby to purple depending on vintage and the particular winemaking techniques used, with low acidity and soft, unobtrusive tannins.

YUMMMMY!!!

I don't know what's going on here with this crust, maybe I am just not sophisticated enough to understand this pizza. I was on my way to Carroll Gardens when it started to rain, so I decided to look for ""best Bklyn pizza nearby"". This came up, and the pies looked promising, but...Listen I know everything is not L&B, most of the pies in NYC are thin Neapolitan, but I just don't expect to fold my slice and pick it up and it flops down like I'm trying to hold melted cheese in my hand. I guess that's the reason for the knife and fork, but the paper thin slice didn't even seem done all the way through. I am not eating a crepe, I expect a little architecture to the crust, something to give it a base. Am I wrong here?

And if we're being all sophisto and white napkin in this place, then shouldn't you be able to explain the food to me a little bit? Isn't that the characteristic of new foodie Bklyn restaurants, that they tell you every little thing about the food you're eating, both on the menu and in person? The sausage was so good, but the staff had no clue. You know, what kind, where's it from, is it local, made in house, is there someplace I can buy it, what! Pepperoni, same. Cannoli, same. Is it from a bakery around here, hello? They just seemed to be phoning it in, waiter-wise. And btw, the cannoli? Meh, too much sweet ratio, if I wanted to eat an entire bag of powdered sugar I would do so.

I would say that I really don't care about waitstaff, the focus is the food, and the crust is not up to the standard of classic pizza in my humble view. I think maybe it was cooked wrong, the outer crust was perfect, chewy, little burnt spots, smoky taste, the cheese great and fresh, the porcini mushrooms, so good, the other slices of kale and sausage, how creative and a great mix, but...crust, the rebar of the pie, if you will, the inner part has got to be firm enough to at least carry a basil leaf without collapsing. But what do I know. Anyway, yeah, Carroll Gardens next time.

The photos of pizza were amazing... but I guess you can't eat the cover of a book.

We ordered delivery last night and ordered a specialty pizza with toppings and a meatball app. The meatballs and sauce tasted great. A little too bready though.

Our $30 pizza was disappointing:(

Dough was chewy and without substance. The pizza couldn't take the little toppings and cheese it came with
- ordered extra toppings.  Maybe they added them, I couldn't tell.
I am sure the ingredients are primo, are they worth $5 each for a small personal 12 inch? NOPE

$45 total

We pass this place many times and think its a cute, family oriented restaurant. Overpriced, overrated and I am over them.

Pros:
Great pizza flavor
Super moist meatballs
Nice atmosphere
Clean

Cons:
No official bartender led to a bad cocktail and improperly poured wine spritzer
Crust wasn't crispy so droopy pizza
One server meant needing to call him over for drinks more water and then the check
Also not the biggest thing but bread to start is nice in an Italian restaurant.

This is totally expected since it is FiDi in the middle of the week. Sometimes we would come on a Saturday night and it would still be fairly busy.

Last week was my first time back during Covid, and I tell you what, Adrienne's did not miss a beat. The Pizza had the same incredible flavor, the tomato sauce still had the same power punch to it, the sausage was just as flavorful as ever. Going on a Sunday during a pandemic, we expected to see the restaurant a little empty but for a Sunday afternoon it was bustling. So we were definitely happy to see that.

My recommendation is one baking sheet pizza for every two people. There are days I can eat a pizza myself, but sharing it way better that way you can have a taste of a few others. Sausage and Ricotta is my go to!

Our favorite pizza in the Fidi area and delivery always went well when we were feeling too lazy to go out for it. The dough is amazing and we were big fans of the Romana, such good prosciutto. And when you do go in person, Stone St is a beautiful atmosphere to eat outside on and pizza always tastes better accompanied with a Peroni beer tower!

Hands down the best pizza in lower Manhattan! Their restaurant is cozy and wait staff is always nice. Pizza has a perfect amount of sauce and crunch. The toppings are always fresh! I've also ordered delivery from here several times and they always come on time and pizza tastes delicious!

I've worked in the FiDi area on and off for about 14 years. While I was always familiar with Adrienne's, I never ate here or even tasted their pizza. Whenever we ordered pizza, it was from Harry's, which is very similar. As I was attending a comedy show in Battery Park, I decided to venture here for an old fashioned.

I called ahead and the staff was very friendly. They told me 15 minutes, but I got there in 10. I believe they may have just given me a pie that was ready since the person hadn't arrived--no problem with me.

The pizza was good, as I said, it's very similar to Harry's. Although I believe Harry's May be slightly more flavorful. If you don't mind spending $30 for a pie, this is your place that's locTed in the heart of the famous, Stone Street, in the Financial District.

The pizza was pretty good. 5 adults shared one old fashioned style pizza that comes square, as opposed to their standard 12+ inch personal pizza, which are probably good for one person, if you're hungry.

They didn't have any soup left on this Sunday afternoon, the place is a bit difficult to find, and the bathrooms in the basement need a good scrubbing and the door fixed.  The seating on high stools isn't the most comfortable as some seats have backs and others are just stools.

The staff was very friendly, prompt and courteous.  The pizza is definitely very good, but overall the experience is really just average.

Let me tell you, Adrienne's Pizzabar was awesome. Delightful menu items at great prices, amazing mood to unwind at. The menu is really outstanding, so many very good choices, I had to go with Lasagna, and it was wonderful. I became very good friends with the staff, who are all great and super helpful. Seriously! If you ever be around that area make sure you come try Adrienne's Pizzabar.

This place is located on Stone street, a very lively area with lots of bars and restaurants, all of them offering plenty of outdoor seating.
Inside Adrienne's the atmosphere is modern and sleek with wood accents and a long bar. We went late on a Friday, well after 9pm and were lucky to get a table for two,it's a popular spot.
The pizza is rectangular, thin crust and delicious with a crisp and puffy dough, and high quality ingredients.
My only disappointment was the Tiramisu, made with only one layer of mascarpone on the top, it did not have the richness we are usually used to.
Still, I totally would go back and recommend Adrienne's Pizzabar!

I'm not sure why this place gets the stars that it does. I have been here several times and each time I am disappointed. They are so busy all the time and the pizzas get mixed up and show up cold and dough soggy.  Too many better places to go in the city.  Won't return.

We think we got delivered a pre made pizza, well the crust with the cheese already cooked hours earlier and the procuitto and mozzarella put on when our order came in.  Our pizza was cold and it was delivered 20 mins after we placed the order.  So disappointing

Sooo good, had a old fashioned with arugula on it and a Caesar salad both large enough to share.  Caesar salad was loaded with Parmesan & crusty crotons.  The pizza came out hot, delicious & FAST.  This place gets very crowded But service was spot on.

The service was great and our waiter was very kind to us. We wanted to order some pasta, but they said they didn't have it, so I gave them 4 stars. So, we ended up ordering some Square pizzas. This place is good for a little lunch or breakfast. The beer tasted nice under the tent

What a great spot on a little street. Pizza old fashion was awesome. It's got such a great vibe.
Beer was brilliant and staff very nice.
It's loud and shared tables but what a nice time.
Definitely a-place I will go back to when down town with friends and family. I recommend it.

My friend and I got the old fashioned pizza with mushroom, garlic, and sausage as extra toppings. Each topping costs $2-$4 so the total came out to be around $34. It was a bit pricey for a pizza but I didn't realize how big it was until the waiter came out with it. The pizza was enough for two of us and we even took some of it to go.

I strongly recommend choosing garlic for topping because it made the pizza even more flavorful.

The restaurant also has a great ambiance, perfect for any occasions!

Walked in for lunch on a Friday afternoon, they have two entrances, one were the outdoor seating is and one in the back. I walked in the one in the back, no waiters even bothered with me...it made me feel like I wasn't supposed to even be in their restaurant

Ordered an old fashion with mushrooms, garlic and pepperoni. Comes in 10 slices. Honestly wasn't anything special at all, the sauce was just tomato sauce, crust was soggy. The total for the pie came out to be $45 and it was 100% not worth my money.

I had a work meeting down in FiDi and we grabbed lunch from Adrienne's. Normally I'm selective when it comes to pizza spots, but since I was with a bunch of my colleagues and wanted something fast and easy we decided to try it out.

We picked up a couple of their square pies as well as some Caesar salad. I tried their sausage-pepperoni. The crust was nice - not a traditional New York thin slice but also not thick like a Sicilian. If I had to measure thickness it's somewhere between regular crust thickness and the squares you get at Prince Street Pizza. Anyway, the slice was pretty good - nice abundance of toppings with a decent sauce. It didn't wow me but it also wasn't offensive. The salad was fine - nothing too out there, very basic greens/cheese/croutons/dressing.

Overall, I enjoyed my pizza at Adrienne's. Three stars from me for a solid offering but not blowing me away. That being said, if I was in the area again  I wouldn't be against returning.

This place has been on my ""To Try"" list for a while now, and we finally got to it tonight. So glad we did! It's a bustling little place with very attentive staff. We were seated immediately, even though I wasn't sure there were seats...but waitstaff just whisked a table clean and we were ushered into it seamlessly.

We already knew we wanted an Old Fashioned Red, no extras. My husband got a Brooklyn Lager, which he enjoyed in a tall, skinny glass. I had a cranberry juice because, hey, I'm evidently 90 years old.

In short order, our fresh pie was steaming in front of us, and we couldn't wait to dig in. The best word for our experience was ""fresh"" -- the red sauce tasted like fresh tomatoes just out of the garden. The cheese tasted freshly made, and so did the dough. It was simple yet striking, and we devoured that pie like the animals we are. Yeah, baby, that's how you do it!

Again, attentive staff. Clean space. Fresh food. We will be back!

The pizzas here are good but definitely not among the best I've tried in the city. They're known for their Old Fashioned Pizza, which is a rectangular pie (you pick either red or white sauce) topped with your choice of toppings. The base price for the pie is $27, which may seem high but it's designed to be shared among 3 to 4 people. I made the mistake of ordering a non-pizza item here once and will never do so again. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, STAY AWAY FROM THE PASTAS. Cocktails here are cheap (for NY standards) but not good.

But the thing I dislike most about this place is the service, which is abominable. If you're lucky, they'll just take your order with a blase and expressionless face (a la Kristen Stewart in Twilight). If you're unlucky, they'll even give you attitude, like it's so awful that we're imposing on them for their service.

If you want pizza and happen to be the area and are lazy, by all means, come here. But know that better pizzerias with better service are just a few subway stops away.

I had originally planned to meet up with a friend to eat outside, enjoy the nice weather and catch up... but when we arrived at around 5:30pm today, sitting indoors was the better bet. Was selfishly disappointed at how crowded and loud the outdoor area was... but the whole city was probably just out celebrating the beginning of MDW, can't blame them.

We got the margherita pizza to share and it was just ok. A little too salty (and watery?) at first bite but it progressively got better. The complimentary bread was very doughy and better than most but the carbs on carbs was a little too much. I also ordered the Hennylicious (cocktail) which was very good.

In terms of service, waiters and busboys were a little TOO attentive and I felt like we were constantly being rushed by them. They took away our oil/vinaigrette for the bread before we were even done, cleaned up the napkin I was still using, and asked us multiple times if we were done with our food when we were clearly still working on it. There were a couple of other tables available and no wait outside... not sure what the hurry was.

Still, I'd return to try out one of their famous square pies, and maybe during an off hour when it's not too crazy out front.

It's not a trip to NYC without making the trip down to Stone Street and having a pie at Adrienne's Pizzabar. Every time we bring someone new, it's their new favorite pizza.
We have never ventured away from the pizza, even though the other menu items look great. I couldn't imagine coming here and not getting pizza.

This is a pretty good pizza joint in the Financial District. Came here with some friends from out of town and we were all equally happy with our meal.

The pizza here is quite good, with a crust that's a bit thicker than a traditional New York slice. Toppings were quite generous and tasty. We got the rectangular old-fashioned pie with red sauce and half-and-half toppings. It came out hot and fresh and was delicious! The bruschetta appetizer we got was quite good as well. For drinks we went with wines by the glass and were quite happy with what we got.

Ambiance wise the place is quite similar to other restaurants in this part of town - it has an air of 'old school New York', with its high ceilings and warm decor. Service was quick, no-nonsense  and to the point. They did hesitate to give us a second round of bread though, claiming they had 'run out' but somehow discovered more bread and got it out after we ordered dessert.

Tasty pies in a historic and highly visited part of town. They need to work on their service, but the food here is well worth dropping in for.

Great spot on stone street. Must get there early! The lunch rush is insane. I got there at 1150 and made great timing!

Drinks are very strong. Recommend you getting a mixed one.

Pricing is a little more for the area but it's great pizza, which you can split!!

Damn good pie! Everytime I come to New York I have to have my pastrami, pizza and hot dog not all at once lol. So this was on my list of places to visit. After putting in my steps I decided to top off the night with a nice pizza. It's a straight up bar/restaurant. I was solo so I just sat at the bar which was full service. The staff here was great typical NYC folks. That's not a bad thing I love NYC . So I got served fast a nice cold beer and a hot pizza. The pizza was one of the best I have had. The crust was flavorful and the sauce was just right. This joint is a must for pie heads.

I've decided to visit Adrienne Pizzabar as a recommendation from a co-worker after work who raved about it. Usually, we opt for Mexican cuisine, but decided to switch it up.

Firstly, I do like the atmosphere and look of the Pizzabar. Nice seating and bar set up. However, what I did not like was the rush service. Give people the opportunity to know what they want! I enjoyed my half glass of Merlot my co-worker his beer and wine.

Be aware, there are no individual slices to order. You get a traditional square 10 slices total with a choice of toppings. We opted for extra sauce (which was not extra sauce) with arugula and chicken. The slice portions are decent, definitely meant for two people. However, I was not blown away! When your hungry and for their prices you'll make sure not to waste anything.

I've had better pizza elsewhere, but don't regret trying someplace new. I sincerely hope they look into training their wait staff to be a bit more patient and stop asking are you ready to order! Even while talking, they are ready to clean up and prepare for the next guest.

Overall, I won't be returning but I gave them three stars for the decor and drinks!

Looks appealing, but Pepperoni pizza was OK. The flavors are very strong. It is heavy on the palate. The crust was thick, but crisp and later on had hints of denseness. The pizza was very oily. The Parmesan pizza packet that was provided is expired on 7/12/2019, but today is 8/26/2019.

Met up with 3 coworkers here for lunch and it was pretty darn good pizza. Between the 4 of us, we split an Old Fashion Pizza with pepperoni and half mushrooms and a Caesar salad. The salad was lovely - perfectly dressed and super fresh. The pizza was really good. Thin crust and super saucy. I really liked that it tasted different than many other pizza spots in the city.

Between the 4 of us, each of us had 2 pieces and 2 of us had an extra piece. It's definitely a lot of food and very shareable.

Service was friendly and attentive. Our food came out in a very timely manner. If it's nice out, I highly recommend sitting outside.

Best pizza and probably most popular pizza place in the FiDi. Period.

For the longest time that I can remember, Adrienne's has always been the go to spot for pizza pies in the FiDi for just about everyone who works in the southern part of the area. Whenever the company departments that I've worked for are in need of pizza pies for a lunch meeting or pizza party, Adrienne's was always the 1st option ... and for good reason.

Yes, they don't sell individual slices and the pies are pretty pricey at $27+ (not including $2-$6 toppings), but they are worth every penny. Adrienne's serves 2 types of rectangular pies, red or white, with super thin crusts and customers can add a multitude of toppings, but they do come at a hefty additional price as well. In the last few years, I've had a chance to try many red pies, with various toppings, including pepperoni, mushrooms, roasted peppers, sausage, etc.

The pizzas they serve are extremely flavorful and delicious. There is a bit of oil on the top of their pies, but to be honest, it makes the pies SO GOOD. And when you throw your favorite topping on it, mine being their pepperoni cups, it's that much better.

To be truthful, they might be one of my 5 favorite pies in all of NYC. The restaurant typically is crowded during weekday lunch times and post-work, since it's located right by Stone Street, so try to show up a bit earlier to beat the crowds. It's pretty much no secret as to where to get pizza with a group in the FiDi, and even if you're not with a large group, you can always grab a pie and take the rest home because I can attest to their pizza tasting just as good hours later.

My friend brought me here and it was delicious. I had about four slices and had some left over for breakfast the next day.

The scene was beautiful. The pizza had the best flavors and textures I've ever tried.the weather outside was perfect. The waiter was very nice and polite.

I would definitely try this again!

What is life without pizza?! I ordered half OLD FASHIONED-crushed tomatoes, homemade fresh mozzarella, parmesan cheese (added basil) and the WHITE-ricotta & fresh mozzarella. It was thin slice and tasted amazing. There was just enough cheese, it wasn't overbearing. I love the location on Stone Street in the Financial District. It's a great spot if your around the city touring to stop by. They offer indoor and outdoor seating . I ate inside due to the hot weather. It is not too spacious inside, and it's good to go at a time where it isn't packed. Outdoor seating on breezy summer days is an enjoyable time. People are carrying conversations, you hear music or maybe a soccer game is on!  Great place to meet up with a group of friends or bring your family to!

Love love love ! My husband and I are from NJ been living in Texas for about 4 years and when we come visit we NEED our pizza fix and boy does this place hit the spot! We got sangria to start which was delicious and for food we got the old fashioned pizza with pepperoni and sausage we also got the margarita pizza OMG! So so good you can just taste the fresh ingredients and the blast of flavors ! I highly recommend this spot !  The old fashioned pepperoni sausage was my favorite the crust was even flavorful ! I'll be back and you should check it out ! Great experience !

This pizza is solid. One bite score: 8.4. IT's a bit pricey and the wait can be a bit long if your party is more than 2 people.

Wait: We waited about 30 minutes for a table for 3... that never happened. We have to settle for the bar seating.

Food: I read in a review to get the pizza well done. They intentionally undercook their pizza because of the volume they make. So ask them to leave it in the oven for a bit longer to make it extra crispy.

First couple of slices were total bomb. It definitely got soggy toward the end but still good pizza. I recommend eating it quickly before it gets soggy. Also the sausage pie was definitely more well done than the pepperoni. The pepperoni wasn't very crispy when it came straight out of the oven.

Would come back. Good pizza. 5/5. TLDR: 8.4 but get it well done.

I was looking up highly-rated pizza joints near the area of Wall Street and the 9-11 Museum, where we planned to spend the morning. Adrienne's came up and I liked the idea that it was in an area called the Stone St. District - an old cobblestone street that they've turned into a drinking and dining venue.

In dozens of reviews, I'd read about the Old Fashioned pizza. It comes in a rectangular pan about the size of a cookie sheet. It's kind of in-between thick and thin crust. The base price is $25 (crushed tomatoes, homemade mozzarella and parmesan). Toppings cost between $2 - $6 per additional topping. At first I thought that sounded REALLY expensive! But my husband, my two teens and I shared one with pepperoni and sausage and we felt like it was enough. It's possible that some of us could have eaten another slice, but the size it came in still left us satisfied. It's definitely a different style of pizza than the typical New York thin crust slice but we all enjoyed it.

One Monday I had a craving for a pizza from this place.  It was my first time in at over 7 years eating here. I don't eat here because they don't sell individual slices so I have to get friends to join me. It's one of the best thin slices of pizza I have had. But in this case I was alone so I ordered a cheese calzone for $13 and it was huge. Just by looking at it, I was like I can't finish this but the cheese and the bread was divine that I ended up eating the whole thing. I definitely want to come back for happy hour which ends at 6pm on weekdays, I believe. If any of my Yelp friends are in the downtown Fidi area hit me up so we can enjoy some awesome pizza.

Adrienne's Pizzabar is locates in Stone Street in the Financial District. Usually a busy pizzeria/bar, was dead on Christmas Eve.
Mostly known for their old fashioned square pizza which I'm known for loving. However, this time I figured I try something different. I decided to get a round pie. We ordered the margherita with pepperoni (of course).From the looks of it, I was pretty excited to dig in. The pizza was good. The crust was thicker than the usual NY slice. Wished it was crisper and thinner. The pepperoni, although curled the way I like, we're sliced really thin. The sauce was good and the right enough cheese that I would give it a 5.5 pizza rating. Nothing to brag about, but for what we were looking for on Christmas Eve, good enough.

I love Kick Axe. I love it because I love to axe throwing.

I went to a fellow Yelpers axe throwing bio celebration back in February and since then I was hooked. Since that one time I've tried another ace throwing location that I will not name and it was not up to par.

My coworkers organized a group event here at kick axe and I fell in love.

The decor, the instructors, the cleanliness of the location and the fact that they change the boards often is what sold me.

The pricing per session is about $38/39 for 1.5 hours. If you have a larger group (12) you'll receive your own lane. Light snacks (pizza) is sold here and they have lots of beer and canned Ros√©. Unfortunately it is not BYOB like other axe throwing locations but the drink prices are reasonable.

I've been here probably 4 times in the last year and I recently celebrated my birthday with a group of 23 other friends here. I wanted to share my love of axe throwing with my closest friends.

The only complaint I have about this location is the fact that there are no fans or some kind of air conditioning system. I've been here in just about every season and I'm always sweating. Granted yes I'm performing a physical activity but there is never any air circulation. Besides that this place is perrdr to me.

I will 100% return for more axe throwing and who knows maybe I'll join a league or something.

Who knew throwing axes would be so much fun? Initially, I thought it would be difficult but I got the hang of it pretty fast. I think axe throwing might be my calling in life. We registered online and signed waivers as soon as we entered. They have a bar, snacks, and Table 87 pizza while you wait.

The instructors we had were pretty nice and encouraging. Some of the target boards were in pretty bad shape which affected whether or not our axe throws stuck to the board or not, I think. Also, it can get loud and cramped. Also, unless you have a group of 8 or more, you probably have to share two lanes with another group.

They make competitions out of each round and it's pretty fun. I would totally do this again.

I had tons of fun here. All you need is an open mind and enjoy friendly competition. It's like darts but with axes. The cost to play is $35 per person. You can have a group of no more than 12 on a range. That will allow the trainer to break you up into two teams for the games. I have to say, getting the axe to stick in the wood was a challenge, but with practice I definitely got better. The trainer is with you the entire time to give pointers, ensure you are safe and to keep score.

The more people playing the tighter the waiting area on the range becomes. Therefore you can't have any issues with close quarters. Lol.

Kick axe has a bar and offers some food, like pizza.

The main waiting area has some couches, jenga, and connect four.

I went on a Saturday at 7:00 and it was pretty busy.

I think it's worth a try. I only gave 4 stars bc of the time allotments. It's either 1 hour and 15 min or 2 hours and 45min. I feel like I could've used another 1/2 hour on my reservation but the almost 3 hours would've been way too long.

Had a great time bringing a party of 16 first timers (including myself) to Kick Axe this past weekend!

We had to arrive a little early to sign waivers (doesn't take long), and waited with our buzzer until it was our turn. We booked two ranges and had ample time to throw axes which was nice because we had a little corner of the area to ourselves.

The staff were extremely friendly and carefully walked us through do's, dont's on axe throwing and tbh, throwing axe is actually a lot harder than I thought haha

We also played two games to spice things up a bit and definitely got us motivated to get better at axe throwing. The bar was also a great additional to our experience and definitely would come back again.

Great place to have events. The event is fun in which you and your party play at least three round of games against each other. The instructor will use the initial round to teach the party on how to throw axes and proper postures for throwing axes. Later rounds are for fine tuning and to find the best process, force, and dynamic to throw axes. I can see this event as team building event and to build some competition : )

The only con of this place is that they turned the AC so high that it was very cold inside. The super cold feeling wasn't enjoyable... Everything else was fine

One of my favorite unique activities to date! Great beer, good snacks, and AXE THROWING!

For $35pp, you get 75 minutes at the ""range"" with an axe throwing specialist. My boyfriend and I were paired with another couple, and we had a blast. The axe specialist taught us safety and proper throwing techniques for the first few minutes, we had a few practice throws, and then we played games! The axe specialist monitors the games: Who can get to 60 points first, ""21,"" and ""Around the World."" The time flew by so fast while playing games.

The bar is awesome! They serve my favorite cider, ""Austin Eastciders!"" There are also some tasty looking bar snacks.

The interior is rustic meets outdoorsy. Wear your plaid shirts!! There's a cool Photobooth area with great props, Giant Jenga, and Giant Connect 4!

Parking can be a little rough since it's street parking, but it's nothing like trying to find parking in Manhattan.

What a fun time!

I wasn't sure about axe throwing at first... but I'm always down to try something new and my friends wanted to go so it was perfect when they set it all up.  I believe I paid $38 bucks

We went on Friday night and it was actually really busy!

Although I didn't set it up -my friend did who made reservations ahead of time

They tell you to come in 20mins earlier than your time slot to sign paperwork etc

You get a staff member per each group who instructs you, keeps score and helps make sure everyone is safe.

Ax throwing was easier and more fun than I thought!

We played 3 games for our group of 10 and used two booths. Area to place drinks , sit and hang coats/purses

They tell you to bring closed shoes - if not they have shoes to borrow ( ehh) .... just wear sneakers or something lol . Wear comfortable clothes . I had to take my hat off because it was getting in the way of me throwing

My throws at the end were so much better than my original throws

Our staff member Chip was awesome! He was friendly and helped us be safe. He have tips on how to throw better!

You could get drinks and food if you want....
I didn't because I knew we were going to grab dinner and drinks after

Inside was cute ... like a trendy lumberjack lodge lol

You can play games and take photos in the waiting area

They have several bathroom stalls

I really had a good time.... actually better than I thought . Would definitely try it again.

This is a lot of fun! I've never done this before and found the experience really well run, educational, and a great group activity. Also they do a great job making sure this is safe, after a couple throws you won't feel nervous at all.

Throwing the axe  is different than you would expect. It's not a sport where you want to use a lot of power, you actually do better throwing slowly and gently. I guess this is a bit like darts.

Each ally gets a host who runs a series of games. The games can be 21, where you have to get exactly 21 points to win, or just first team to 40 points. The host we had was really funny and helped us learn how to throw better by constantly giving us pointers.

There's a full bar and food available at the facility  as well.

Definitely give it a shot if you have a group that wants to have an interesting evening!

This place is wonderful, I came here with a group of friends for a birthday, 13 people in total. Being the unorganized group of people that we all, we all bought our tickets online separately. Fearing we would have been with a random group, I called to ask them if we could be grouped. They let us know that adding a hostname in the checkout will let them know the party is together.

The atmosphere was fun, we got there around 10 PM for our 10:30 appointment. It was super packed but after a while, the rush started to leave. They have a bar there which is awesome, they also have some seating near the entrance with board games and a giant connect four.

The event lasts for about an hour and 15 mins. Our instructor (Will) was super awesome and gave us a safety demo and we had some practice runs before the games began. Overall it was a great time and a very enjoyable experience will go back again.

I went here for my friends 30th birthday! This place is awesome! This place is also pretty well organized.

I walked here from atlantic terminal, it took about 10 minutes (pretty convenient for fellow mta riders).

They have a cute outdoor area that we did not take advantage of since the weather was very cold but it had a huge bull and some nice high top tables to hang out at.( maybe I'll be back in the summer next).

Inside the team welcomes you and assists you in finding an iPad and signing there waver. Then you can have a beer or cider and lounge on one of the couches or tables. Or maybe take pics with some props while you wait for your session to begin. This was great for us since we had a big group of 21. They even had board games like jenga.

This spot has light food like pizza and a great array of craft beer. Got your safety don't drink too much, I just had one cider here.

Then for the best part we got 4 lanes since we were a big group and got to throw axes! Throwing an axe is quite challenging and even when you think you got the hang of it you might still strike out the next time. We had a blast learning how to throw and competing in the different array of games they set up for us to keep us motivated to win. Our instructors were great and kept everything lively, light and fun.

Kick Axe thanks for making my friends 30th a night to remember. I will definitely be back in the near future to throw again!

Who knew throwing axes could be so fun. Not only was it a great time but I also feel like I'm very prepared in the event of a zombie apocalypse. Ax will probably be my weapon of choice.
To get your ax throwing experience started you sign up online (and pay) for the day and time you want. Online you can see how many slots are available per time slot. I recommend not waiting until the last minute to book because you're preferred time may be full. They recommend You get there early to sign a waiver.
Each session is 90 minutes and the entire time you have an ax-pert with you. Teaching you how to throw, giving your pointers, leading the games and keeping score. I've done this twice so far and it's so much fun. Don't forget to tip your axpert.

So this was an outing with my staff and it was and good gathering with not a lot of pressure. I wish they had more snack or food options but despite that it was a good spot. It was a tad bit warm I know it's cold outside right now but I need venues in general in NY to understand when everyone is inside and throwing objects the are gonna g wet hot. Please keep it cool And comfortable and not a toaster inside.

Our coach Jared was awesome super personable and nice. He helped everyone get their optimum throwing abilities so we could have the most fun.

Very busy place. Stopped by here one Sunday afternoon with a group of 6. Reservations are made prior and payment is required during that time (we paid $38/per).
They paired us up with an Australian family and gave us a guide. Every group has a guide to avoid injuries and they never leave you.
He'll spend some time explaining how to properly throw the hatchet, where to stand, hand position and such. He'll then ask everyone to try to get a feel of it. Throwing hatchets is something that gets easier the more you do it.  So we practiced for a bit then competed with the Australian family.
Food wise we o lot had some beers and this weird hot chocolate drink in a can that tastes pretty good. I think it's from Belgium and they know chocolate so no wonder it was good.

Overall, I'll come here again. Good atmosphere and vibe for some fun.

I dig it, if you axed me.

Space is ""cool"" and rustic - basically bare bones but still clean and comfortable. They have plenty of ranges but it gets REALLY loud. It's really fun depending on your group. The axeperts are friendly, professional, fun and helpful. With a big group, it DOES go by quick and you don't throw as much but it's still a good amount to try and to get better. Once you get the hang of the throw and start hitting some targets, it feels awesome. The space also has a lounge area w games if you wanted to chill after or before.

They don't sell hard liquor but have some beers and seltzer's and wine.

All staff is knowledgeable and you feel safe (somewhat...) ;)

Good time all around!

A friend of mine wanted to mix things up from the norm for his birthday so he decided we should hurl axes in hipster Brooklyn. I'd been here before and thought this was a great idea for a social way to spend some time with a group of friends where we weren't made to scream over club/bar music or be confronted with sitting at a table limiting who we interacted with.

We had a little area to ourselves right up front and had a fun ax-master who led us through a few games. Alcoholic drinks are only served one-at-a-time which is a somewhat annoying policy when we're trying to play a game and are time-constrained. Snack food choices are very limited, but it works because there's a Dinosaur BBQ a couple of blocks away that's a perfect next stop from here.

The only real gripe one can have is paying $35+tax+tip per person to our ax-master in a group of 8 where the pressure seems to be ""on"" to try to get adequate value out of the 75 minute ""lane"" rental. The price per person should probably scale differently when there are so many people on a lane.

Anyway, fun place with a good energy. I'd recommend it, but definitely make a reservation for prime nights/weekends because you'll need it.

I've never thrown an axe in my life, but thanks to Kick Axe Throwing, I can actually say I've not only done it but I love it. I am not saying I have a natural affinity to throwing these axes, but somehow I find the whole process quite therapeutic. They are pioneers for the NYC area and easily among the best at it.

Prior to this amazing Brooklyn spot, I had never heard of axe throwing as a thing. Fast forward close to a year later, there are places opening up left and right with the same premise and now there's even a Yelp dedicated category just for these types of businesses.

I don't think one should ever come here without a decent group of people. It's a great way to bond with others, a fun nightlife oriented activity that is beyond the bar (though they do serve adult beverages!), and great way to destress.

A few tips:

* First timer? Don't worry, there is always a staff person monitoring the space and will act both as an instructor and referee for games.

* Try to show up on time, preferably 15 minutes prior. Paying $35 a person and only throwing an axe for a short time can be a real drag.

* Groups of 16 will always get their own exclusive area. Smaller groups might be combined with others. Nothing beats networking over axe throwing.

* Drinking is not going to help one's game, but it's fun anyway. Food is also available, but outside catering is okay as long as it's been pre-arranged with their special events coordinator.

Love Love Love this place!
.
If you're looking for a date night activity, just a casual hang out with family & friends or celebrating something that's filled with a rush of adrenaline & fun, @kickaxethrowing is definitely a must do
.
The kick axe sessions have their Pros that teach the basics for about 10-15 minutes and then you get to compete in some fun games against your friends or enemies. The Axe Pro is with you throughout the experience to assist and help keep score.
.
The ambiance is like a cozy cabin with a bar to grab drinks at, couches to chill on & props to dress up as vikings to take pics in Either way, it def worth checking out at least once!

Wow, so so fun!!! Had a blast here especially with our leader (blanking on his name). It wasn't expensive for what it was. Had plenty of good beers and wines to drink too. Chill atmosphere and fun to do with a couple friends.

I liked that you could also venmo your leader so they can get paid! I had no cash :) will be back

Went there to celebrate my birthday during the winter. Sure was an unique experience that will bring me back. My instructor was very friendly and helpful in learning how to properly throw. Loved the small competition at the end.

What a fantastic location.  Kick Axe Throwing is VERY well taken care of establishment.  From the second you walk in to the minute you walk out you are surrounded by exactly what you think you would be.  Wood, beer, and fabulous fabric, deer heads, and lots of 10"" pizza options for $14 each.

Don't have enough people in your group to start a tournament? No problem! Kick Ass Throwing will assemble a tourney for you!

1. Price: $$-$$$
2. Tipping $: Remember to bring cash to bring your ""Axepert"" or individual who leads your tournament. There is no where for you to leave a credit card tip!
3. Food: 10"" Pizza's and snacks galore!
4. Beer/Wine: Great list of beers and wines to enjoy while you're kicking axe.  You CAN drink while you throw!
5. MUST WEAR CLOSED TOED SHOES.  If you do not they have bins of shoes labeled, ""shoes of shame"" that you are welcome to.  No one is turned away.  The shoes of shame aren't fashionable but they are comfortable!  If you're coming from the office in heals- fear not!

Overall, a great place for a birthday, bachelorette or bachelor party, or a night out after a long day at the office.  Two axes up!!

Axe me how I like it... I loved this!! I've heard of people doing this more often lately and glad I tried it! It's super fun, I did need to get the hang of it and didn't get the board the first few times. But they walk you through it, the instructors are engaging enough for needing to walk you through demos and safety rules, and they give you tips to help you throw better. You don't get any safety gear and our group did have a couple times where the axe kinda bounced back toward you. but it wasn't really that dangerous, at least imo. No one got hurt or even close! Overall I thought it was a really fun activity, good for team building and friendly competition, but the time does go by quick!!

My office came here for a team outing last week and had a blast! I don't venture out to Brooklyn much and have never gone anywhere other than Williamsburg, but I enjoyed the hike over. The outside of the space looks super cool with a little patio and painted garage doors.

As soon as I stepped inside, I was transported to a lodge style setting and was immediately greeted by the sounds of axe throwing, something else I'd never ventured into. Our group signed our waivers, headed in to nosh on the cold and stale lunches we unfortunately did not get to eat in the office, and listened as the axe pros laid down the rules and explained the games and techniques.

We split up into 3 ranges and played amongst our groups with our axe pro encouraging and roasting us all the same the whole time. It was a great time and definitely a fun bonding experience!

There's not much that I love more than getting drunk and flinging very sharp, heavy objects around. I used to just do it at my home and the homes of various friends...but since some of us have had children, we've started throwing the children instead, and throwing knives and such has fallen a bit by the wayside.

Luckily, Kick Axe is here for me.

It's just a good time. The space is comfortable, large, well-decorated in contemporary log-cabin chic, and perfect for throwing some axes. If you've never been, there will be an axpert ready to show you how to do it. After a little instruction, you'll be able to show your friends how much more valuable you'd be in a zombie apocalypse.

You definitely have to reserve some space beforehand because they are just about always busy. I would also recommend showing up on time as opposed to getting too drunk at dinner and only having about 15 minutes when you paid for an hour, but that's your call. You might be better off just bringing in Dinosaur BBQ or something else from down the street, as opposed to trying to wrangle your irresponsible friends into a certain place at a certain time.

If I have one complaint, it's that it's beer/wine only, and that they only allow you to grab one at a time. That last part may only have been for us though, as SOMEONE was visibly drunk.

It may have been me.

Came here with a group of friends in July to celebrate my friend's birthday.  Even though I arrived late, I was able to join my group.  The instructor gave me instructions on how to throw the ax and retrieve it safely.  We had so much fun.  They had food and adult beverages also.  This is definitely a fun activity.

Came here with large group and I gotta say this place is so much fun. Kick Axe is friggin amazing. Definitely have to book before hand to reserve a spot for your group. Once you arrive with you entire party, you guys get situated in your area and every group gets a great ""axer-pert"" axe thrower who does a stellar job explaining the do's and don'ts of axe throwing. The instructors are comical but they stress the importance of safety so you don't get hurt. Other than that they give you a quick lesson on how to properly throw and axe and you are one your way to an hour of a hella good time.

You play various games through the hour of axe throw. All the games rely on scoring points on the axe board, kinda like darts, except this is a huge knarly axe you chuck at this wooden bullseye.

Honestly a great spot to hang with friends and have a fun/unique axe throwing experience. There's also a bar! so drink responsibly and have a great time!

Fun fun fun! This was my first time ever doing anything like this. I had no idea where I was going so I came pretty dressed up. Thought my heels would hold me back but once you view my pics and videos, you'll see that I dont play around when it comes to challenges lol

Ronnie (I hope that is his name) rocked! He had alot of energy and kept us all entertained. I was  nervous at first but once I got the hang of things no one could stop me. Shout out to my personal coach who gave me extra tips (Kei)  I ended up winning!!

There are couches around the place where you can lounge around until it's your time to play. We played jenga while we waited. I believe there were other little games to play too. This is a must. Probably better to go with a group but 1 on 1 was perfect too. They will put you in a group even if you came with 1other person. There are a few different challenges they set you up to do. Everyone gets to practice a few times, then the fun begins. Our little VIP area was cool.

There are no cocktail drinks- just beers and wines.

There aren't many activities that are both fun and preparation for the end of the world. But throwing axes is definitely one of them.

To be honest, I thought it was just a fad, but judging by the gigantic corporate crowd on a Friday afternoon, they're still doing great! I'm guessing this constant sense of impending doom has something to do with it.

I was here around when they first opened for a Yelp Event (read my thoughts here: yelp.com/biz/elite-event‚Ä¶), and it's still as fun as I remembered.

Every time I tell people about this place, their reaction is always ""axes and alcohol shouldn't mix"". But guess what? They do! Luckily, they also have safety precautions to prevent accidents. Trust your axpert! Ours was Tom, and he was a cool dude.

Speaking of drinks, they got beers and now they have this weird thing that's whatever the opposite of a refrigerator is. A heater? I dunno, but you can get canned hot chocolate or canned hot coffee. I went with their Stumptown cold brew, which was a whopping $7.50 for an 8 oz can. Luckily, it was on the work tab!

Also because it was a work event, I won't begrudge them for being successful. But the groups next to us were gigantic and kept encroaching into our space.

The one thing I will fault them for was our board was pretty torn up before we started, and because we're so talented, we basically destroyed the bullseye and could no longer reasonably hit any halfway through. They definitely replace them often (we could see/hear them drilling nonstop for the first 10-15 minutes we were there), so I guess we got the short end of that stick.

But all in all, a fun place to bring a group!

Four stars for the fun, three for the food and beer selection.  All in, I definitely had a fun time and want to go again, but it's fairly pricey, and then they want tips at the end as well.  Don't see that changing, however, as it was crazy busy.

The venue itself can accomodate a lot of throwers, and does so in a way that seems as safe as a venue where you throw axes could be. It was hard to move around, however. The axes are in good shape, easy to throw (seemed like everyone playing had at least intermittent success/bullseyes), and our ""Axpert"" who stayed with us and coached /refereed the entire time was very helpful and nice.

The food...? We had a pizza, and it was expensive, tiny and terrible.  Not just mediocre...terrible.  Notably worse than frozen pizza from the grocery store. I imagine no one ever orders a second..

The beer selection had quite a few options, but mostly ones for a younger crowd.  I would like to have seen some more local Brooklyn options as well.

TRUST ME, JUST DO IT.

I promise you won't regret it, and you're bound to have a great time. The venue used to be a performance space called Littlefield a couple years ago, and I love what Kick Axe Throwing has done with it in terms of d√©cor! Very warm, rustic interior. Perfect for a wintertime date.

You must purchase a reservation in advance, and once you're there an ""Axepert"" will go through the safety policies and teach you the appropriate axe-throwing techniques. Afterwards, your group will be split into two for some fun games. For amount of time spent, you definitely get your money's worth.

Plenty of craft beers available, and a comfy lounge with board/card games to play if you still want to hang out afterwards. I highly recommend if you're the competitive type, enjoy novelty activities, or just want to do something a little different!

We had a great time. It was my friends birthday and we came here to celebrate on a rainy Monday night. Lawrence was great. He was able to teach us very well and we all enjoyed our time there. It was fun because they had different rounds and different rules for each round. He was super funny and chill and definitely had a great time. Would come back and recommend!

I'd never heard about this until my husband came home from his trip to NYC and told me about this place that someone took him out to.

Great place to hang out with friends or big parties! There were only 4 of us, so we got 2 other people joining our group.

First we signed the waiver and ordered our drinks then the instructor came to collect us and took us to the the area. I've got to say, our instructor was SO hilarious while half the time being super serious while giving us instructions and tips. We were divided into 2 teams and I did pretty well a couple of times. We had a lot of laughs and giggles. I didn't drink much because I was really worried I could have hurt myself, but it was really safe!

I would definitely do it again if I'm in the area. I mean, when you're in Brooklyn, don't miss out on the Axe Throwing shenanigan!

This place is not too far from the subways. It's in the walking distance. Also, you can easily walk from Park Slope, get food there and come here, just like we did!

What a blast! My boyfriend and I went on a surprise date after finding them on Groupon and had so much fun! We were there early in the morning and so our session was just us and we had so much fun! We played games, competed, laughed, listened to music! We didn't have food or snacks there but everything was clean and the employees were great and answering all question. We felt safe throughout the time there and we did not have a single issue. Highly recommend and would absolutely come again

I am so happy that this place was open and we were able to celebrate my husband's birthday. It was safe and clean. We had to wear masks the entire time unless we wanted to take a sip of our drinks. We had an amazing instructor as well. Definitely would recommend as something fun and unique to do.

The only reason this place has ""good reviews"" is because the company freaks out if they get a bad one and try to bribe the customers to removing/changing their post.

Its expensive, crowded, loud, and the entire experience is rushed.
The staff looks miserable screaming the same stupid script over the noise/shitty music - management looks inexperienced.
All they care about is money. they book as much as possible and don't even have time to change the beat up boards which makes it impossible to stick the axe

They have a decent selection of beer but the ""snacks"" are a joke.
They have a microwave at the bar!!!! LOL

I've been encouraging my friends, family and coworkers to not give them business.  Just a bunch of Caucasian transplants appealing to the other NY transplants. It's like a scene out of Get Out the second you walk in there. Corny decor, stupid props, overpriced everything and fake smiles.
Will never give my money to this place again, there are far better establishments (more rustic, not ""pretty"") Support NON gentrified businesses.

Bar Tabac is doing their best to stay in business which is a huge challenge since all of their table service is now outside their restaurant. The restaurant is only open if you need to use their bathrooms. It's a little eerie walking inside their darkened dinning and bar area but their bathrooms were clean and they had plenty of soap as well as disinfectants both inside and outside their restaurant.  The service was excellent. Their waiters were respectful and kept their distance. They also were very generous by encouraging us to sit and schmooze long after we had finished eating our lunch.  I though their portions were sizable and the chicken wrap I ate was exceptionally delicious!

Our meal at Bar Tabac was a mixed bag, hence the three stars.  They have loads of outdoor seating and it is quite pleasant.  We started with cocktails that were good, and a country pate plate that was very tasty.  For mains, I tried the steak tartare- I'm a sucker for a good tartare- and my husband got a seafood risotto.  I thought a risotto was odd for a French bistro, but it was very good: the sauce was a amazing and the seafood was well cooked.  The tartare was not so great.  It had hot sauce mixed in, which basically killed the taste of the steak, and there were no toasts to spread the tartare on.  On the plus side, the frites were nice, as was the watercress salad, although the salad was overdressed.  I ordered a glass of wine with my meal and the waiter- who in fairness seemed a bit overwhelmed- brought me another cocktail instead.  Not sure how he mixed that up.  Not sure I would give this place another try.

Is Tabac French for COCKROACH?

Long story short: Minutes after getting our dinner, a HUGE cockroach ran across the wall above our heads. We didn't want to make a big deal, the waiter killed it with his hand? We lost our appetites and hurried up to finish our glass of wine and leave. No one checked in on us, no one mentioned it, no one cared that we had not even been half way through our meal.

THEN A SECOND COCKROACH FELL FROM THE CEILING AND ON TO THE SHOULDER OF THE WOMAN NEXT TO US! We all freaked out, stood up, didn't know what to do. Once again, no one cared or even asked what was going on until we told them. They asked both parties if we wanted to move tables?

The kicker: The manager walked past us while we were recovering from the falling roach and asked ""Are you guys from New York or.....?""

In my seven years of living and eating in NYC, I have never seen one, let alone TWO, live roaches inside of a restaurant.

Not a penny was comped, no one checked in to see if we were okay, they carried on business as usual and my skin is still crawling. Only eat here if you are also a roach.

Food has gone down hill. The place has roaches crawling in and around the restaurant. The management and staff continue to not wear masks and social distance. They has been so irresponsible during and negligent the pandemic...it's pathetic. I will not be coming back. I won't miss being seated in the very back next to the rancid smelling toilet.

The food is meh at best. But more important, they are awful community members. They have been jerks throughout the pandemic, putting out hi-tops and tables since April, and encouraging people to hang around maskless.  It's not even Phase 2 as I write this, so they have no excuse.  Many members of the community have tried to speak to management, only to be dismissed.

If you want to support local businesses, you can do a lot better than this one.  They don't deserve your support.

It's rare to find an unpretentious bistro in NYC - from passing by Bar Tabac on Smith Street, it seemed to fit the bill, and so I was glad to finally confirm my suspicions over brunch on a recent weekend.

The inside is perhaps not quite as quaint as some of the pricier French bistro mainstays in Manhattan, but I appreciate the Parisian street signs hanging from the walls, and when it isn't boiling outside, sitting on the sidewalk is probably the move.

I had a cheddar and tomato omelette, which was stupendous. Not overly ""eggy,"" which is sadly rare to find in an omelette. The home fries were perfectly seasoned, with what tasted like bits of caramelized onion sprinkled throughout.

This neighborhood bo√Æte has a full bar, serves lunch and dinner, and features live music in the evenings. And did I mention that their food is amazing? It is.

Came for lunch and being a Saturday we got the brunch menu. All good since we wanted mussels which thankfully was on the menu.
Mrs ordered mojito and me Stella. Both satisfactory drinks, then next up were the mussels and fries.
Piled high were plump mussels in a wine wine sauce which was exactly what we craved today. Nice crusty bread was perfect to sop up the excess juice. Fries were salty not too much, just right!
Service was quick even though the place was packed, not an empty seat on the house. They have been a neighborhood staple for years and if the mussels reflect the rest of the menu then you can't go wrong here. Be aware cash or AMEX only!!!

I've been here a few times & each time I tell myself I'm going to get something different. But I always end up getting the mussels & fries. Their service is always very good & attentive. The drink menu is very good. Tip: they only accept cash & AMEX, no other cards, so bring cash. Or go to the ATM in the back.

Not going to recommend, not going to not recommend. First off, when we entered the restaurant it was so loud that we could barely talk to the waitress to get our table, and when we got there we ordered a pellegreeno (which came instantly) and a sprite (which did not come for another 10-15 minutes.) The sprite was most likely the worst part of this visit. When I tried it, it was so watery and flat I sent it back afterward the first sip.

When the food finally came like half an hour later, it was pretty bad. First off I ordered a cheeseburger with French fries. The French fries were overly salted and tasted stall and  and old. The burger was actually pretty good, but chewy and burnt at the edges and falling apart at the bun and sliding at the same time.

Not to mention the bread was AWFUL! I honestly couldn't believe that anyone would serve something that stale and old. Let's discuss the staffing, I personally didn't like the provocative women in revealing outfits on the walls and on some of the staffs t shirts.

I personally wouldn't come back to this restaurant, and definitely don't think anyone should take a party of picking (or normal for this matter) eaters. Also taking of parties there was no joke a loud party of like 15 people that were squishing into our table.

Oh and a side note, from our table we couldn't even see the live music! Just a wall that seemed decretive and un needed. So I'm going to be take back what I initially said in the beginning of my review, I would defiantly not recommend this pub/bar/ripoff to anyone!!!?!?!!

- Thanks, The Karen Of Yelp

The interior is pleasant and the waitstaff were very friendly and did a great job with explaining the menu.  The owner or manager (not sure who) also checked up on us a few times which was nice and not typical like with other restaurants.  Everyone in my party enjoyed their food but I was disappointed with my mussels entry because they were dry and had no flavor.  It seems that the chef didnt mix them well prior to serving or they stood around for too long and the juices dripped down.

My wife and I sat down at a table for dinner at the only available table outside. It happened to be next to a speaker at full volume blaring music outside for 'ambiance' - to the point where we could not hear each other speak. I politely asked our waitress if a number of things could be done: 1) what is the wait time for the next available table? 2) could we move the speaker direction so it was not facing our direction directly at our ears and possibly 3) could we turn the volume down. The response for all three was that it was not possible. Well, we kindly responded in kind that it was not possible to dine there. This was not the first negative experience we have had at Bar Tabac. Their set up for the French world cup on Smith St. was abysmal. But, with this latest experience, I am 100% confident it will be our last.

Bar Tabac is over rated and over priced in the best of times, but now they are putting the neighborhood at risk by deifying the laws to be take-out only. They are encouraging crowds to gather outside, blocking sidewalks with people not wearing masks. Their staff shows little care for health rules, with many of them not wearing masks, and their management is openly ignoring the Covid mandates.

Superb French bar with live music on some nights (Thursdays I believe) that draws a diverse, mature crowd from friends to lovers and solo diners/drinkers stopping in for a nightcap. The bartender (originally from Croatia) was delightful and great company. The band of the night was a mix of Montr√©al and France and cranked out some nice tunes and a few en fran√ßais.

I've only been twice now, but it's always a good stop in. They carry Duvel which is a favorite and even a Pastis de Marseille if you want to get real local and real Marseillais and have a thing for anise (I don't). Stop in for some all around good vibes, good music and maybe even good French food (didn't try).

Bar tabac, √† bient√¥t.

Came here for lunch with a party of 12 after running the Brooklyn marathon. Needless to say two of us were beyond starving. They didn't have our reservation on the list although we called in a day or two prior l, but fortunately they were able to accommodate us in the back room. Chic French bar with some good food options. My fianc√© and I had the Ni√ßoise salad, the escargot, and the Mediterranean eggs. The food was great, especially the eggs. They also had a wide variety of vegan drinks that some of the party took advantage off. I had a regular Bloody Mary and it was good. I would definitely come back to try their brunch.

My favorite burger bistro in NYC.  Makes me feel like I'm back in Montmartre at a corner spot people watching from the sidewalk table.  Welcoming waiters and bartenders, good wines by the glass, and great live music!  The chicken, goat cheese salad, mussels, everything has been spot on.  Plus it's a local spot that throws a mean block party for Bastille Day.  Regulars, happy hour, really glad Bar Tabac stands the test of time.  Delicious, merci!

On the burger hunt, you have to sample Bar Tabac for the bun alone.  Grilled onion and Rosemary embedded!  The burger is outstanding, always flavorful, cooked to order, cheese is what you'd expect in a true French bistro, fries and salad included and so good.  Plus you get live music, an outdoor seating option and great wine and beers at decent prices. Love the Tabac.

I have been to this place quite a few time because I quite like it. The food is good and it has a cute atmosphere. Always get the escargot and pate because they are both very tasty.

The service is quite relaxed but there can be a difference in how I feel about it after my meal. Most of the time its great but sometimes it feels like there is no soul.

The most recent time I was there, we had a fun waitress called Marya who was very engaging and obviously cared about our experience. Even though she forgot a few items over the meal (which was rectified when we asked her about them), this didn't detract from our overall experience because she was apologetic, and fixed it immediately.

The missing star is because once we were seated, no one came to look after us or take our drink orders for 20 minutes. We were sitting outside so not directly in sight of the wait staff. I think we even approached a porter but they didn't pay any attention to us. Eventually, we were able to get Maryas attention, who apologized and explained that this wasn't her table but will look after us from now on.

I know from years of being in this industry that there needs to be a floor plan for the restaurant, but making sure everyone is working as a team is more important than table allocation.

Either way, I think this place is great but they could work on the customer experience to enhance the meal.

Good late-night French-inspired street-corner bar / restaurant with lovely sidewalk seating and a noisy, friendly and happy crowd inside. Liquor, wine and beer flow freely here late at night and is enjoyed standing or seated at one of several bar-height tables -- all conducive to lots of interaction, loud conversation, toasting and high-fiveing.  I hear the food is good, although we were there for late evening drinks only. One restroom only however guarantees a long wait to pee.

Ok food, nothing  to write home about.
The server was nice but slow, he forgot our order and came back to apologize and offered us champagne, that was nice but not ideal.
They also took a million years to take our cash (no credit cards accepted) and bring back the change.
They didn't have skim milk or a espresso machine (just an FYI for coffee drinkers).
Ambiance was great, live music was a plus.
Would come back but wouldn't order coffee or be in a hurry.

I had relatively high expectations for this place, but the reality was mixed. Nice rustic atmosphere in Cobble Hill, with live music during dinner. And that was the first problem: far too loud because of the (unnecessary) amplification, so that conversation becomes impossible, and listening is a bit hurtful to one's ears. (And when the band is not playing their piped music is just as loud!) Food okay, and not overpriced. Try the charcuteries plate (or the combo with cheese). Good Nicoise salad. The free range chicken came with roasted potatoes that were so salty as to be almost inedible. There is much room for improvement, folks!

The owner is very fun and energetic, and that's very refreshing to see. He also educated us on some stuff. The food was good. It's a little crowded where I heard the conversation about computer systems from the table next to me. For the appetizers we ordered foie gras, calamari, and escargot. The foie gras was accompanied by beautiful spread and nice amount of bread. It was more of a pate consistency rather than the usual hard peaces we are used to. However, it was delicious and I'm sure that there are numerous ways of preparing it. For the entree we ordered mussles and steak. My steak was delicious with pepper sauce, but you have to ask for it and it's 2.50 extra. The mussels were good, but hubby felt they were a little dry on top. Their fries are the best fries that I had in a long time, and the owner basically gave us the recipie. This is definatly not a 3.5 star place unlike yelp review total. It a good place, and I really recomend you try this place and see for yourself. I'll be back for their famous burger.

I love love love sitting outdoors at Bar Tabac and having a Croque-Madame with frites, salad, and their sparkling lemonade.

Reading a book and watching the goings-on of Smith and Dean streets. Now that's enjoying life, European-style! (When it's warm enough. If not I sit indoors and admire the strange designs on the ceiling; usually the same meal.)

Idk why this place has 3 & 1/2 stars because it's literally so good. I licked my plate clean. The food is fresh, organic, free range which makes it even better. The food never fails. They make everything fresh and you can control sweetness with drinks which is awesome.

We sat for an hour without food. When the tables to the right and left of us -- who ordered after we did -- I asked the waiter if the kitchen was still ""cooking"" the 2 orders of steak tartare we asked for. And still the food did not arrive.

Poor service. We walked out.

There's a lot to like about Bar Tabac. There's a cool zest to the atmosphere flaunting a colorful and funky, French Bistro flair that's neither stuffy or extravagant, but, it's somewhat, rustic and a little intimate in a not-so-typical sense of the word.

Bar Tabac is rough around the edges in a very nice sort of way; with French chachkies and memorabilia throughout the restaurant. Service was very personal and we chit chatted with Jonas, who was very welcoming, attentive and made sure our dining experience would be great...

**Heads up people:
1. Unisex restroom and unkept
2. Only AMEX accepted

But what tops that is the great taste in food and drinks. Food at Bar Tabac is freshly prepared giving you rich flavors. My Seafood Risotto had delicate chunks of crab meat and topped with shrimp and scallops. My husband's hanger steak was nearly cooked to perfection dressed in a delicious wine jus. My husband's steak was nicely paired with a mushroom risotto- which, I almost ate half (since it was placed off to one side and away from the steak).

Tabac has been our go-to when we're in the area. Can't stop just yet.

A chicken of gold. Aptly named, as this spot has been consistently good since moving to Brooklyn 5 years ago.

Pollo a la brasa is the move, and we order in frequently, but on this fine afternoon with my girlfriend and our friends, we did sandwiches, sangria, and ceviche. The rotisserie chicken sandwich featured that aji verde (you're welcome, it's called aji verde. Don't be one of those green sauce people. It has a name and is definitely amazing enough to merit being called by its name) with mozzarella. Totally bomb.

Supplements included cheese and beef empanadas - seasoned to perfection and fried to the crispest golden brown. Ceviche was fresh and not shy with the garlic - just amazing.

Service was nicely paced and they even let our puppy sit with us outside!

Do not sleep on this spot. Support your local businesses, like PDO and be safe!

Rotisserie chicken was pretty good with their green sauce. They were generous with their extra green sauce upon request. Their sweet plantains were to die for, crispy on the edges and ripened just right where they weren't soggy. I wasn't much of a fan of their fried yuca, they were cut a little too thick and very dry and hard to bite into. Will be back to order take out again!

It's still warm enough for outdoor dining! There's plenty of seats here and [most of] the food is delish. We shared a quarter chicken with yucca as an appetizer bc we're fatties. I forgot to request the leg of the chicken but was shocked at how tasty and juicy the breast was. I've had bad experiences with yucca but theirs was fried perfectly with a light crunch outside and soft on the inside. The green sauce is a big YES. I am trying to be healthier so I ordered the salmon, which was served with a bed of green rice with onions on top. Delish and I didn't fall victim to food coma after.

Dropped a star because my husband wasn't a fan of his entree, the tacu tacu steak. The rice with the egg on top was good but the steak itself was small, really thin, dry and overcooked. We even asked the server what she recommended and she had suggested the tacu tacu! Will try something else next time.

I placed my order with YELP DELIVERY. COM.
ALL I wanted was a green salad dressing on the side,
1/4 chicken dark meat with yellow rice and beans. I should have canceled the order as soon as they called and said we are not able to deliver. Okay I will come and pick it up. Fifteen minutes later I  arrived and they still did not reduce my bill: delivery charges and tips. For what??? The service charge for trying out this online ordering I guess is nonrefundable. Fifteen minutes later I opened my order to find an overdone chicken breast and pale gummy yellow rice. The beans undercooked but the salad was acceptable. POLLO D'SASTER. NEVER AGAIN.

I came here with my friend (and his puppy) for lunch before hitting Brooklyn Bridge Park. I made a reservation the night before on Opentable, but at the time we arrived it wasn't necessary. Most tables have an umbrella over it, but the restaurant should honestly invest in some better umbrellas. Our's would not stay up properly and did not have enough weight on the bottom so it would tip over whenever the wind blew.

Order:
- Pollo Saltado (4/5)
- Tallarines Saltado w/ Chicken (4/5)

Pros:
- Good tasting food
- A lot of options to choose from
- Nice service
- They let you dine with your pets outdoor

Cons:
- Dry chicken
- Slow service ~ it took us a while to finally put our order in and get our check
- Need to invest in better umbrellas or maybe get a tent for covered outdoor dining

Overall: The food tasted great, but not the best outdoor setup

What a little gem I found ! Such a great spot for food , drinks and great music . Made reservations for 12pm on a Saturday and my party of 4 was one of two parties in the whole restaurant. I felt very safe and the staff checked my temperature and wore masks at all times . My party and I did the brunch drinks , which is mimosa or sangria for an hour and a half for $22 - Ah Ma Zing ! We had a few appetizers including the grilled octopus, la papa a la huancaina , empanadas de carne and ensalada de la casa( green house salad )  - all so good ! For entree I had the lomo saltado and it was delicious . The dessert was also amazing we did the ice cream . I would 1000% come back and recommend this spot . Service was top notch .

I stopped in here with my mom and boyfriend one really chilly Fall day in order to escape the cold. Because of this reason, I did not eat (I was not hungry) but my mom did have a cup of coffee and some tamales. I had a drink.

From my mom's comment, the coffee was good and the tamales were delicious. It's clear that this is a Peruvian restaurant, as the tamales were ""Peruvian"" styled. I had a cocktail and while I don't remember the name, I know it had Pisco (hellooo if I'm in a Peruvian restaurant, I am going to have a Peruvian drink lol) and it was really good. I thought the prices were reasonable for the location; it's a spot I certainly did not expect to find but I'm glad I did!

Will say kudos to this place still operating in this environment and doing a good job managing outdoor dining.

With that being said, in my mind this place is on par with Peruvian food I've had in the past, but it's nothing special. Tried the lomo saltado and a few things stood out to me:

1) A bit acidic and tomato forward. I think the sauce and dish overall could have used more salt to balance out.
2) Steak was pretty dry and there was very little of it. There was an over abundance of red onions, which provided a nice crunch but didn't add much more than texture. Could have used more cilantro  too to be honest.
3) The fries had a nice crisp but I didn't get the feeling that these were made at the restaurant. Not that they have to be but had a bit of a frozen fries feel to them.

Overall the waitress was accommodating and it's in a nice not crowded location. May not come back again but was worth trying.

I was craving something like pollo campero and as a Miamian in NYC, I naturally looked for a Peruvian restaurant and stumbled upon Pollo D'Oro in Downtown Brooklyn.
The place was decorated nicely and the ambiance was good (a lot more high end that the Peruvian restaurants I had been to in Miami, which are more casual) only complaint is that when we went the Peru - Brazil game was playing and it was extremely loud! Husband and I had to scream at each other.
Husband ordered the Lomo Saltado with fries and I ordered 1/4 of a chicken with french fries. The taste of the chicken was good but only the top skin, the inside was very bland.
Husband said his Lomo Saltado was good, although not the best he has had.
The prices were reflective of any restaurant in DB.
We had a decent experience and the menu had a lot of variety so we may come back again.

The food and drinks were just that good. We had the Tacu Tacu steak (ribeye with sweet plantains and rice and beans risotto) and the Arroz con Mariscos ( well seasoned paella with calamari, shrimp and mussels). Both dishes were delicious. The steak was the perfect medium well steak. Not too pink and it was easy the cut. The paella was flavorful rice filled with an array of seafood. I loved how they put a flower to decorate your food . This restaurant is surrounded by floor to ceiling glass. The ambiance is low key and romantic. The service was pretty prompt. The cocktails are solid here too. I had the Chiclano and it was just so perfect. It's a pisco drink with ginger liquor and more. I also had a punch which was good too. I would love to come back and try other foods and cocktails

This is the first and last time I ever order from here. I was craving papa a la huancaina and was excited to try it from Pollo d'Oro.

What I got was an absolute insult. There was almost no sauce at all and I paid $12 for this. Why would I pay $12 for a boiled potato? The kitchen should be ashamed for putting this out.

I hope management sees this and speaks with the cooks to correct the preparation so that other people don't waste their money.

Edit: I just found a black wavy hair in the food. DISGUSTING

If you're going to order dinner for a crowd and pizza isn't on the menu for whatever reason, you should give Pollo D'Oro a shot.

They call it Pollo a la Brasa. I don't know why they don't call it Pollo D'Oro, since it's definitely the specialty of the house, but all you need to know is that it's Peruvian rotisserie chicken, perfectly seasoned and available by the quarter, half, or whole. It's a great value.

Get more than you think you need, and make sure you tack on maduros and green sauce. Sure, rice and beans, tostones, and salchipapas are fine accompaniments (the salad is brought down by pale and weak tomatoes out of season), but it's all about that roast chicken. And the maduros. And the green sauce.

After our last order, against all odds I actually have some green sauce left over (I ordered extra). Although its deliciousness demands that I pour it all over whatever it is I eat next and/or rub it into my face in a sensual manner, I plan to put it in my fridge until it goes bad or I forget what it is, whichever happens first.

This is is a completely disrespectful thing to do with such an incredible sauce, but I'm just being honest here.

Because honesty is the best policy.

So I came to this restaurant with a group of 8 and we all enjoyed our time at this spot!

First off the restaurant itself is located on the corner so you get an almost 360 view of your surroundings as it's like a half circle at the corner and squared off. Also there are lovely wide glass windows for you to look out from which came in handy as that day was raining.

So our group made reservations for 6pm on a Sunday evening. Our waitress was friendly and handled our table well and didn't miss a beat. The drinks were on point as well! I tried the Peruvian kiss with its purple color was exactly what I needed. We all ordered various appetizers and main meals. I had the chicken tamales with onion and olives and tasted good! For my main course I had the Tallarines Saltado with shrimp! The shrimp tasted good but I just found the lo mein was a little dry., needed some more sauce with lo main pasta.

All in all I'm glad I tried this Peruvian restaurant!

The lunch grilled chicken sandwich is amazing! I Pair it with sweet plantains and even put it inside my sandwich to give it that sweet and savory taste! I've tried the rotisserie chicken sandwich with cheese but literally it's just bread cheese and chicken... to plain for me! Let's not forget my fave margaritaaaaaaa!!!

The causa rellena is a great appetizer and the empanadas with cheese so yummy!!!

The octopus is the perfect spice and served cold as ceviche with capers .

For dinner I get the chicken saltado! Super delicious !

I have been coming here for the past 2 years with my husband. For starters, we typically order the ceviche and beef empanadas, which is always delicious! My go-to dish is the lomo saltado, you can't go wrong with fries, rice and beef cooked with tomatoes. The food is definitely tasty, but the service could use some improvement. Also, there is a lack of AC during the summer, so it feels like a greenhouse in the restaurant, you will absolutely sweat like crazy! Despite the temperature and need for improvement in terms of service, the food is delicious and I would recommend coming here.

I've been here about 3 or 4 times. I love the food. I went again yesterday and it was empty.. there was literally 1 other person leaving when we got in. I thought they would have been a little more attentive with a group of 3. But okay.

I asked for tea, she brought be tea bags and then like 10 minutes later I had to ask for water and sugar. My boyfriend found a piece of plastic in his food. But I dont know how you're not that careful.. there wasn't any other orders.

I will be back but I expect more from this place.

Great service and good location but extremely overpriced for a very basic Peruvian restaurant. The drinks were great, food was good but not great. Unfortunately, I would not come back and wouldn't really recommend. If you are looking for something around that area, choose somewhere else to get the full experience.

Price- 1 out of 5
Food- 3 out of 5
Service- 5 out of 5
Drinks- 4 out of 5
IG worthy- 2 out of 5

Horrid ripoff.  Price gouging at its worst during this crisis.  Attempted to get drinks for myself and friends but quickly learned that a plastic cup of approx 1 pint of mojito was $52.00?!  So, we walked to the liquor store next door and bought an entire bottle of higher quality alcohol to mix ourselves for the same price, yielding about 20 drinks!  Obscene pricing.  Great food, though!

Tasty Peruvian food. Authentic. A little pricey but worth it since the quality is above average. Took mom here for a pre birthday celebration. Wish I would have tried the chicken. We ordered a jalea, lomo salteado, and salad to share. Everything was so well seasoned cooked perfectly. We were quite impressed. I had a to go order of arroz caufa for my husband. He loved his too. I tried it I love it. Solid establishment I would recommend.

To me a 3 means I got what I expected. Food, service & drink were all OK., But the employees should have better communication  with customers in what's available. They need to work on their service too, Way too slow.

Great chicken no doubt about it.
Just my concern in about the service, Hope they can fix that

I'm a fan! Friend recommended this place as a good neighborhood spot. I ordered delivery from here for the first time -- sidenote, it was literally thunderstorming out -- food came promptly / super quickly (~30min).

Mildly embarrassed reading reviews about the half chicken being perfect for 2 people... Lol. My husband and I got the whole chicken, which comes with 3 sides, as well as an extra side, and finished it ALL. In our defense, we were hungry. Pio Pio is sort of my reference for all Peruvian chicken, and I thought Pollo D'Oro was comparable. Portions were also very generous, which I wasn't expecting (which is why I ordered the whole chicken in the first place). Salchipapas was great. Fried yucca was great. Salad and rice were, well, salad and rice -- they served their purpose. Green sauce was yummy, but probably not THE best green sauce I've had. Overall, very, very satisfying, especially given it's delivery and even more so if it's raining cats and dogs out.

We order from here at least 3-4 times a month and it's consistently good. For two people, the half chicken (which comes with two sides) is the perfect amount of food. We always get the rice and beans and the fried yucca - although, I have had to start ordering an extra side of fried yucca because we always end up fighting over the last pieces!

The chicken is so flavorful and always moist/juicy. It does take a bit of time to prepare so be ready to wait around 15-20 minutes. The empanadas here are also great - we order them when we're in a rush and just need a ""grab and go"" snack.

There's sometimes live music which makes for a lively atmosphere. Hoping to try some other items on the menu but we just can't stop ordering the chicken!

I've eaten at the restaurant many times before and have successfully ordered delivery too... but this is the first time that I cannot believe their delivery service was so poor as was their reaction. I waited over an hour for my food... 30 minutes past the arrival time. I asked the guy what took so long and he said the restaurant sent him to two addresses on opposite sides of town. Worse, the food showed up in a broken bag with the containers smashed, tostones all over the bottom of the bag where the open holes were and it looks like the delivery guy might have shoved the fallen food back in and tied a knot (how unsanitary and scary with Covid!!!). In calling the restaurant just now to have them replace the food -- they basically said refund only because they're too busy to deliver the food that they messed up unless I'm willing to wait yet another hour! So now I'm left hungry and with a really bitter taste in my mouth over this experience and restaurant.

Great! Food was delicious, I ordered the Tallarines Saltado with shrimp, and the portion size was just right! Great flavor and beautiful presentation. The mixed drinks were okay, and I would probably not order again, but I would definitely come back to this cute restaurant again. Parking is fairly difficult to find, though.

This place exceeded my expectations. We came after church on Sunday and were able to walk right in and grab a table. They were serving a brunch menu and both my fianc√©' and I enjoyed our dish. The sweet potatoes were particularly good. I would definitely come back again.

Don't come here u less you have ample time to spend waiting for your food. Came here for lunch and it took us a very long time to order and get our food. That is on down side of this place. On the up side the food is delicious and the portions are generous. The food is fresh and flavorful. Had the ceviche and fried seafood platter and it was absolutely delicious.

This place has been saved on my bookmark for about a year and after taking pictures for a friend we were trying to figure out where to eat around the area. I suggested Pollo D' Oro & I'm glad we did. Everything from the appetizer to the dessert was delicious! For our appetizer we had cheese empanadas w/ a green sauce I think it was aji verde. Whatever sauce it was, it was delicious & I enjoyed it very well with my empanada which was really yummy as well.

For our entrees we both had Peruvian style pasta. I got the Tallarines Saltado ( stir fried Peruvian Lo Mein) and my friend had the Tallarines Verdes (Peruvian style pesto pasta). For dessert we shared a tres leche which was moist and soft. Overall I loved this place and will definitely be coming back to try more food.

I ordered the quarter chicken (with green sauce) and sweet plantains on the evening of 12/17*. It was tasty, however, I woke up with the worst food poisoning the next morning and assume it was from eating the food at this restaurant. 5 stars for flavor but 0 stars for food quality.

This is one of my go-to Peruvian places-- I first came here last year and was delighted by how good it is. Since then, I've kept coming back as a neighbourhood favourite. The prices seem expensive but all their dishes are sharable and is more than enough for a group. Every time I come I try something new and each time I am happy!!!!!!!!! The ambiance is nice, the service is great, love love love. The only thing I would note is that the food can take a bit longer than usual to come so plan for that.

Usually I get a quarter chicken and then try one of their specialties. If you want some ideas for what to order, you can't go wrong with the Lomo Saltado but my personal favourite is the lamb shank. The sauce is UNREAL. Also get all the sides -- you won't leave hungry!

Highly recommended

This is the perfect place to grab dinner in a nice part of Brooklyn that is not inundated with a lot of tourists.

The variety of different pisco sour cocktails were very delicious; my favorite was the Purivian Kiss. Although the drinks are made in a particular manner, out waitresses was very accommodating in modifying my drink requests (as I am not a huge fan of super sweet drinks). The drinks are $12+, but there is a happy hour special until 7PM.

The food was just ok. I had the salmon and shrimp special (I forget what it was called), which was suggested by the waitress because my other option was not available. The salmon was cooked nicely (although it was a bit under-seasoned) but the sauce had a weird texture and it already had that ""pudding skin"" before it was brought to the table. Although the salmon was a bit of a miss, the traditional ceviche made up for it

The picarones were excellent - probably some of the best that I have eaten in NYC. Unfortunately, the sponge cake was not up to par, because it did not have much of a taste and it was really dry.

The servers were very friendly and attentive, although we had to actively flag down a waitress a few times. I cut them some slack, because we visited during a busy Friday night.

I definitely recommend this place is you are in the downtown Brooklyn area and have a craving for Peruvian, but I do not think the the food is that great to travel from multiple boroughs. That said, I could see myself coming back mostly for the bebidas and a quick ceviche.

Great food and great service! Reasonable prices for amazing Peruvian food and the service makes it even better! I got the Jalea, my cousin got the steak meal and we split the steak empanadas. I was sick so I couldn't have any alcohol! The prices here are good, the portions are great and the presentation better. If I wasn't so full I would've gotten dessert! Will have to come back for that! I will definitely come back and bring my boyfriend with me!

I only had appetizers here but it's above the standard Peruvian joint.

We came after a festival and looked like we came from a festival and the staff was accommodating and warm. The food presentation is amazing (creative and colorful) and the good tastes great. Will come back if I'm in the area.

It also felt very safe: Well-distanced tables, mask-wearing by all the staff, and QR code for the menu.

Our party of two visited on a quiet Wed night. We were seated immediately in the outdoor space. We ordered the hummus app and 2 small plates (octopus and burrata), along with splitting a main (the pork chop). The food was all excellent!  The hummus had a nice lemon-y bite, the octopus was a well flavored and composed dish, and the burrata with figs was creamy, slightly sweet and delicious!  One of the best things about this place is the fresh baked bread - so good, we polished off 3 portions w the app and small plates!

The pork chop was so juicy with a delicious and aromatic crust. I would come back to Boutros for this dish alone!

Excellent meal, great service. I'm glad to see a local spot still going strong in these strange times.

A spot that hasn't really drawn me in, but happily went today for call in pick up. Chicken is solid (the garlicky sauce on top was the highlight, but the bulgur fried rice and kale salad were some of the best things I've gotten during Pause. Kale salad comes with all the components split out. Prices are def moderate for the 'hood, too. Glad I went!

One of my favourite spots in Brooklyn-I remember peering in when they were setting up to open a few years ago. Have been a few times over the last 3/4 years and have never been disappointed.

Went the other night, and had an incredible meal outside. The tables are far apart and at the moment they are only offering outdoor dining. We split a load of smaller dishes-fried rice, brussel sprouts, calamari, labneh and burrata. I couldn't tell you which was one was my favourite. It was such a good combination of flavours and freshness.

Cannot recommend enough!

Ordered takeout from Boutros recently and I was blown away by the food! Their pita is AMAZING

Burrata-the figs complemented the cheese well, but I think the pita bread really stole the show. It was so incredibly fluffy, definitely the best pita I've ever eaten in my life

Grilled octopus-the octopus itself was tender but it was a bit too charred. The mashed potatoes were very good but I thought the dollops of what tasted like Frank's hot sauce a bit out of place

Maitake mushroom-the mushrooms were roasted well and I loved the sauce, though I wish the sauce was able to penetrate down to the stems

Braised lamb shoulder-perfectly tender and I liked the pomegranate seed garnish

Happy to support a local business during these weird times.

Boutros is a very cool restaurant on Atlantic, and for our first date night without the puppy since lockdown, we decided to give it a shot!

Small plates were super nice but varied in quality. Pita was fresh out of the oven and blistered to perfection. Burrata was clearly from the fridge and lacked its trademark elasticity. Babaganoush was smooth with miso and was super interesting. Hummus was as expected, hit it with the lemon from the za'atar calamari which would have been a star if delivered to our table hot. The concept of all the dishes was A+.

The roasted half chicken as an entre was phenomenal - kind of like a middle eastern chimichuri. Moist and cut well. Awesome.

Knaffe for desert was prepared to order. Delicate and not too sweet. Very well done. Drinks were poured nicely and drank the same after a stir.

Tables outside were comfortably spaced, people were respectful, service was attentive but not overbearing.

In all, we paid for a very nice experience and a great concept restaurant. Although execution of some small plates this time was off, I look forward to these folks being at full strength. Thanks for a lovely evening! We will be back.

All of the food here is so good! It's a little pricey, but the food is really flavorful and creative. I love ordering the labne, a few skewers, and some of the veggie appetizers. I have also had the steak and chicken entrees and both were delicious. Definitely one of my favorite neighborhood spots!

I was looking forward to having dinner here - I had heard so many good things about it. But perhaps the night I decided to come in - it wasn't to sharp!

We ordered the  hummus as an appetizer and it took forever to get to us only to realize, after our entre came in, that the waitress had forgotten about it (or she misunderstood as she later mentioned). For entres we ordered the fish and the Skewers. My beef skewers (two cubes per skewer - wish it was at least 3) were a bit fatty. My girlfriend's fish was tiny and the base sauce under it was super salty...the price we paid for both meals wasn't on the easy side - I would comfortably say their prices are too high for their food.

The actual interior design of restaurant is exquisite! Has an industrial look with many warm touches - fell in love with the spot - very beautiful and trendy. Great atmosphere!

Downtown Brooklyn's Middle Eastern/ American fusion restaurant. Great location for a marriage of where culture meets food.
Boutros is located next the famous Damascus Bakery and Sahadi gourmet market. The famous Atlantic Ave location is great for walking off such a delicious meal. We shared a lot of appetizers and saved room for dessert.
Worth a second a visit for Brunch. Try to get a seat with a view of the kitchen at the chefs table. Exotic cocktails, wine and beer and don't forget after dinner drink of Lebanese liquor Arak.

Came here for brunch and nervously ordered the Avocado Toast, worried that my $20 would go towards some measly bread crumbs and watered down green mush -- I was delighted to have my worries proved unnecessary!

SUCH GOOD AVO TOAST !!  Each slice was spread with generous amounts of avocado mixed in with the legume/bean-based trimmings.  My favorite part of the dish was the crispy chickpeas!  In general, really impressed with how this savory, vegetarian breakfast option was both refreshing and filling.

My friends ordered Challah French Toast and Shakshuka.  Loved the CFT as a sweet option, and as someone who doesn't usually like sweets, the ricotta and pistachio provided excellent balance against the syrup.  If I were to rank the three dishes, I'd say 1. Avo Toast, 2. CFT, and 3. Shakshuka -- but all were wonderful!

You can see their New American-Middle Eastern fusion in their interior design, earthy industrial with a beautiful mosaic tile floor.  Lots of dark wood, black iron, slate, and moss/lichen.  We spent some time trying to figure out if the roped, light fixtures were solely for aesthetic or were also functional (turns out, also functional - how lovely!)  Not at all busy on a Saturday morning for what a gem of a place this is!

Came here for brunch and had the best meal! They have the absolute cutest decor and the fluffiest pita bread I've ever eaten!

We ordered the burrata cheese dip with fig and fresh baked pita bread which was amazing and then I had the French toast which might be the best French toast I've had.

The staff is nice and it wasn't super crowded but glad to have made reservations. For the two of us with an app, cocktails and an entree each, after tax and tip we paid $100 total.

The food is top notch flavored and that is a big deal because Arabs don't normally expect  to  be blown away at other Arab restaurants because we all prioritize home cooking-- but this place takes the cake! Everything was so perfectly seasoned and cooked. Amazing decor. We loved everything  we got, including all the skewers and the burrata appetizer & the mushroom (which was my favorite).

We only hope that the restaraunt will grow to include more of a Levantine wines selection!

Having spent the morning searching for a new apartment in Brooklyn Heights, we decided to dine at Boutros for brunch and explore the surrounding neighborhood.

The restaurant is modern and well decorated, service is solid, and the vibe is incredibly laid-back.  I'm not sure if this is a Brooklyn-specific thing or whether I've become too comfortable with the idea that people are just rude and that's NYC for ya?!

We ordered the Shakshuka (with poaches eggs, parsley, and house baked pita) and the Halloumi and Spinach Frittata (served with mixed greens and multigrain toast).  For the price point, the portion sizes were generous.  I do regret ordering the Shakshuka for brunch though - way too much pita for one sitting (that's my bad).  It was delicious!  Maybe it's good for sharing?  And absolutely no complaints about that gigantic Frittata!  Yum!

We really enjoyed our meal and look forward to visiting this restaurant again!

Solid, clean Mediterranean food. I ordered duck breast, which comes with some sort of grain, sour cherries and fava. The skin and meat were perfect, really nothing bad to say about the dish at all!

I also tried the pork belly skewer appetizer and beignets for dessert. Both were fine, but not standout. In particular I wish the beignets came with the sauce in a ramekin for easy dipping and were a bit more fluffy.

I topped off the lot with one of their signature cocktails, the ""Thistle & Smoke"" made with Mezcal, Cynar, honey and citrus. It was well-balanced and would make a great summer evening cocktail.

In terms of ambiance I enjoyed the dark wood vibe with industrial touches. The chairs were comfortable. There's a large community table in the center back of the restaurant, so if it's busy you'll probably be knocking elbows with your neighbors. But it was quiet at 9 on a Thursday.

Finally, fantastic service! I was well-taken care of and enjoyed my visit.

Some of the best food I've had in Brooklyn. A bold statement.... but I really can't get over the grilled octopus, the pork belly and the brussel sprouts. Pure heaven.

The pork belly was my favorite dish of the night. Just the right amount of crispiness on the outside, and tender and juicy on the inside. The glaze that formed over it with the hint of grill flavor completely blew me away. The octopus was amazing as well. Not too chewy and unbelievable flavors, plus the potato pur√©e underneath was a really good touch. The brussel sprouts.... some of the best I've ever had, and that's saying a lot with brussel sprouts taking over every menu out there right now. The sauce/glaze was amazing, and the sliced almonds gave it a nice crunch. Also, make sure you get a mezze plate so you can try the pita... you won't be disappointed by either (I recommend the beet hummus)!

The dishes are pretty pricey for the portion size, but they are so spectacular it makes it a little better. The cocktails were really good. Not as strong as I prefer, but very solid flavor combinations. I loved the Thistle & Smoke.

Definitely a good spot for an intimate date night or catching up with a friend.

Boutros has expanded their hours -  Cafe hours Mon-Fri 8am - 3pm and they open again for dinner at 5:30 as previous.
During Cafe hours they serve coffees and delicious house made baked goods and a small lunch-ish menu of pita sandwiches  and skewers
The beef one we had today was cooked to order and delicious.
Highly recommend. Not just for dinner any more :)

Thrillingly good ! That is what we told chef/owner Allan Dabagh after our first meal last night.
Why did we wait so long to come, we asked ourselves.
The food is superb, new American with some interesting accents showing the chefs Lebanese & Syrian roots.
Last nights appetizer special was SO good, it was titled Spring Peas, Hummus, Black Garlic
& Green Almonds. Dani, our very pleasant server, recommended the combination of the Spring Pea salad and the roasted lamb chops with beets and zaatar.  The hummus in the Spring Pea & Snap Pea salad was made with peas, it was unique and outstandingly fresh & delicious.
Everything was on a very high level from the cocktails to the dessert. We will be making many return visits. Chef Allan's commitment to his first restaurant is thorough. He designed the space himself and was working on construction on a daily basis. The room has a really nice feeling that has to be experienced. Also a communal table as well as a handsome bar with a beautiful moss and wood that Allan created himself, lit beautifully and fronted with the wonderful ambers of whisky bottles.
This deserves to be a neighbourhood staple and a destination restaurant for many years to come.

Amazing evening at Boutros. My first time. Great people, great service, fabulous food. The grilled octopus and roasted chicken were out of this world. And don't leave without trying their hot tea... great finish. The owner Allen was personally attentive to all and leads a delightful team.

Atlantic ave has come a long way since the late 90s. Boutros fits in nicely with a Mediterranean/Middle Eastern/New American mix and a strong chef that pairs quality ingredients and excellent flavors with stylized presentation.

The design of the restaurant is gorgeous and inviting. Generous amount of single strung Edison bulbs hang from the ceiling and give off a gentle hue that feels intimate. I do wish the sound levels were better attenuated as it can get loud and a bit hard to hear without yelling slightly. I also would have preferred a more comfortable chair and a place to hang a coat (since the chair design doesn't allow it to be hung across the back effectively). Do yourself a favor and get creative with a custom off-menu drink. They have some housemade sodas that beg for a kick. We had a pineapple punch with rum and Ginger lemonade with vodka.

But don't let some of these minor flaws obfuscate the great cuisine. We started with some mezze of Lennard crostini which was just the right amount for 4 and had a wonderful texture and flavors. Following up as apps we went for the kale tabouleh salad, mozzarella pizza and bulgur fried rice. Skip the pizza but must get bulgur & kale (PRO TIP: Mix the rice & kale for a treat).

I opted for the fish which was a perfectly cooked halibut on a light bed of bok choy in a light sauce (which also works with the bulgur fried rice). My wife ordered the steak that came out exactly medium rare with a nice char on the outside.

We didn't have room for dessert but felt that our whole meal was excellent. Service was solid, if a little inefficient (didn't take multiple refill drink orders when one of us ordered). Water was constantly filled and a well appointed bathroom make for a fine dining experience. We'll be coming back for sure. Also noticed they're on Seamless now too!

Quintessential Lebanese restaurant! Exceptional food, wonderful space and friendly service. It's clearly a neighborhood go-to. When you walk in the space is warm and inviting and it seems as though everyone knows each other. The first few minutes you feel like an outsider and then the staff puts you at east and starts treating you like a regular.

Chef Allen Dabagh displays the welcoming demeanor that the Lebanese are known for. Clearly, he's never met a stranger. It seems all the guests in the restaurant on Wednesday night were his friends or family. And the food! Oh, the food!

Sitting at the chef's counter was like being in my grandmother's kitchen - if my grandmother had attended the French Culinary Institute. Mezze is my favorite way to eat. Small plates, spread over time. Different textures, flavors, and temperatures - it's food for my ADHD brain! The menu starts with traditional Lebanese foundations: hummus, skewers, halloumi labneh, tahini, and then brings different modifiers (e.g. peas or beets in the hummus) and spices (sumac, dukkah, za'atar) blending them in creative ways. The results are lively and delicious. New twists on ancient food.

My only regret is that Allen was not serving Kibbeh Nayeh the night we went. His take on Lebanese steak tartare includes bulgur, puffed amaranth, sunflower seeds, and spring onion! And it's served with homemade pita hot from the oven. Sounds like heaven!

Ah Boutros... Saturday night dinner with my mate. My first impression is the restaurant was warm and inviting- nice ambiance. But...

They sat us under a speaker and proceeded to blast 90's soft-core, gangsta rap, heavy on the bass, for the duration of our meal. I mean, come'on... none of you listened to 90's gangsta rap back in the actual 90's back when I would've appreciated a deep bass line. I'm old now, so all that bass was annoying to me all night long. But I guess it's fair... I annoyed plenty of people with the same music back in the 90's...

Anywho... the annoying music aside, I had a really special chicken entree here. I mean it was absolutely delicious and memorable in every way. The rest of our food was tasty (including a sorta sweet pork dish), but not as memorable.

All-in-all, I'd say what I most remember about that night was the bass of the music, the amazing chicken dish, and paying way too much for other, less memorable, dishes.

But opinions vary. You might still wanna try this one if you're in the neighborhood.

Really beautiful, cozy restaurant. Love the ambience of this place. The food is pretty delicious as well. We ordered a mozzarella and tomato pizza to share as a starter. It was very good and more than we could finish. For mains, I ordered the duck with freekeh, fava bean, sour cherry and coffee. Wow, this dish was really amazing! The duck was so tender and juicy and all of the elements of the dish worked really well together, despite the oddness of their combination. Portion wasn't huge, but it was enough for me.

The only quibble I have with this place is due to a slight misunderstanding. During our starter, we decided to eat only half the pizza and take back the rest to save room for the entrees. We were kept waiting quite a long time, until we finally had to ask the server where our entrees were. Turns out that he had been waiting for us to finish the pizza before bringing them out. My preference is usually to have the server check up on us at some point, but I suppose flagging him down would have been appropriate this time. It happens, I guess.

This review is for bunch only. Strangely, they opened thirty minutes after the opening time listed on Google or Yelp...it seemed like they weren't quite ready for customers (who were already gathering and waiting outside the door), which was a bit odd. When they did finally open the doors, we really enjoyed ourselves, though.

Fun music, gorgeous space, and delicious food. Absolute BEST thing we tried was the avocado toast. One of the best I've had. Avocado mixed with tahini and served with a runny egg and crisped chickpeas. We also liked the shakshuka. The halloumi scramble was less exciting but the potatoes served with it were outstanding - so crispy and awesome. Prices are steep but I will definitely be back to try dinner some time!!

My review right now won't do justice. This place has amazing food. Like, beyond next level of contemporary heaven on a plate type of quality. I will say this....BEST octopus I've ever had. Period. And a nice portion size which is rare with octopus. The edemame humus also a nice touch. Since it was our anniversary(good date spot for sure), they have us a free puff pasty dessert. It was equally insane goodness. I will definitely update my review as I remember AND go back to try everything. One of the best places to eat in the area for sure. Well done.

One thing I'll never complain about is the explosion of new trendy and upscale restaurants opening up in the neighborhood. I'd been following Boutros' Instagram for a while (since before they opened) and finally made my way there for dinner.

The space is as gorgeous as advertised. It wasn't a restaurant before, which is even more impressive. The bartender told us it was actually an ice cream shop decades ago, and they kept the floor tiling. There are cool lightbulbs hanging from strings, and tons of awesome cooking/cocktail books lining the shelves. There's also a big mossy thing on the wall behind the bar and in the bathroom.

Anyway, the entrees range from $18 to $31, but I recommend doing a bunch of starters to share and a pizza if you're just 2-3 people.

We did the foie gras fritters, grilled octopus, smoked halloumi, and the clam pizza.

You'd think deep frying foie gras wouldn't work, but it does. I especially loved the strawberry sauce that it was set on top of.

The octopus was cooked perfectly - tender and not at all rubbery. Could've gone for a little more char though. The red pepper chutney was a great complement.

The grilled halloumi was basically a sizable arugula salad with watermelon. The halloumi was hidden underneath and the whole dish was a nice contrast of flavors.

The clam pizza was pretty damn good as well. The crust was airy, and the clams were plentiful. It's not quite a New Haven crust, but it's probably one of the better clam pizzas in the area (which is no small feat since there are a TON of pizzerias nearby).

Their beer selection was respectable, and they have a hell of a wine list. Service was great, and I'm looking forward to coming back for brunch!

Having recently attended an amazing Yelp Elite event at the restaurant,  I booked a brunch for me and a friend this past weekend.

My friend enjoyed her Shakshuka, and I thoroughly enjoyed my avocado toast with poached egg.  The egg is not really necessary though (an upsell item at $3 extra), as the dish with its fried garbanzo and stewed fava beans, provide plenty of protein.  Unless you really love beautifully poached eggs.  The dishes are nothing fancy, just very tasty, filling, and comforting.  The coffee was delish as well.

Service was pleasant as well - one of the standout elements of this place.  Definitely merits a return visit in the near future.

I vowed to come back for this foi gras fritters and I did just that. It was amazing. I think my favorite dish is the mushroom dish, and the octopus. I can't get that sweet tahini out of my mind. I also had the duck again, and I tried the beef and broccoli dish that was amazing. The beef was very tender. The broccoli and sauce was spicy and sweet at the same time.  We were treated to a new dessert on the menu a halvah chocolate / ice cream dish, that was truly delicious. I am more of a light dessert kinda gal, (but I love halvah) but for those must have chocolate after dinner types, a great choice.

The service was impeccable. Nobody rushed us. We sat and sipped hibiscus tea afterwards and a great time was had.

I likey!

We started with cocktails, I had the ginger which was very acidic, and gingery, and very strong just the way I like it. The Labneh crostini, was very tasty. A bit thicker than the typical crostini, I think it was served on focaccia bread, but it lended well to the tart flavors of the labneh. We wanted to order the fois gras fritters, but unfortunately they were out of it (and the pea dish).

The bulgar rice was really extraordinary. I rarely eat grains at restaurants. If I'd work nearby I'd buy just the rice for lunch.

The duck was delicious . The cook was on point, and I really enjoyed the cherry sauce.

I hate to admit that the pork was a little bit disappointing. It was a bit dry, and just not as special as I was expecting from the restaurant. Every dish we had was shared, and after we each had a bite, we sent it back, but paid for it. :/ I'm not always sure what to expect when the dish isn't up to par, but whatevs.

The mushroom dish was aaaamazing! I love love that sweet tahini sauce that I stole a potato from the pork dish and swiped some of that tahini.

The strawberry knafeh was refreshing and interesting. It was a great end to a great meal.

I will certainly dine there again. Please have some fois gras fritters and peas waiting.

Wow! What a gem this place is. The interior is very modern and welcoming. The staff is genuine and friendly. You get a feeling of being at somebody's home as opposed to just any restaurant yet in a modern setting. I absolutely love this place. And the food...oh the food. You're in a mood for something interesting? Possibly tasting history and influence of different countries? Then this is the place. Their cocktails are also very unique. Definitely check this place out. It's one of a kind

It's fitting that Chef Allen Dabagh opened his first restaurant on this stretch of Atlantic. The Middle Eastern flavors from his heritage blended with New American cookery is a perfect representation of the amazing (if bougie) neighborhoods of Cobble Hill and Brooklyn Heights, bisected by a street that gives us Sahadi's, Damascus Bakery and more.

The space itself is beautiful. From the living wall behind the bar, to the chef's counter where you can watch the efficient expediting of everything you're about to eat, there isn't a bad seat in the house.

The menu is divided into appetizers, vegetables, pizzas, and mains. I've yet to try the pizza (although the crust looked superb as one walked by, and the za'atar sprinkled bread they bake fresh for each table speaks to the quality of that 760 degree oven), but every other section sports at least a few winners.

Among the starters, the fluke crudo had heat and balance, in addition to being easy on the eyes. The foie gras fritters are foie gras fritters (can't be bad), and although I would've liked a bit more of the soujouk (think Middle Eastern chorizo), the bulgur fried rice was tasty as well. That last dish seems out of place as a starter; it's a large portion and it doesn't feel like an appetizer. With more soujouk added and a fried egg on top (as opposed to scrambled and mixed in as it is) it would make it a perfect dish to start your day (I believe it's on the menu of their recently launched brunch, so there's that). In fact, since we ordered too much, I took it home and did just that, and it was phenomenal.

The mains are well-cooked, well-balanced, and tied together by incredible sauce work. The brown sauce with the beef is something I could just drink as my meal, and the caramel that comes with the pork chop ties the entire dish together. I appreciate the way the flavors are layered as well; the perfectly tender beef arrives with both charred stalks of broccoli, and also a broccoli puree. The effect is stunning, and it's my favorite dish thus far.

Similarly (and shockingly), the peas were the most memorable aspect of our most recent meal. With charred whole peas, pea pods, and a puree on the sides, it all came together with the green almonds added in a final flourish, and it made me so happy that it (1) tasted amazing and (2) shows that vegetables aren't an afterthought at all.

All in all, an excellent addition to the neighborhood, and I plan to keep coming back.

Came before seeing a movie around the corner. The first thing that struck me was the cocktail list. I literally couldn't decide because they all looked fantastic. Ordered the 'Bitter Tree' and it was fantastic!

My wife and I opted to order an assortment of small plates, and each was delicious. We got the miso baba, the grilled octopus, the bulger fried rice, roasted cauliflower and 2 skewers (pork belly and chicken). Everything was wonderful, and it was the perfect amount of food for us.

Very recommend!

Jordan the bartender is reason to come here alone! The drinks are very good however they're pretty expensive... But the ambience is really really cool. I love the living wall that you can just stare at for hours while just having a drink. I came here on a Thursday evening and was very well attended to, and very well taken care of, even though I was only ordering drinks and didn't get anything to eat. The people next to me ordered flatbread pizza, and it looked so good! I wish I would've ordered dinner. When I come back to Brooklyn Heights, I will for sure order something off of their food menu. This place is quiet enough to have a conversation, but lively enough that you don't get bored. It would be good for any kind of mixed drinks, cocktails, beer, or wine.

I wasn't able to score a spot to the yelp elite event here a few months back, but the pictures looked so good I knew I had to make it out here.
Boutros is definitely a special occasion kind of place both in price and atmosphere. The service is very attentive and the staff is very knowledgeable about the food and drink.
With regards to the food it was interesting, in a good way. The night started off with a Mezcal mixed drink. A bit oaky and citrusy, this hit the spot. The Zaatar house made roll was amazing but I would have appreciated one per person instead of just one to split. I could have had at least three just by myself.
We started off with the fois gras fritters and this was really the only miss of the night. The fritters were perfectly fried but liquid on the inside. I've never had fois gras in liquid form and it was just a weird texture for me. Another appetizer the squash baba ganoush was excellent. Perfectly spiced it was a great vegetarian treat.
For my main dish I ordered the pork chop and it was the best pork chop I have ever had! Grilled to perfection it was juicy and flavorful. The fingerling potatoes and grilled pears complemented it perfectly.
The hubby had the ravioli with Lardo. I liked his dish because I have a sweet spot for lardo or anything like it, but my pork chop was still my favorite of the two.

For dessert we had the halva chocolate bar. Good but a bit forgettable.

Overall we had a really nice time. The ambiance was trendy in a laid back way and the lighting is perfect for a date or a get together with friends.

Came here for dinner and it happened to be happy hour. Cocktails were 9$. I got 2 ginger gimlets and they were delicious and visually appealing. My bf and I split the half chicken and the bulgur fried rice. Both were absolutely divine. The food is clearly great quality and full of flavor. Worth the $$$. For dessert we shared the grape and strawberry sorbet. Again, very delicious, and a great dessert to clear the palate. We will definitely come again. I am looking forward to trying their brunch.

We dropped in to Boutros one night for dinner and drinks, and we are so happy we did! We sat at the bar and ordered cocktails, small plates, and skewers to share. The ambiance, service, drinks and food were all excellent. The grilled octopus was particularly good. The bartenders were friendly and you can really tell when the staff is passionate and proud of the product they are putting out.

Our only regret was not sitting at the ""chefs table"" style seating in the back, which we didn't notice right away.

I had had one of those days, that happens once in a decade: EVERYTHING went pear shaped, capped by a spectacular wipeout on a slippery sidewalk grate.
I decided I deserved a drink. So stopped in a lovely little restaurant in my neighborhood.
The bartender was wonderful, the cocktail was lovely. I looked a wee bit bedraggled... not my normal, glammed up self: wasn't filming my show that night. The nice hostess was eying me a wee bit askance, but I kept texting with Courtney Love and perusing the menu.
Ordered a drink, then decided to have something with ""nestle sauce"". Now, usually stinging plants are t my thing, but I figured ""well, must be safe"" and went ahead.
Took a few bites while absentmindedly texting away.. then realized PAIN OUCH TONGUE OUCH NOOOO!

Nettles are not your friend. Unless they've been boiled for at least five minutes. Felt like razor blades. NOT FUN.

The owner came over, and took the accusatory stance that people who open restaurants but haven't brushed up on customer service, do. ""We served 40 people thisfish today, and nobody else complained! said Mr. Owner.
Well, bully for those fifty folks. My mouth and throat hurt like fiddledeedee.

Asked how they were cooked.
He mimed lowering nettles into boiling water (not great at customer service, but epic at mime), and taking them out again.
""The chef blanches them"", he said impatiently.
Ahhh! As someone with UK roots, I have cooked nettles. They MUST be boiled. For five minutes plus. I mentioned this. Unsurprisingly, I was again oooh poohed. I shut my silly female mouth, and they comped the nettles.
Not my drinks, which, while not necessary, would have made me less grumpy.

So.. 28 bucks for two small cocktails,
One sore mouth and throat. 10 minutes being scolded.

What a FAAABULOUS experience!
Not.

Lots of other good (and much cheaper!!) restaurants in the neighborhood.

UPDATE: The owner answered below, and demonstrates yet again his amazing flair for customer relations. Calling me a liar, saying I used ""Yelp"" as a threat, and using my politeness against me.. what a great way to handle this! How gracious and kind.
The customer is not only always wrong here- the customer is a liar.
Maybe that explains all your other one and two star reviews? Perhaps only crazy liars eat here.
Not to worry: the words ""not twice"", apply.

Well played, you.

UPDATE: Once again, the owner is playing ""Blame The Customer"". You just don't get it, do you. Calling me names, insulting me, implying I'm a liar: I still paid 28 bucks, to have my throat and mouth hurt, due to your negligence.
I was bullied by you, so I was more polite than I felt, so I could leave fast. You have an arrogant and threatening presence. As your rude and arrogant response, below, proves.
If you are going to call me a liar, what about all the other one and two star reviews here? Are they all liars?
Next time I will it's go to the ER and sue you. That's what I should have done earlier.
As for my going to Yelp? You have a restaurant that charges money for an experience. I had a shitty experience at your restaurant. Deal with it, rather than insulting me.
If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.
If you want to apologize,I'm here. But you don't apologize, do you?

Interesting decor. They like moss.

Lebneh appetizer was good. The bread was great, the lebneh was nice and tart, the seeds and veg they put on there added a nice texture.

The ginger cocktail is really good. The red citrus cocktail was middling. The caramelized pineapple cocktail, which I had high hopes for, tasted reminiscent (and somewhat resembled) dip spit. Y'all should really fix that.

The halloumi in the hash and the raclette on the nduja sandwich were hardly discernible, which is a shame because I love halloumi. I didn't really get the flavor or texture from it at all. The nduja sandwich was pretty decent. The avocado and fried chick pea toast was really good, but I feel like it's hard to mess up avocado toast.

Service was prompt and friendly.

We were a party of 4 seated immediately. We shared the Dipping Plate (comes with the house flatbread), and I had the fried brussel sprouts and the fried halloumi cheese & artichoke heart salad (vegetarian). The salad had the perfect amount of dressing and I'm not usually a fan of raw mushrooms but these were alright. The fried brussel sprouts were amazing (make sure you mix it up cause there's some yummy honey vinegar that collects at the bottom). The house flatbread was delicious with the za'atar seasoning and most of the dips (tahini and tzatziki) were delicious too. The butternut squash dip didn't have much flavor but the tatbelah (green dip) was a kick of garlicky-tangy flavor to the mouth...maybe a bit too much.

The timing of the dishes was weird. They take a while to prepare the food so be patient. The waiter told us he'd bring the dipping plate out first but we ended getting the main dishes for 3 of our party first. Unfortunate because the 4th person without food was my partner and he felt it was totally justified to mooch off my plates. Then we got the dipping plate and I was able to distract him with that. But then he was back to stealing my food until finally his dish came (and not a moment too soon!).

Heard this place is bopping for brunch so I'll be trying that next!

COVID times assessment: Menu by QR code, hand sanitizer at your table, and plenty of space between tables. Even though we were seated at the sidewalk, the outdoor seating is on a side street (not on the much busier 5th ave) so it feels roomy. They had a live band playing on the sidewalk too (at least when we went on Thursday)!

That line in the front even during Covid times... yea it's for a reason. I went for brunch and tried the green and ""regular"" shakshuka. Both were delicious but I prefer the sweeter taste of red Shashuka - the green tomatoes (maybe season) lacked flavor to me.

I had a really solid dinner at Miriam. It closes at 9pm on Saturday nights, and I had placed an order for pickup because I wasn't going to be able to get there until a few minutes after 9. When I arrived, I saw that they have a lovely outdoor seating setup and asked if I could stay to eat, which they allowed. Our food had already been packaged up in to go containers, so it was low maintenance on their part. The brussel sprouts were amazing and I'm sure that they would have been even better had we had them closer to when they were cooked. The babaganoush was also very good. The hummus was decent, but had a little too much liquid sitting on the top. Unfortunately, we had ordered the flatbread but they were out of it so they gave us some pita instead which was tasty.

Miriam was very serious about COVID precautions and every waiter was wearing their masks correctly. The tables were adequately spaced out.

Overall, it was a really cute vibe and I hope to come back and actually have the full dine in experience here!

Miriam does simple food well and they run a tight brunch ship. If you, like me, think brunch is lame and want something a little more substantive or inspiring other than eggs and buttered starch for breakfast, you'll be pleased to know that Miriam does offer some real food during weekend lunch hours, like soups, salads, sandwiches, and schnitzels. I got the yellow split pea soup, which was the soup of the day, and the Greek salad that had feta and wrapped grape leaves. The split pea soup was smoky and savory in all the right ways and now I want that recipe!

They have a lot of different types of seating, and some spots have heat lamps. Come before 11 since the lines get crazy otherwise.

I had been here once many years ago and wasn't particularly impressed and my friends have also had mixed experiences. This time I enjoyed the food and the music but service was slow and not as attentive as we would have liked.
The eggs florentine was good but needed salt and the salad was barely dressed. I did like that there was a lot of lettuce though!
The sabich was better than I expected and I was happy the eggs could be poached and not just hardboiled. The eggplant was perfectly cooked and not too greasy. The pickles were crunchy and flavorful and the hummus a lovely smooth mixture. I especially enjoyed the green tahini dipping and that the server offered us more pita(unsure if we were charged because service was slow and I had to run out!)
The first table we sat at had not been sanitized yet so we had to switch but when we came back the table was still dirty and there were pickles on the floor.
We sat under the speaker purposely and enjoyed the soul and motown tunes.
There were some delays in getting water, the meal took close to 20 minutes and we got utensils after the food came.
My friend had been the week prior and said service was super fast so I will give it another try.
We sat on the sidewalk but they also had the street seating.

I came here excited for Israeli food. Upon arriving, I waited 20 minutes in line for a seat without a host or anyone to let us know/guide us about our ETA and how seating works. We eventually sat down and ordered, and I hoped that the food would be worth it after reading the reviews. The shakshuka was average and the portion was very small for the price tag of $18. Two of my friends ordered omelettes - the server messed up the order (they had asked for no potatoes due to strict dietary restrictions and still were served potatoes instead of salad). The side of Israeli salad was also the size of a sampler. Overall, the food itself was very subpar and expensive. They have outdoor dining, but it will take a while to get a seat. Not worth it, and definitely not true Israeli food or hospitality.

I love this place. It's been around forever! I loved coming here when I lived in BK and recently gathered friends for some holiday shopping. It's authentic, welcoming, and delicious but you need to put in your name and come back in an hour (if you are lucky).

We snagged some seats at bar after 30min.  We still had another 40mins to go for a table.

We toasted with Bellinis and hard ginger kombucha (tasted like a cider & similar alcohol content). We opted for classic shakshuka, mushroom omelette, and Israel breakfast. We were all happy with our choices.

It's worth a visit if you are in neighborhood but have a plan so you aren't surprised by the wait.

Came from brunch on a Saturday at noon and was quoted a 45 minute wait. The weather was nice, so the wait wasn't bad. I noticed that this place does clear up a lot around 1pm (brunch lasts still 4pm).

I had the Norwegian eggs while my friends had the chicken schnitzel and the chicken Schwarma. We shared a side of hummus and fried eggplant. While the eggs I had were good, I couldn't get over how below average the hummus was. It just didn't taste fresh at all.

I also had some really burnt potatoes for my dish. There was another person in my party that also ordered the Norwegian eggs and her potatoes were burnt as well.

I would come back and try the rest of the menu but would definitely not get the hummus again because I don't want to be disappointed

Great food with limited but very authentic dishes. The right place for egg lovers. I was in a mood of kabobs, so order chicken sheekh kabobs, which was delicious and very nicely marinated with the Mediterranean spices. We also enjoyed green sauce and mango chatni sauce with hummus. Chicken kabobs served on the flatbread with the layer if spinach (could be more cooked or softer) and yogurt sauce. We asked for some hot sauce which was yummy and fresh. Another dish was served with an excellent presentation in a round bowl called Sabeh platter was good too, and basically, it's a vegetable dish.
The service was excellent, and we loved the outdoor seating. Price was a bit high but still worth trying, and we will recommend this place with family and friends.

Have been wanting to try this place forever. I eventually decided to order for delivery during covid and was not disappointed at all. Looks like they now have a lot of outdoor seating so I'm excited to check it out for dine in. Everything came on time, correct order and kept well during delivery. It's clear this is a step up from the tons of Mediterranean take out places nearby. The ingredients were top notch. I went with the chicken shawarma and the Brussels sprouts, which were amazing with their chili glaze. My girlfriend went with the braised short rib which was extremely tender and very flavorful. Will be back again for sure.

Miriam is a very cute place, but the food wasn't something I'd rave about. I went for brunch and got the Eggs Florentine. The hollandaise sauce was not tasty and the food overall was bland. However, the service was very good and the ambience was great.

Okay, AMAZING!! This food was just amazing. Go here!!

We got the:

Israeli Breakfast
two eggs (any style) with Labneh cheese, home fries, Israeli salad & pita

Burekas
puffed pastry pocket stuffed with feta & olives, served with two eggs (any style), Labneh cheese, Israeli salad & tahini sauce

I was a little worried because I don't love olives but the Burekas seems like it would be amazing. The olive flavor was very tame. The pastry was soft, moist.. just wonderful.

The portions are really good sized for the cost, and it was just so good!!

My star rating:
5  - you have to go!!!
4 - you won't be disappointed
3  - it was okay
2  - I probably won't go back
1  - turnaround and run

This place is AMAZING. I rarely venture out to Brooklyn but I would definitely make the trip just for this place.

I got the Mediterranean Cripsy Dough for brunch and omg am I glad I did. The crispy dough was perfect. The eggs were delicious and well seasoned but not overly so. The sauces on the side were different but not unpleasant. I especially enjoyed the red/pinkish one which was a fresh Tomatoe base but mixed with some other kind of ingredient.

This place gets crowded so definitely make a reservation! Service is a little slow.

I had mixed feeling about Miriam. We ordered from them once and we were blown away by their food. The Chicken Shwarma dish was absolutely wonderful! A little bit on the pricer side, we decided to visit it during brunch the following weekend. A little bit disappointed by their overall food. We ordered the Omlete croissant sandwich and I couldn't finish it because it was so bland and dry. I would probably still try it since - it was during covid times and a lot of places have changed their chefs.

Pretty pricey for a vegetarian brunch, but so intricately delicious and delightful that I was happy to pay $18 for 2 scrambled eggs, an Israeli bagel, a few pickles, tomato slices, and avocado... Generally I have a pretty big appetite, especially at brunch after a night of drinking, so I didn't expect to be full after eating such a delicate meal... to my surprise, I was so satisfied after savoring each bite that I didn't need to become ""full"" and finish my eggs or the bagel... Thanks for being so good you saved me from overeating, Miriam! See you again soon :)

My friend and I came here for brunch a few weeks ago. We got there around 1:30pm on a Sunday and were able to get a table for 2 outside (without a wait) to enjoy the good weather.

We shared a side of the potato pancake and it was so good. (Might get one for myself next time!) We also both got the Norwegian eggs Benedict, which sounded especially appealing because it was served on zucchini cake. The salmon was fresh and I enjoyed it a lot with the zucchini cake. Definitely coming back!

I had a long wait which is understandable given the times. I thought about going somewhere else, but I am glad to have stayed for brunch. I had the Norwegian eggs and thoroughly enjoyed them. My girlfriend had potato pancakes which also were great. I look forward to coming back soon and trying more dishes.

My Wife and I came here for a early dinner. The ONLY thing on the menu that was tasteful was the Raspberry Lemonade.  My wife had the Fish, flavorless even the mashed potatoes needed season. I order the Lamb, rice was undercooked and instead of Lamb the gave me chopped steak. NEVER EVER AGAIN. I WISH I COULD GIVE THIS PLACE HALF A STAR

I've walked passed Miriam many times but never stopped inside. A bunch of my friends decided to have brunch here on a Sunday and we were told by the host that it would be about a 15 minute wait. Well, half an hour later, we were still waiting to be called and seated, even when there were multiple empty tables inside. We had to wait outside because the restaurant is narrow and there is no space to stand inside.

When we finally got seated, we had a very nice waitress. I had the shakshuka, which I was underwhelmed by. It just tasted like salsa from a can. I much prefer the shakshuka from Nish Nush, which has more flavor and a kick to it. I was disappointed. I will say I liked the hummus though. Sad to say, I don't think I'll be returning here.

2/8/2020Hi April,
Thank you for visiting us and your review. I was sorry to hear of your experience. We do our best to seat guests ASAP as it is in everyones interest. Sometimes it is very difficult to gage turnover.
Many of our guests complain that they see empty tables when they are asked to wait which is understandable. We employ a wait list that enables us to text guests on that list and many do not stay at Miriam's. We allow for a 10m window for them to respond or show up and then move to the next guest if they don't show up. In the interim tables can be empty.
Both our Shakshuka's are best seller's and we don't tend to get complaints about them. They are both made with fresh ingredients, on the spot and can be spiked with our homemade Harrisa. I hope we get another opportunity to host you at Miriam's.
Dan

The food arrived on time and was either cold or frozen. None of the dishes matched the photos of ""Miriam at home"". The 4 oz fish portion had no additional vegetables, the 6 oz short rib ragu came without polenta/mashed potatoes, the 7 1/2 oz rice came without any herbs or spices on top. No sides were included as shown in photos on line. The babaganoush and bread were as expected. The meal had to be heated. This was a very disappointing experience. We feel that we were mislead on almost every item! This this restaurant usually is much better and a delightful place to eat but not recommended now.

Yum!

I've wanted to come to Miriam for a while and finally came here for Sunday brunch.
This place is great and the food is delicious!

Its a Mediterranean spot but they also have brunch classics like eggs Benedict (and Florentine and Norwegian)

I always crave Israeli food and honestly, I would order everything from the menu. Everything sounds mouth watering to me and there is no doubt I would come back and even order a delivery.

We got the fired dough (also known as malawach) its basically a puff pastry pancake, on the denser side. Its a little bit sweet and it comes with grated tomatoes, harissa/ schug hot pepper paste/sauce, and eggs. Traditionally you eat it with a hard boiled egg but we decided to go for over easy.
It was really good! I would recommend this dish!

We also got the burekas breakfast. Comes with eggs any style, Israeli salad and labane with za'athar and olive oil. The burekas is a puff pastry - super fluffy and delicious. This one was with cheese filling. The labane was really good too. Highly recommend this

Also decided to get a side of falafel which was sooo good and a potato pancake which was just okay. Honestly the breakfast was very filling on it's own, but I had to try the falafel

I would definitely come for lunch/ dinner as well!

Staff was attentive and quick!

Don't walk, run! Loved this place

Excellent flavorsome and filling brunch!! I got the Burekas ($17, a bit pricey but I guess that's NY for you) which was served on a big plate and included scrambled eggs (cooked perfectly), a tomato-cucumber salad, (not sure if it's Israeli) yogurt with good-quality olive oil + dried spices, a green tahini sauce (mild and fresh-tasting) and of course those flakey olive-feta filled pastries! I haven't had Israeli food before this but I could tell the meal was prepared with quality ingredients. Everything tasted freshly made and I greatly enjoyed the textures and flavors on my plate.

Came as a party of two on a Saturday around 10:30AM and it took a bit for us to get seated even though there were plenty of open tables indoors. It was actually quite dark inside so we chose to sit by the open windows. My friend got their fried crispy dough, which for the same price was surprisingly minimal-- two sauces and two poached organic eggs on top of the thinly stretched out dough. I got to try a piece of the fried dough and it was surprisingly savory (not just flavorless bread)! I don't think our waitresses were very attentive to us after serving the food. I found a thin thread of white string in my tomato-cucumber salad but left it on a napkin and continued eating.

We also ordered a side of pancakes (which only comes with a pad of butter and maple syrup) + paid extra for fresh berries (raspberry, blackberry, blueberry) but this was a BIG DOWNER. Took the pancakes to-go as we were in a rush to leave and ate them the next day. Wow, are these pancakes very lackluster. First, they were dry (didn't look special when they were originally served) and super overpriced. $5 for one small pancake that tasted like it was made out of a box and what's worse is that the tiny handful of berries we got cost us $7. $7 for NOT FRESH berries that had mold on one raspberry. Unfortunately we didn't have the chance to complain about this as we were just visiting NY for the weekend.

We came for brunch and ended up waiting close to an hour. They said it would be 30 min, when we got the text to come back. When we arrived exactly 2 minutes after getting the text, they didn't have a table for us. We said we would wait longer if we could get a table outside, which the waitress promised, but we ended up being crammed into a corner spot inside. The food was fresh and flavorful.

Overall: 4/5. Good food, mediocre service.

Miriam is easily one of the top brunch spots in park slope. All the food I have had is great. My favorites are definitely the boreka breakfast and the schnitzel sandwich. The boreka breakfast really has a nice balance of everything you would want in an Israeli breakfast while the schnitzel is cooked to perfection. One thing to note is if it are having an espresso based coffee drink, get it in early- I think they have only one machine so it can take a little while to get your coffee.

Also, they don't take brunch reservations so make sure to show up early as you probably will wait 15-30 mins depending on your group size. I would not come here with more than 4 people if possible. I have not come here for dinner yet but wave to try it at some point. All I know is their brunch is definitely worth the visit

Adorable Spot in Park Slope. Sit outside if it's a sunny day as the trees and flowers give it an amazing feel.

You can tell a place is good by their hummus which I thought was solid here. We had gotten Shashuka and Chicken Schnitzel Sandwich (why I chose this when there are so many other options is beyond me. I wanted something fried). Both were tasty. The bread was a little tough on the sandwich but that presentation is unbeatable. Service was a little slow- 40 min to get our food. But I do sympathize as there were quite a few patrons on the sunny day.

Overall a very solid choice for Park Slope area. It's a little pricey for what it delivers but again, welcome to Park Slope.

Came her on a Friday night because were in the area. The food was great! I got Mediterranean seafood dish and it was great! My love got the lamb shawarma and it was ok. I loved the ambiance and I think this is a really nice place to have a date night or a girls night. It was quiet enough to talk and have a conversation. Service was great! Food was great! Loved it!

I've been to Miriam several times at it offers a taste of Israel here in Brooklyn. I've been to Israel as have most people in my life, and this is where we've come to scratch our Mediterranean itch.

In general, Miriam has good offerings, but I've noticed quality slip a bit since beginning to come. My experience last night was underwhelming in particular. It was pretty clear that the cauliflower, hummus, flatbread with Za'atar, and pita had been sitting out far too long prior to being served, though the flavors were as expected. The oil had settled on the bottom of the cauliflower, and the flatbread was an unfortunately lukewarm cracker by the time it got to us. The lamb shawarma that we ordered to split was served hot and was good, but lukewarm pita detracted from the experience. Service was attentive and the outdoor seating was a nice local, but the food should star here.

I'm hoping this experience isn't a sign of true decline, because I've been recommending this place for years to friends and family. I hope that my next visit will prove to be a bit more hot from the kitchen.

Good food, terrible delivery. ALWAYS. Just had to cancel an order that was nearing 2 hours late. When I said that I wanted to cancel, here are two words I didn't hear: I'm sorry. If the food is late and the staff is apathetic, then it's me who's sorry because I'm out.

Miriam is my favorite brunch spot in Park Slope. I am sure others agree too as it is always packed, and wait to be seated.
But, once you are seated service is great and food is delicious.
I ordered Blueberry Pancakes, a side of Home Fries and freshly squeezed Orange Juice. Our table had also other orders such as Red Shakshuka, and 2 Eggs. Everything we ordered was very delicious and absolutely worth the wait. Food was 10/10.
It is a little noisy but not too crazy.
Service was great.

My husband and I came to Miriam today for brunch. The food was not only very tasty but also had a very good flavor to it. Their Jerusalem bagel was really tasty with the scrambled eggs that I had. I also had a side of their French toast with halva which I generally wouldn't eat but I actually really enjoyed it in this instance. My husband had a vegetable soup and really enjoyed it as well. We definitely would come back for brunch again.

We love this local Park Slope restaurant - they offer a fantastic brunch, but we've been relying on them for dinner takeout over the last few months. Each entree (like the shwarmas and schnitzel) easily lasts 2-3 meals! Our family has someone with a sesame (tahini) allergy, so we typically avoid Middle Eastern restaurants. However, the Miriam team is so considerate of allergies (their website homemadebymiriam.com lists top allergens for their different menu items) and we've been able to enjoy many different menu items without incident.

Had a great Monday morning brunch here after my friend and I tried to go to Sweet Chick but it wasn't open yet. I'm so glad we ended up at Miriam as it's so much better anyway.
We went on MLK Day which a lot of people had off and while it was crowded, we still got a table.
My friend got the shukshuka and raved about it.
Prices were fine.
I had the eggs Benedict and it was so good. And I'm kind of an eggs Benedict snob. :)
Coffee was good. Would definitely go back.

We came here for breakfast with our mom and we had a great time. It was pretty empty when we came in on Tuesday morning. We were seated immediately. I ordered the challah french toast with a cappuccino. My mom ordered the herbed eggs with tea and my twin ordered the Israeli breakfast with regular coffee. We don't have any complaints about anything. The food was really good. Our waiter was attentive. I'd come back.

This is by far my favorite spot for breakfast. I recommend coming here closer to their opening time considering the wait time. We come on a Friday morning to avoid it. The food is delicious always fresh and the waiters are very attentive. My usual is the burekas brunch meal and I never finish it, but it is sooooo delicious. We sometimes get the lamb sausage on the side, hummus or potato pancake. I'm not crazy about the pancake but everything else is amazing. I rate this spot 10/10. If you don't like something they will change it and offer you something else ( my husband didn't like the coffee so they offered a mocha latte and he said it was amazing ) great decor, great food and awesome vibe :)

Atmosphere is great, service is good but the food is really bad. it pains me to give a bad review because I love Mediterranean food.

Listen, I lived in the Middle East for 5 years and traveled all over including Africa, Greece etc and never in my life  I ate such a bitter and crappy Humus and a horrendous Shawarma like in this place.

For appetizers we asked for the flat bread which was ok, the humus Plate (terrible) and a salad which was good. Main entree we got the Shinitzel with mash potatoes and the lamb Shawarma.

The mash was tasteless but shinitzel was pretty good. I have no words for their version of  Shawarma.
I get that this neighborhood is yuppie and they try to look cool with ""fusion"" like plates. Presentation is important  no doubt but the taste is what really matters and they failed  miserably here.

The meat tasted like a washed up stew and smelled weird with an overpowering orange sauce. It was so bad that we were not able to eat much of the plate.

I give them props because the place was packed and everyone was buying their awesome decor and ambience but it doesn't work for me...  I rather seat in a hole in the wall with great food.

I appreciate the friendly, but regimented seating, and service protocols.

We were greeted warmly on a slow day by the bartender who gave us our choice of seat, after which, a server appeared.

I took a flyer and ordered a frozen painkiller, which had a nice taste to the very end of the drink, having never become diluted or watery; do the use insulated cups?

We also saw that they have aged Manhattan's, I believe.

We will return, with enthusiasm.

I think Elsa is a cute little spot on Atlantic Avenue. I like that on a Friday or Saturday night you can usually walk in and find a table. I also think that they have an interesting drink selection.

My only two recommendations/hesitations with them which is why I gave them four stars instead of five is the fact that sometimes I find their drinks overpriced for the quality of the drink. The additional reason I knocked off one star is that sometimes I find the staff to be not especially friendly or helpful. I understand they are in a neighborhood where image can be very important but I think that being kind is never lost on the people who are coming to your establishment to spend money.

Saturday 5pm. 5 friends (+ baby sleeping in stroller).

Loved the decor and ambiance of this place. The bathroom...is a designer's dream. I would come here over and over again. We are some old and new friends meeting up from various parts of the city (and from out of town) in this cozy yet stylish bar on Atlantic Ave. The front is unassuming but the bar goes back fairly far and there is open seating with low tables and stools that feels pretty private. It was perfect as we rolled the sleeping baby into facing the corner wall as we all got to catch up.

Drinks were very good and service was great too! I'll be back to try the food and more cocktails.

Drinks - not bad, pretty good
Price - alright, decent, price pretty acceptable tbh
Atmosphere - clean, good vibe
Service - there was an sign, wait to be seated, waiting 2-3 min and the bartender realized we were standing there and then they get the service ti sit us down. Lack of attention maybe?
Dress code - people there dress pretty business casual kinda thing.

Over good experience, if you by yourself looking for an place to have a drink or two, no. Not here. Its loud, and you will need an friend to be here with you, not a great place to be left along and enjoy your ""alone"" time if u get what i mean. So yeah , bring an friend if you visiting this place.

If you like old fashion like i do, this place is not bad, $10 buck. But of course they other drinks too peep

What a wonderful cocktail bar!

Came here based on a recommendation and I'm in love.

First of all this bar is BEAUTIFUL. Has a French modern art deco feel to it. I think this is the prettiest cocktail bar I've ever been to. The interior is elegant, with a lot of neutral colors, especially whites and creams and cozy lights. The atmosphere is fantastic.
Cozy booths and tables in the midst of everything and some quite tables in the back.
Even the bathroom is gorgeous!!

Great cocktails and great service. Quality drinks and some talented bar tenders.
My favorite was the 'two French sisters' it's light, citrusy and a little sweet - amazing cocktail!! It's vodka and orange based and topped with champagne.
I would skip the glassine stamp. It was extremely bitter.
The 24k gold was delicious and comes in a mug.
Seriously the cocktails are too notch!

A few snacks like nuts and olives, but really not much food around here.

Definitely in the top 5 of my favorite bars in NYC

There is one thing about the food/drink service industry that I will never understand: why do people who hate other people seek jobs in bars and restaurants?

An example of this is the staff at Elsa. The hostess doesn't even smile or say 'hello' - weird, but ok. The grey-haired man with a ponytail, wire-frame glasses and a dirty Joy Division t-shirt however, is a whole new level of rude. He is the quintessential awful New York bartender - blaze, uninterested, depressed, too-good-to-be-nice, frustrated, getting-old-and-still-working-at-a-bar, I'm-getting-my-tip-anyway creature.

I don't understand why people like that want to work in hospitality. But what's even more confusing is why owners/managers don't recognize that awful service can ruin an experience.

An extra star for a wonderful design and good vibe (created by patrons, not staff.)

Stopped by Elsa after dinner on a Thursday early evening and it was pretty busy on the inside! We got seated quickly but the remaining tables quickly got filled after us.
The decor is awesome and the vibe feels good. The happy hour had good prices and would definitely recommend the wine punch! We didn't have other drinks but just wanted to check the place out. The back area seems like an amazing place to hold an event and something I'll think of in the future.
I was in between a 4 and 5 stars due to the service speed. When we stopped by, we weren't really looking to stay for more than one drink so we didn't care for much service, but it did seem a little slow. Hoping the next time we go that this slow service isn't a constant.

It gets 3 stars for being a totally gorgeous bar. The bathroom is stupidly lovely, and the light fixtures and seating are so pretty.

Cocktail wise, pretty good. Not always a 10/10, but a good variety and interesting flavors.

The reason for two missing stars is the staff. They seem a bit cold and pretentious. It was strange, just a couple of unfriendly bartenders really ruined things for us. And this isn't the first time I've experienced this.

It's a sexy spot, but the bartenders could be a bit more warm if they want people to come back.

Really awesome cocktail bar!  We came here at ~8pm on a Friday evening and were able to get seats (but some of the last ones).  Service was great, drinks even better.  I had a Vivian Darkbloom and Death of a Ladies Man -- both were absolutely delicious in different ways, reasonably boozy, and a fair deal given normal NYC cocktail prices.  I also sampled the other 5 drinks my friends had, and all were also delicious in unique ways.

We'll definitely be going back!

I went to Elsa on Friday evening with a couple of my friends (Girls night out). This spot couldn't be cuter. The white and black interior is polka dotted with art, and has big spanning booth. It's a clean retro design.

Cocktails are definitely on the expensive side, but not any more than NYC standards. It's worth it to sip and chat with friends for a while. Me and one friend had the Two French Sisters, and my other friend had the Handsome Grandson. The Two French Sisters is a vodka, St. Germain, Champagne drink, not as much of that ""cocktail look"" as the other one, but tasted very fresh. I sipped the Handsome Grandson and it was fruitier.

The cocktails here are artful concoctions that you can't find anywhere else. They taste delicious, and interesting - not trying too hard by putting too many flavors in one glass.

A nice place to dress up and go out with the ladies!

Such a cool bar. We celebrated a friend's birthday here and had a whole section blocked off all to ourselves. It was perfect! I love the aesthetic of this place- the bathrooms are selfie worthy. I loved every drink I tasted, two French sisters, the golden fang, the handsome grandson, and the painkiller (like a refreshing pina colada). I think my favorite drink though is unfortunately one I don't remember the name to and can't find on the menu pictures it had coconut in it and came in a little tea cup. Would order this 5x order and be a drunken mess for sure. The wait staff was excellent and they stored an ice cream cake in their freezer for us. Overall a great way to spend an evening in

Elsa has a great vibe - the decor is up to date and very comfortable to relax for a quick beverage, which is exactly what we did.

The bar staff was a bit non-chalant and weren't the BIGGEST helps on drink decisions, but I settled on the self-portrait.  It was amazingly delicious.  The cilantro tequila and habanero combined to form a spicy yet punchy pop when drinking this delightful concoction.

We were one and done on this trip; my friend had an average old fashioned - but it was a great stop.  I highly recommend to anyone in the neighborhood.

Oh so many people packed here on a Saturday night. Luckily my friend reserved a table in the back for us otherwise you can still hang by the bar.

This place is super romantic but not quiet or fancy dress up place. You can come in Jean and t-shirt but if you want to impress that date, you should make a little effort. I don't see any food on the menu but there are a couple pizzaria around the corner or Mediterranean food.

Drinks. They make some mean stuff. All broken down in the categories like gin, whiskey or rum and on and on. I enjoyed their gin section  Happy hour is 5 to 7pm with like 6 to 7 option for half the price. Beside that, it will be the typical NYC price for drinks. I still can't rationalize the cost of alcohol. If I go down this road, this whole review page will be about that. Anyway, the drink comes with funny names which you can read on the attached image.

Service is great and remember to tip well.

Grabbed drinks at Elsa late on a Friday night. The style is all there, but I just was not crazy about the quality of the drinks.

Quality: Elsa was a few stops into the night, so I was not in the mood for my own cocktail. I went with a local IPA and it was a solid choice. I did however get a few sips of Perfume-V, which is tequila, creme de violette, St. Germain, egg white, lemon, and rose water. It sounded and looked better than it tasted. I got the impression from my group that was the case across the board. Pretty and intriguing, but not that great.
Quantity: Standard pours for both beers and cocktails.
Value: Cocktails range from $12 to $16. Beers fall between $5 and $9.
Ambiance: Elsa is a cocktail bar located along Atlantic Ave in Brooklyn. I think the space looks much more like a brunch spot than a cocktail bar, and maybe that is why the crowd looked similar. Following the modern farmhouse decor style that is so popular, the space combines industrial and rustic elements into a chic design. The shape and color of the walls with the yellow glowing lights give this vague feeling that you are on an airplane or train from back in time. The music however is current pop hits, knocking you out of that illusion.
Crowd: Very busy on Friday night. The stylish bar brings in a young, hip crowd.
Service: We were a larger group and I appreciated how the staff went out of their way to accommodate us. However, once we sat down, it was very tough to catch someone's eye.
Parking: Difficult to find a street spot in the area.

Came here on a whim while walking around on a nice night from Henry st after having a bizarre encounter with a new acquaintance. I felt like the night needed to end on a good note. I trickled into this place for a last glass for the night. I'm so glad I did! I walked in and was instantly pleased with the aesthetic of the bar. It has a very chic, modern, Art Deco lay out. The bartender was nice and pleasant. He welcomed me and even laughed at my previous experience elsewhere. The drinks are really decently priced.  They have booths as well as bar seating throughout the bar, so no lack of seating here. The bathrooms are very picturesque worthy as they have a studio feel, perfect for those IG ops. But don't hog them up, because they're unisex and only 2 available - so be considerate. The ambiance is grown and laid back - perfect for those quiet nights over convo and good drinks!

Love great discoveries. Especially in the form of a cozy bar with great drinks. Didn't have much of the bites offered besides the cheese plate. Had 3 different cocktails though which were fantastic. Service was also on point with our server giving great recommendations and always nearby. Will return!

I'm going to try my best not to make a Frozen joke.

What's no joke is Elsa's cocktail program. It's truly next level, and one of the best I've seen in Brooklyn, if not all of NYC. Makes sense with their pedigree (Elsa was previously in the East Village, and their sister bar is the renowned Ramona in Greenpoint). Elsa exudes creativity in spades and doesn't take it self overly seriously like some other cocktail bars.

I will go on record that the Harpooned Heart is one of the best cocktails I've had in a long, long time. Sure, it's served in a tiki mug, but there's no shame in that. Vodka, coconut, almond, vanilla, mint, lime, pineapple, and peppercorn bitters. OH, and it's garnished with a goddamn Ferrero Raffaello! Are you trying to get into my pants, Elsa?

My second drink was the Handsome Grandson, which was a light gin drink with basil. Well balanced and dangerously crushable.

I also tried the Self Portrait, which was a great, spicy tequila drink with cilantro. Strong and delicious.

They also do vinegar shrubs (which sounds like a Pokemon item), but is actually drinking vinegar mixed with alcohol and spices. You can get gin, vodka, or tequila. It kind of tastes like a pickleback (on account of the dill), but way more complex than that. You get some spice with the jalapeno, and some sweetness with the mango/pineapple. Definitely worth trying, as I don't think I've ever had anything like it.

The space is beautiful. It used to be Last Exit (with whom I've had a... history). But they've completely gut renovated the old dive bar into something beautiful. Very art deco, like something out of a World's Fair poster or from Ayn Rand cover art. Whoever designed the place really put amazing thought into it. Just one of the small things I noticed was that the booth tables were built with alcohol lamps in mind. There's also a railing of light bisecting the entire length of the bar, like train tracks. There's what appear to be hand blown glass lighting fixtures. Oh, and the bathroom is gorgeous. Without exaggeration, one of the coolest bathrooms ever. Mirrored on all sides and well lit. Might I say, selfie bait?

The place is also deceptively large. There's a back area, and they have a patio!

We came here on the Sunday of Labor Day, and it was a surprisingly big crowd (even saw people getting there in Ubers). So I imagine it's even more busy on a regular weekend. I can see them eating Long Island Bar's lunch since their cocktails are better and the space/drinks are way more Instagrammable. If only they served more food than just meat and cheese from Stinky's!

Oh, and speaking of Frozen, they also do frozen cocktails. That doesn't count as a joke.

Solid cocktails in a fun looking place.

Prices are so-so for decent cocktails. Ranging from $13-16/each, which is affordable for the amount of liquor they contain. Honestly 2 was plenty for me, and I do drink enough. That being said - it was worth the overall cost, but my wallet wouldn't let me frequent this place.

Service was slow and slightly rude. A bunch of people were working, not sure where the slowdown was, but it took a good 15 minutes to order a drink - and that was with nobody else waiting ahead of me. Was not impressed by the callous attitude some of the bartenders had, but it is fitting for the atmosphere of this place... arrogance and cocktails probably just go together¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

To the drinks I had: Glassine Stamp was tasty, as was their Old Fashioned. I'd definitely order either one again.

Excellent bar! I came by while waiting for a table at a nearby restaurant and was not disappointed. Their old fashioned is $10, which is great for a nice cocktail spot. It tasted very refreshing and citrusy (comes with both orange and lemon peel). I also tried the Forever Ever IPA (on draught) which was delicious! It might be unfiltered, and has notes of pine and citrus and is very refreshing.

The atmosphere is awesome! There are funky lights everywhere and mini booths that are comfortable. I'd love to come back and try many of their cocktails and appetizers.

My husband and I came to this cocktail bar to have a relaxed nightcap after our weekly dinner date. He was very sure that I would love the place and boy was he right!! I had a GREAT MEZCAL DRINK called Vivian Darkbloom! I was afraid the bitters would be too over powering but it was not, it was perfect!! Now, my favorite part was the bathroom! I am a sucker for a well thought-out bathroom and this was definitely delivered!! The candles had an amazing fragrance with some earthy wood smells to it (I even took a picture of the candle to buy it for my apartment!) and the ceiling was an impressive mirror arch! (My photo does not do it justice!) I highly recommend this place as a well-rounded cocktail bar!!

I'm trying this new thing where I don't drink until I start yelling at inanimate objects anymore. Elsa is both good and bad for this new me.

On the one hand, the cocktails are actually fantastic, which makes me want to have 7-12 of them. But on the other, they all cost between $10-$16, which necessarily limits the number I can have because I'm poor.

Unfortunately for Moderation March (as I have dubbed this endeavor), Elsa's space is so goddamn gorgeous that I want to move in. And if I'm going to live here, I'm probably going to do a bunch of drinking. (How else am I supposed to pass the time? The cell service in here is terrible.)

Seriously, this room is fantastic. If you'd never been to Last Exit (the previous tenant), please believe me when I say that place was basically a toilet of a bar that had a decent backyard. By contrast, Elsa is bright, sleek, and tasteful. They did not skimp on the renovation. Are those light fixtures hand-blown? The pink accents on the leather booths (a surprising amount of comfortable seating in here) are also leather? There's a full on mirrored tunnel in the bathroom?!

The only thing more beautiful than the reno is the cocktail program. There isn't a single option on this menu that I don't want to try. Having had a few already, I can report that they taste as good as they sound. Whether you're a whiskey, gin, vodka, or agave spirit drinker, there's something here that you're going to like:

The Two French Sisters reminds me of champagne brunches in New Orleans (at the Court of Two Sisters). The Black Book is a spicy selection reminiscent of a hot toddy, but drinkable all year long. The Golden Fang is a pink drink that makes me feel like more of a man (no mean feat).

Overall, Elsa moving into our neighborhood feels serendipitous. Not only did my wife and I used to live right by their old location in Alphabet City, but a few of our friends (also now in this part of Brooklyn) did as well. All of us gathering here for a few cocktails after work feels like coming home.

Three minor complaints:

1. I wish they had more food beyond the small snacks (olives, nuts, cheese).
2. A happy hour would go a long way toward letting me pay my mortgage.
3. One of my friends said their candles looked like a diaphragm. Which led to a lengthy discussion of why he knows what a diaphragm looks like, the logistics of using a diaphragm, and so forth. I could've done without that.

But other than that, I couldn't be happier to have them in the hood.

Went there tonight for a night cap with my husband and we tried their famous frozen cocktails. They were just perfect! We loved the cocktails, the atmosphere and the service. Good job Elsa! We will definitely come back!

I really wanted to review this place better because their cocktails are great. Our server was horrible. She carried every drink in hand, spread fingers so her prints were all over our glasses. It was busy, understood, but they should probably put another server on as it took us forever to get another drink order in it took me 28 minutes to be recognized, order, and receive my order. She was unfriendly, and it seemed like we inconvenienced her every time we ordered. We actually waived another server over and when I ordered he told me they didn't have lime juice (huh? most of their cocktails have lime juice in it), I told him I'm sure they did and true enough he returned with my drink. THEN she never told me she included gratuity on the check (which by itself Is ILLEGAL), so I double tipped!!!! Heading home I looked at my receipt and realized. I will never be returning. What a shame it's actually a beautiful a space.

These cocktails are seriously amazing. Depending on my mood, aka do I want to pay $5-8 for a happy hour standard old fashioned, sazarac, beer, or wine, OR do I want one of their signature libations from heaven at $13plus is my on going debate. All our good. But I can't find a drink that I stick with ONLY because I know the next one will surprise me with splendor. Portrait stands out currently as a go to. Vibe is chill, music is good, service is on point. Wish they had more food options but I get it. Love having Elsa in the hood.

Super cute place with an amazing cocktail menu. We got the aperol spritz, Hotel danger, the golden fang, and the red wine. All very good- would recommend the Golden Fang. Not a lot of food options if that's what you're looking for

Still the best cocktail bar on Atlantic

Love the use of vinegar in their ""shrub"" drinks. They pack a punch with a unique taste that is often lost with many modern day cocktail bars.

I am a frequent customer here and so should you! They offer a laid back atmosphere with hints of retro nostalgia. The bartenders know what they are doing and will provide you with great guidance on the drink that best suits your palette.

Naturally, this place can be busy on Thursday/Friday with space limited. The wait is worth it but if you are looking for a less hectic first experience, opt for Monday-Wednesday.

What took me soo long....

I can't believe that was the first time I visited this amazing cocktail spot on Atlantic...

At first I was a bit concerned that this could be a trap. Could this be a spot for would be hipsters to congregate and discuss the latest apple product or could this be a legitimate cocktail bar? Thankfully the latter prevailed and Elsa is a hit!

The bartenders are friendly and make a damn good drink! The atmosphere is a throwback that infuses art deco aesthetics mixed with solid mood lighting...

This might have to be my new spot!!

When I heard there was a new Elsa Schiaparelli inspired bar in the hood, I put it on the top of my list of places to try! I planned a happy hour with 3 other girlfriends, meeting here during a week day around 5:30. There was a decent amount of groups seated, but it was also no problem to get a table. The inside was beautiful, as expected, with little nods to the designer. The bathroom, which my friend described as looking like a ""futuristic space ship"" was probably the best room in the bar!! They also had an outdoor patio filled with people which is a nice feature as well!
The happy hour deals were pretty good, with one white, red, and rose wine discounted as well as some beers. Our biggest problem with the place was the staff. As in, there was ONE server for all the tables inside and out it appeared. So it was frustrating trying to get drinks, and frustrating how long we had to wait for check after asking twice. It's probably not the servers fault, as it was clearly an owners staffing issue problem, but it was enough for us to leave with negative feelings towards the bar. Which is disappointing as it had so much potential in the area.

Elsa is like stepping back into time, when men wore suits, subways took tokens, leather booths were white, and bartenders could mix a stiff drink with just enough showmanship to earn their tip.

They make a mean Sazerac. If you don't know what is, they're $7 during happy hour and you should just order one based on a lackluster Yelp review.

Elsa? No Anna here. Oh Frozen references! That's how I think about this fantastic cocktail bar in Clinton Hill but it is also entirely related.

Came here on a whim after trekking through all of Brooklyn Bridge Park with a friend and being dehydrated, we were seeking beverages to cool us down and after passing by places shook our heads no to, Elsa was beacon of cocktail coolness.

For about $10-$18 each cocktail, there is a bevy of options to choose from whatever your drink preference is from the classics, gin, rum, whisky, rum, absinthe, beer, wine, and other spirits. Due to the blazing summer weather, we were thinking maybe a beer but the sign in front of the bar had FROZEN DRINKS. Considering my friend and I were seeing mirages before we arrived at Elsa, we went for the frozen section and ordered the Contortionist Jazz Exotica which was a twist of the Salted Watermelon Rose & Black Pepper Moscow Mule plus a Montauk watermelon ale.

The Exotica has got to be the best frozen cocktail I've had ever. The black pepper in the moscow mule gave it a little kick and the salt in the watermelon rose elevated the sweetness of the watermelon. It's what summer drinks are made of. The minor quibble I have with Elsa is their selection of snacks which is a mere cheese/charcuterie plate, olives, and roasted nuts. Not much to choose from so hoping they expand the menu a bit more in the future.

The outdoor patio is gorgeous from the brief look of it from up above. It is a spacious space and it gets crowded. Service was great with a cool laid back atmosphere. There is a happy hour too from Monday to Friday if you're ever in the area and want a drink. Elsa is a standout cocktail bar for sure.

Happy drinking and remember: Don't deny, satisfy!

One of my favorite cocktail bars in the neighborhood! The service and drinks are excellent. Great spot for meeting up with your girlfriends, date nights, or a night to yourself. Highly recommend the Two French Sister cocktail drink - refreshingly addicting! The bathroom is what you call an ""instragramable"" spot. The mirrors were a little bizarre for my taste but still a spectacle.

Despite a wealth of Yelp reviews written in the days when I still lived in Providence, RI, I haven't felt compelled to speak my piece on any establishment since moving to the city some years ago. Most of the buzzed-about haunts and must-visit locales in New York have been complimented, critiqued, and crusaded against to a degree that made my particular two-cents arguably superfluous. Yet my experience at Elsa, the latest libation destination in the Cobble Hill area, was so superb, that I felt compelled- perhaps, obligated- to sing their praises.

The decor of the bar, for starters, is the increasingly ubiquitous collision of clean, modern lines, coupled with such antiquated features as candles, exposed piping, and lamps that harken to a previous era. The design is featured at many newer bars in the city, yet Elsa manages to make the idea unique, and avoids the faux pas of appearing to be a clich√©. The mirrored theme throughout executed equally flawlessly, and is an attractive feature in the bathrooms in particular.

However, the real star of the show has to be the beverage program, which is thoughtful, creative, and most importantly, diverse - bars too often craft their programs whilst leaning excessively on one or two spirits; here, the menu was diverse, and desired extensive options for lovers of any liquor variation. Every cocktail I ordered was expertly crafted by my tender of bar, Keegan in this case.

Not only do I recommend this bar to anyone who may reside in the area; any self-respecting enthusiast of mixology would do well to visit as soon as possible.

This place was fantastic! We made a reservation for Friday night and our table was ready when we arrived at the restaurant. The entire staff was wearing masks and everyone dining in the outdoor patio was safely distanced from one another.

Their menu has shortened due to COVID and was brought out on a lovely black board. We ended up ordering focaccia for the table, the sirloin burger, and the hanger steak. Everything was exceptional. The meat was cooked exactly how we ordered and was flavored and seasoned to perfection. And those potatoes...YUM! The food was also beautifully plated.

I will definitely be returning to try out their pasta and seafood! Check them out!!

My friend and I came here for outdoor seating during Covid. Their outdoor garden has a nice ambiance and seating was well spaced out. They have hand sanitizer available as you walk in to enter the garden. They even put something under the tables to ward off bugs at night. The restroom was also clean and easy to access.

The food was really good. We shared the Bacchus salad as an appetizer which was fresh and loaded with different types of fruit. For our entrees, we both ordered the Black Angus Ribeye which was quite tasty and a good portion...neither of us were able to finish it and took the rest for leftovers. They also have a good wine list and we were happy with the bottle of wine they recommended for us.

My only complaint was that service was a bit slow and not as attentive as I would have liked (we had to wave down the waiter a few times), so I wouldn't recommend coming here if you are rushing to do something afterwards. But I would definitely recommend it for it's outdoor seating and delicious food.

Bacchus Bistro was heaven on earth! Meryl was so flexible and reliable. We definitely could not have had a our beautiful wedding without her! We originally had a contract for September 2020 but due to covid we contacted Meryl and asked to have our date changed to July 2020. It was literally 2 weeks before our wedding and Meryl and the team were so open and willing to work with us, we were set for our dinner. Then just 1 week before our wedding, we called for yet another adjustment, we needed to actually host our full ceremony at Bacchus due to the rain. Little questions asked, it was set and our wedding was perfect. Meryl and the team were flexible and assured we were able to practice social distancing and staying safe. On the day of our wedding, it was pouring rain with thunder and lighting and the show went on! The team added covers to the back garden to block the rain. Meryl was attentive and made sure we had everything we needed from food to wine to cutting our cake and providing to-go cake boxes. Ugh! We could not be more grateful for Meryl and the Team at Bacchus Bistro. We can't wait to go back for our Anniversary dinner!

I took a friend to Bacchus for a fancy birthday meal, and felt really guilty, because it was just as much of a gift to myself as it was to my friend. Bacchus is definitely now one of my favorite restaurants in Brooklyn!

The food here is incredible - the menu changes every week, but it's safe to assume that delicious, hearty, seasonal dishes will be waiting to fill you up. We shared a ribeye that was cooked to perfection. Medium rare actually meant medium rare, and the flavor was spot on.

Bacchus is definitely worth splurging for a nice night out or a special occasion!

We came to dinner here one fine Friday evening and had such a fantastic time. Our server was very friendly and made great conversation within a few minutes of being there.

The service was phenomenal, drinks were brought out minutes after they were ordered. The food did not take long to come out from the kitchen. Although I didn't get photos of everything the one thing I did get of a photo of was very delicious!

I would highly recommend coming here for date night or a cute dinner with the girls.

When was the last time you had the option to order a Methuselah sized bottle of wine with dinner? Maybe it's more common than I realize, but this was a first for me. Still, if I had to choose between ordering one of their better ones versus filling my house's tank with heating oil...

I can't decide if I want to describe this place as having food fancier than atmosphere, or atmosphere more casual than the food. And I don't mean that as negatives, I enjoyed the combination, and service that was attentive and yet equally casual and familiar.

I liked that certain menu options came in a variety of choices, such as appetizers vs. entrees vs. small plates. And by that I mean DUCK, specifically the duck leg confit this time. The combination of the crispy exterior with the tender meat was pleasing to the palate. I combined that with a special for the evening, a salad featuring roasted beets, and I dined very well. We did go for a much more modest bottle of wine to go with our dinner, but we were completely satisfied with it, and I have a feeling that the wines in general pair well with meals here, despite my lack familiarity with most of them.

It does get a bit crowded and loud here, which relates to my opinion of the casual nature here. Don't let that make you uncomfortable, enjoy the food and drink here.

I appreciate hearing from you! By the way, our largest bottle is a Melchoir (18Liters), like a few very large formats, they are on a different wine list!

They're really a 4.5, but I'm rounding up because I had a consistently pleasant culinary experience more than once.

The first time, I was in a the backyard area which is dressed up for nice little gatherings. The food was provided by Bacchus and it was great!

That was what brought me back to Bacchus for the regular dining menu this time. And I was not disappointed! (it was pricey though).

I ordered the big meat special because why wouldn't I? You get different cuts of beef, chicken and duck! It was so big that we couldn't finish it. We also ordered the sauce flight, which was nice but I might not do again. I'm not sure I'm a big enough fan of mushroom based sauces.

One time I visited this place, a cool and trendy French employee accidentally knocked my half eaten dinner plate on the floor. I cried hungry tears, but he immediately apologised, put in a new order for me, and gave me a GIANT serving of my same meal. I was too full and was going to ask for the check, but his act was so kind! I still asked them to wrap it up and happily had the meal the next day. The service here is fantastic, the food is delicious, and the atmosphere is excellent! I have been here so many times and never get tired. The outdoor space is beautiful for events (birthdays and weddings), but also for just dodging the summer sun beating down on you. I love this place!

I came here for my cousin's bridal shower so there was a pre fix menu. First off, it's a lovely venue if you're wanting to host an event. There was a baby shower happening right next to us but weren't bothered by them at all.

The food all in all was absolutely delicious. I seriously do not have anything negative to say about any of the dishes I received.

Crab cake was full of crab meat and really good.

The hanger steak is making me drool just by writing this.

The creme br√ªl√©e as you would expect. Perfect.

I'd definitely come back again to try the rest of the menu.

Had a nice experience with our server(two starts goes to him), but unfortunately not really pleased by management. Absolutely rude and not capable of talking to the customers in the right way. No hi - no bye.
Don't think we will be back.

I hate croque madames (mesdames?). And then I met your croque madame. Bread was perfection, the egg was cooked exactly as I asked for it to be cooked, the potatoes that came with it were nicely firm (not soggy and not dry).

I'm making a list of places I will go just to sit there once this is over. I will definitely see you.

5 Stars for a dimly-lit, romantic French restaurant that serves up quality dishes and makes you want to throw a beautiful party out back.

Damn. This place is romantic! I had the chance to stop by recently (thanks to the stellar reviews) and we were sat very quickly near the back glass doors. It was chilly out, but warm and romantically-lit inside.

The atmosphere inside is top notch, but while we were there we caught glimpses of the outside back area and could just imagine how magical it would be in the right weather.

Beyond atmosphere, the food and drinks were on-point. I ordered a red wine and described my preferences to the knowledgeable server who made a selection for me that didn't disappoint.

The bread they bring is warm and addictive, but save it for the mussels!

We ordered the following:
Root Vegetables Salad- roasts beets, turnips, pistachios, goat cheese, fris√©e salad, mustard dressing, and balsamic glaze. This was a fresh, light entry into our main dishes.

Mussel and French Fries- holy white wine broth, Batman! I was thankful I'd held on to some of that bread to soak up that sauce. This was a lot less expensive than it could have been. And at $19, it's worth it even as a starter.

Homemade Purple Potato Gnocchi- light as a feather! Gosh, I hate dense gnocchi, but this was made with love.

Overall, a solid date night spot to which I would absolutely return!

My wife and I came here for an anniversary brunch. We ordered the bottomless mimosas + main option for $30. I had the crabcake benedict and she had the chicken salad sandwich. Both were excellent, and I wouldn't hesitate to order anything off the menu. The coffee and cocktails were great, as were the creme br√ªl√©e and chocolate mousse we had for dessert. The atmosphere was intimate but lively, with rustic French decor and many other brunch groups enjoying their morning as much as us

What was best about our experience was the service. Blanca was kind, friendly, and attentive. She would refill our drinks before we had finished them, and she checked in regularly without being overbearing. Some of the best service I've ever received at any restaurant. Can't say enough. Please come and visit.

3/12/2020Max, happy anniversary! It makes me smile to hear how much you and your wife enjoyed coming by for brunch. Thank you for taking a couple of minutes to share some kind things about our food, service and atmosphere. It's great that you both loved the different entrees you ordered as well as the bottomless mimosas and desserts. Hope to see you again!

Have a great rest of your week,
Bruno Laclide

Impressive outdoor seating! The tables are well spaced apart and they show you a large menu sign instead of handing out menus. There's even a shortcut to the bathroom from the back so you don't have to walk in to the restaurant to access it. Service was prompt and food was good! I ordered the foie gras to start, salmon for the main course and chocolate lava cake for dessert. The foie gras was good but the chestnut puree and date made the dish a little heavy. Would've preferred a fruit preserve or onion jam instead. The salmon was delicious - served medium rare on beet mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts with a lemon caper sauce. I would order this again. The dessert was subpar. I've had better chocolate lava cake, but I do appreciate that the center was oozing! My husband had the ribeye steak with roasted crispy potatoes, mushrooms and a creamy peppercorn sauce. I was salivating the entire time. Would love to come back and try more dishes!

Came for brunch and we were able to be seated right away without having reservations. Cute spot, but the food was lackluster. The burger was bland and needed seasoning and the potatoes were also mediocre. I'd skip this place for food but come for the wine selection.

2/26/2020Abby, I'm sorry to hear that your burger didn't wow you when you came by for brunch. That said, I do appreciate you taking a moment to share your thoughts and I will address your concerns with the kitchen on my end. If you're ever inclined to come by for some wine and perhaps try something else on the menu, I'd love to welcome you back.

Have a great rest of your week,
Bruno Laclide

The Albaro manager was super rude. That was my girlfriend's birthday and we had a party of 7ppl. My girlfriend and I showed up on time and the ""manager"" said: ""your table will be ready in 4-5 mins."" After 30 mins waiting outside we asked him again about our table and he cursed us that our company is not here anyway. I could understand if he at least leted us know the situation and canceled the reservation. I told  him we have made this reservation a week ago and the restaurant has my credit card to guarantee the reservation, he started yelling at me at the middle of the restaurant and just walked away. The worst experience ever not talking about the mood and atmosphere in general. The whole evening has been spoiled. And I don't care about how ""cool"" this place, it's unacceptable.  Will never go there away and I, personally, make sure none of my friends or clients go there ever. Good luck with business. And if you want a shity service,  that's the place to go to.

10/10/2020Hi Maksiim,

I have already answer to your girlfriend, so I am just going to copy the same answer to you.

I am happy to see you enjoyed your food, both the branzino and the hanger steak and Alpi, your server.
My manager Alvaro, who works with me for the past 12 years, and have an outstanding reputation with our customers, just applied our reservation policy.
You had a reservation on Saturday night for 7 people at 7pm. Two of you arrived at 7:20pm and the rest of your party at 8:00pm. You blocked 8 covers, for one hour, on Saturday night, in a restaurant with limited space due to Covid 19 rules and regulations. Our outdoor capacity is not even 30% of what we have usually. Instead of being upset against Alvaro, you should have thanks him for keeping your table during all this time.
He couldn't served you any drinks, because no alcohol can be served without food, all patrons know that now.

In such a difficult time, we need from our customers to understand the importance of being on time when they make a reservation.
We hope to see you back soon at Bacchus.

Best regards,
Bruno Laclide

3/16/2020Good evening Karen,
I am sorry to hear you didn't stay yesterday night. The dining room is a nice area that people love. Blanca seat you over there because the wine bar and the bistro were full. We had two waiters and one sommelier/waiter working yesterday night. More than 60 people came in less than 30 minutes with one lady in wheel chair we didn't know about. We had to change the entire set-up for the party of 15 she was part of.
We did our best but I understand your frustration but understand also this is sometime not a problem we generated but others and we always try our best and be helpful. I really hope you will try us again because our regulars love us for what I just explained before, and we would love to impress you the next time.
Thank you for sharing your feelings.
Best regards,
Bruno

Went here for a friends wedding. First of all the back outdoor area is beautiful! We got very lucky with the weather and everything was just perfect! The food was terrific! They had a prefix menu for the event. I got the crab cake, pasta with shrimp and creme br√ªl√©e for dessert. Everything was just delicious! They were serving a white wine for the table which was great as well! The service was very good! Will be back here for dinner!

We enjoyed a New Year's Eve dinner at this cozy restaurant. The wine choices are infinite and impressive . All the courses were presented so pleasing to the eye as well as taste. Our waiter was very enthusiastic & determined to find a wine taste to suit our son which he successfully did. We got an early reservation and we were not rushed to finish . The restaurant grew more crowded but we were able to enjoy each course and drinks with relaxation. My husband enjoyed a couple of generous glasses of beer as we loved our wine . They topped most of the presentations with beautiful edible flowers, all portions were just right and to add to the final touch the desserts were just perfect! We would definitely be back for a date night if we are in the area or special celebration. So glad we had our New Years Eve dinner here!

Been here twice, once for a small intimate wedding and the second time for my mother's birthday. The courses at the wedding were delicious so we decided to give the restaurant another try for a special occasion. Overall, we enjoyed the food although there were some misses. Service was friendly and attentive.

We tried the Foie Gras Torchon, Snails, and Salmon & Avocado Tartar for appetizers. We also ordered the Mussels in Mariniere (white wine, shallots and garlic broth) & French Fries to share. Appetizers were excellent and we enjoyed them more than our entrees.

For entrees, I ordered the Short Ribs Pot-au-Feu, but didn't really enjoy the meat; it was too chewy and fatty for me. I ended up eating the vegetables and sharing the meat with everyone else. My husband had the White Wine Veal Osso-Bucco, which he hated; the meat was dry and tasteless. My brother had the Red Wine Braised Lamb Shank, which he said was decent. His girlfriend had the Roasted 1/2 Chicken. My mother enjoyed the Black Angus Hanger Steak. My father had the 14oz Black Angus Rib Eye Steak, which we agreed was the best entree of our table; it was perfectly cooked and tender.

For dessert, we ordered the molten lava cake, the chocolate mousse cake, and the creme brulee to share. They added a birthday candle to the cake for my mother and kindly gave us a slice of pumpkin pie on the house. While some of the entrees were disappointing, the appetizers and dessert were great. Atmosphere was cozy and inviting on our rainy evening.

First time going to this place and I must say I was delighted. We decided to have our daughters 1st birthday dinner here cause of the amazing backyard seating they have available. We also brought a high chair in to decorate for her and the staff helped us with tape and whatever we needed to decorate and make our babies night special. Ended up ordering the hanger steak with potatoes and mushrooms with the peppercorn sauce to die for. Food was delicious. Plating was nice and neat. Service was quality. Would recommend. Thank you for having us

Came for brunch with a group of 5, and they let us wait to start the bottomless drinks until we all got there. The service was eh, seems like the waiter didn't know much English. However, the music, the food, the drinks were all amazing. Seriously, I'm having dreams about these potatoes! I will definitely be back here!

I want to put 2 stars for food (branzino and hanger stakes were delicious) and for our server who was very nice. Here is my story though. I had a reservations on Saturday night for 7 people which I made a week in advance and called twice to confirm it. When me and my husband showed up at 7 we were told by Alberto ( I might be mistaken with a name) that our table will be ready in 5 minutes so we waited for half an hour outside nobody explained us what's going on. When I went to ask if we can be seated Alberto said we can't because our party was not complete. Then I went to ask again and he got so defensive like if he was doing me a favor and really rude, he said he won't give us a table if we won't stop asking him questions. I completely understand that half of my party was late, and if they would refuse to seat us for that reason it would be fare too, but there are so many ways to explain things to customers if u call yourself a manager. He could give us a timeframe or we could start offering drinks or something. Instead I got yelled at on my birthday party by an employee. On the top of that he never apologized or even said bye when we were leaving. I've never got treated like this in the restaurant not even in a coffee shop. Unfortunately

I just held my bridal shower at Bacchus this past weekend, on Saturday. I want to extend a big, big THANK YOU to Meryl and her team for the wonderful experience my guests and I had. Everyone is still raving about how delicious the food was. The service was perfect and the staff were very accommodating for our event.
My decorator and some of my friends were able to come before the restaurant even opened to set up. Everything was perfectly timed out (with the passed hors d'oeuvres, appetizers, entrees, and dessert), even with some of my guests arriving a bit late. (I warned people about parking being tough and to even avoid driving if possible.) Someone was always checking in with me about when I want the next dish brought out, how much time to wait in between courses, when to cut the cake, etc.

I had previously been to Bacchus two years ago for a friend's wedding and loved the food and outdoor garden space.
I decided to host my bridal shower here and was so fortunate for the beautiful weather, as the garden was just the perfect area. There is a covering overhead with blinds that can be drawn down to cover from the sun. I loved the ambience of the garden space already, and my decorations looked great within it.
I opted for the 4 hours open bar including mimosas, wine, champagne, beer, coffee, tea, and soft drinks. I also pre-selected two appetizers, four entrees, and two desserts for guests to choose from. I chose to print my own menu to match the theme of my party. I was allowed to bring in my own cake and have a dessert table set up by an outside vendor.
Everything was coordinated prior to my event. I informed Meryl how many tables I would need (for guests and other displays including photo props, favors, etc.), sent over my Spotify playlist, and confirmed the menu. Everything went smoothly and the time flew by! Everyone greatly enjoyed themselves and is still talking about the wonderful party!
Once again, thank you so much!! I will definitely be back !! :)

Bacchus is a wonderful little restaurant nestled in downtown Brooklyn. The atmosphere was inviting as well as the staff. Even with several events going on, the staff was alert and attentive.

The drinks and the food were absolutely delicious! From the plating down to the very last bite- excellent!

Totally recommend and definitely coming back!

I don't think I ever had such a wonderful experience, I'm talking from the minute you walk in to the door the stuff is super friendly, they definitely make you feel welcome and that's just once you step a foot into this place , but let's talk about the restaurant as a restaurant

I know for a fact that the service in this place is by far one of the best ones I've ever had in my life and trust me I like to eat so I know more than a few places in NY but specially in Brooklyn this place doesn't get the recognition it deserves, our waiter was Fausto I think that was his name , honestly that night I didn't know what to eat and this guy gave me some options I decided to go with the octopus ragout as and appetizer and it was lovely , so obviously the waiter knew what he was talking about so I ask him for more suggestions and long history short I end up having pan seared scallops and foie grass , than I wanted to try more things because everything I had was so delightful so he suggested the venison parpadelle and my date loved it , so we ask him again and he told us their steak selection was amazing and obviously at this point we just wanted more so my date had the hanger steak and I had the rib eye steak and it was right than and there me and her decided this was going to be our place to go to for date night and by the way at their wine selection is pretty impressive I wish I knew the brand of the Sauvignon blanc or the Chardonnay because I definitely wanna have that at home

If it had the option to give them ten stars i would've done it with out a question  I wish I had more pictures but we were so busy having fun we just didn't care for our phones

As someone who loves to indulge in wine & charcuterie, Bacchus was love at first sight. The steak was absolutely amazing and their wine list is very extensive. The ambiance is really nice, but still very inviting. As someone who is relatively new to meats and cheese it was refreshing that they have a professional sommelier working there to help guide me through the menu . Overall I was very happy with my experience I will definitely be coming back

Delicious brunch place. We live in the neighborhood and decided to try this restaurant out. Service was prompt coffee was good, menu was diverse and the food was good. I got the French toast, which came with strawberries. My husband got the quiche Lorraine and the salad. They also offer a bottomless mimosa and Bellini special, which we did not partake in. Would 100% come back and bring friends. There's a lovely outdoor garden and some private rooms for larger parties.

I've known about Bacchus for years, and I finally tried it recently. Bacchus is a wine bar with a restaurant on the other side. The restaurant has a bar as well. If you like French wine this is the place to drink it, and eat good food. The wine list features many excellent wines, and they are all fairly priced. A Glass of 2015 Chateau Clos du Roy was only $15. The kitchen is solid as well. I tried the Octopus with white bean ragout as an appetizer. It was tender and tasty, but I thought that the portion was a bit small. My entree was the Rib-Eye Steak. A fourteen ounce steak that was tender and delicious, the potato's that were on the dish were delicious also. I opted for the Red Wine Shallot sauce, and it was very tasty. The negatives are:  The house bread was chewy, the Burre Blanc was tasteless, and the mushrooms included with the Steak were tough. I will go back.

Came here for the first time the other night and loved the ambiance, service, and food. The wine selection is extensive and the food was delicious. The meat plate is divine! Back again tonight for another dinner and disappointed by the music. Much too high energy pop music for such a romantic bistro setting.

Was able to book a two-person reservation here last minute on a Tuesday evening. Intimate atmosphere with dim lighting and cozy seating.

Menu is on the expensive end since it's more of a romantic dinner spot. Despite that, many of the entrees were enticing enough to order. Settled on the Atlantic Salmon ($22) and a glass of Bordeaux ($9). While waiting, got served free bread and butter to start. Bread was decent, a little tough on the outside - fine with the butter (and wine). Main course was smaller than expected; a large plate with a petite filet covering the lentils/veggies underneath. Fish is cooked well, and the horseradish sauce really brings out the flavor of the meal. Ate it all pretty fast, though wasn't stuffed afterwards.

Service here is good considering a couple large groups who took most of the attention. Like the ambiance here for dinner, though prices are considerably cheaper for lunch and brunch.

A five star review and I didn't even have any wine at this wine bistro!

I was recommended here by a friend who is a brunch enthusiast.

At first glance, the menu was disappointing because I didn't see the crab cake Benedict that was mentioned on some yelp reviews. The hostess explained to me that the menu items are rotated every few months :0

The menu may not have many options but the food and presentation were amazing. For $11, I got an impressive French toast dish called PAIN PERDU CROUSTILLANT, which is described as a Corn flakes crusted French toast with Grand Marnier Sabayon. It was huge! The bread was a soft baguette, unlike the usually thick sliced bread most places use. The sauce is a very sweet, thick custard flavored with vanilla, Marsala wine and Grand Marnier.

The waiters were very attentive and the restaurant has great ambience as well. The noise level is perfect for carrying on a conversation.

Meryl and her team are quite professional and they really helped make our wedding unforgettable.  Food was absolutely delicious -we heard all about it from the comments we received from our attendees. Our guests were of many different nationality (and sense of taste) but it seems they were all satisfied.

Meryl considered our budget and was able to understand what our vision was for our special day. On the day of the wedding, the team helped to decorate. We brought our own large photo frames and they hanged it nicely without us asking to do so.

They also provided a tripod easel to hold one of our frame for our polaroid films when we forgot to bring one. Meryl nicely sprinkled flower pedals for the ceremony at the right time.  She was of great help to the entire logistics during the ceremony.

When we had some leftover wedding cake, the team- unprompted- cut the rest and packed it up for guests to take it back home.  We thought it was a thoughtful gesture.

Compared to other venues we approached, Meryl and the rest of the Bacchus staff are super flexible and very detail oriented.  If you care about wine and food and If you want the intimate yet fun and a beautiful Brooklyn wedding, this is the perfect venue.

Needless to say, I wholeheartedly recommend dining here even without a wedding!

So I went here on a Valentine's Date with my partner. We looked at the menu online prior to the visitation so we already had an idea of what we will get and how much money we will spend. So when we got there, turns out they have a special Valentine's menu. We politely asked for their regular menu but they declined. Guess they wanted us to spend more money than planned. The lobster soup sucked, the oysters sucked, the lamb chops were the only good thing we ate. Not to mention we kept getting stared at. As if they never seen black people at a French restaurant before. So we payed $200 just to starve and be stared at. Won't be coming back here.

Bacchus checks off all boxes -- ambiance, food and service.

Ambiance: The private backyard event space at Bacchus is so dreamy and is the perfect location for a summer dinner party! Think lots of hanging string lights, greenery and lose drapes hanging from the ceiling. The ceiling is also shuttered which makes this a very versatile space. There were around 50-60 people in the group and the private event space held everyone very comfortably.

Food: Everything that I ate was damn delicious. To start, I had butternut squash ravioli. This was sweet, savory and just downright amazing. For my main I went with the half roasted chicken served with mashed potatoes and veggies. I asked for the truffle mushroom sauce on the side and am glad I did. Delicious but a little too rich for my blood. The chicken was perfectly crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Others at the table had salmon and beef and really enjoyed. Dessert was the only course that was not my favorite. I had the creme br√ªl√©e and it was a little bit overheated and watery. But... to make up for that I ate my friend's chocolate molten cake and this was insanely good.

Service: Handled the large dinner party like pros. We were joking about how no one had less than a half a glass of wine the entire night. Any time a glass looked empty the servers came around and filled the wine up to the top.

Parts of the restaurant are cozy and intimate while the backyard is great for a large party, which makes Bacchus the perfect pick for a date night or an event.

Upon entering , I was welcomed by one of the nicest staff I've across in a while. Both Sophia and Fausto were really amazing - suggested a few dishes and were very informative with the menu.Fausto poured a very tasteful glass of wine and I thoroughly enjoyed everything. Started wth French onion soup and finished with the chicken breast with mashed potatoes and asparagus.

Will definitely be returning and would love to bring the rest of the nypd crew with me sometime soon for dinner . Thank you

DELICIOUS breakfast, may look small in the photo but it was hearty and flavor packed!!  The bun was warm and had a crunch on the outside then so soft on the inside, and Perfect perfect salmon and avocado (and a LOT of them both) - no skimping!! Coffee was great as well.  Very cute spot & is doing great COVID wise with the few distanced tables and contactless experience (ordering, not reusing menus, paying, etc) .  Will def be coming back often!!  Also fun calm French music playing in the background :)

In the year 2020, going for a regular dental cleaning was considered risky business. I decided that since I was already outside, I would treat myself to some brunch after the cleaning. I'd walked by La Parisienne many times but this would be my first visit.

There was sidewalk seating plus 4 tables inside. The front door was left open so there was air circulation. As all the outdoor tables were full, I ate inside for the first time since March. I felt I had more social distance space indoors than out and I faced the open door so it felt relatively ok. They checked my temperature and had me fill out the contact tracing form. The utensil set was in a paper sleeve.

The cappuccino was made with skim milk (yay!!) and when grabbing some sugar, I noticed each table had hand sanitizer. I was surprised the egg in the croque madam wasn't nested in the bread but didn't stop me from enjoying a runny yolk. The side salad helped cut some of the oiliness.

The Yelp 10% off for checking in did work but I felt bad for using a coupon so I got a cookie to go as well. Overall the food is fine, the atmosphere was nice, and the CV19 safety checks were great.

UPDATE: I appreciate the business owners prompt response below, as well as the necessary actions they took to remedy the poor experience my friend I had at the establishment. I've updated my review to 3stars, and will update it again if we ever find ourselves giving the establishment another shot.

I came here with a friend due to the good reviews, but was so disappointed. First off, we called in advance to place an order for pickup, we were catching a ferry and in a bit of a rush. The person on the phone told us 10 minutes. We showed up in 15, and from what it appeared they only started making our food when we arrived. The place wasn't even busy, we were the only ones waiting!!! I ordered the croque madame (paid extra for avocado) and my friend got the avo toast. I also got a dirty chai latte. We tipped when we arrived ($6) so the total was just over 40.  At first I was handed an iced dirty chai (not quite what I ordered) but I shrugged it off and didn't think much of it. To make a long story short, we didn't get our food for another 20 or so minutes, missed our ferry and had to pay for an Uber, AND after all that they forgot the avocado on my croque madame (that was extra). So I overpaid, wasn't given what I ordered.

La Parisienne is a cozy gem in the neighborhood. Slightly off the tourist path where locals will meet for an unhurried and delicious sliver of Paris in the Financial District.

I think we've enjoyed just about every selection on the menu and have never been disappointed. The coffee is excellent and the wines delightful, the prices are reasonable. The service is always friendly, if you speak French you'll be right at home.

My number of check-ins doesn't come close to reflecting that we've been coming to La Parisienne for a few years now; breakfast, brunch, lunch, coffee, snacks.

There are only a few tables so some times there will be a wait, they do have a brisk take-out service and outdoor seating in season.

Glad they had indoor seating, temp checks and hand sanitizers on the table. While they were welcoming, the portions are so small for the prices! I added avocado to my brioche smoked salmon sandwich. For an extra $3 for an avocado addition.. I expected MORE than 3 small slices!! My sandwich contained small pieces of salmon, they were very cheap with the ricotta spread on the bun too. Coffee wasn't bad.

When I went I really got interested in a mushroom sandwich and it was a great decision, the really good flavors of the mushroom with the french cheese were great and the side dish salad was very fresh. Also, a great place to have a cup of coffee

Bookmarked this place when I went to Financial District with my father. Did not regret it. Small cozy French restaurant/cafe packed to the brim, and for good reasons!

La Parisienne was a very good experience, I ordered the crab cake sandwich with avocado on brioche and it great. Honestly, the highlight for me was the bun, it was fluffy and had a nice crunch! The bread makes or breaks a sandwich for me.

The menu is a little bit lighter than I would've thought, but I had 0 real complaints about this place so it gets my five! Check out the yelp check-in deal here as well.

Placed an order through Ritual for Tuesday afternoon lunch at this cozy cafe. Relatively small inside for a popular eatery, as I had to squeeze through all the busy tables to get to the pickup area in the back.

My order consisted of the Chicken Salad Brioche Sandwich ($13) as well a Turmeric Latte ($4.75). The sandwich has a seasoned chicken spread and veggies inside a toasted brioche bun. Bread tasted a bit stale, saved a little bit by the tangy-ness of the chicken salad. Turmeric latte lacked much flavor and had a grainy texture. Probably better off using whole milk rather than skim in the future.

Seems like this place is popular and the menu in extensive enough to try other items for lunch or dinner on a return trip.

The wait was very quick, outdoor seating, friendly and quick service. The food was also delicious, we got the avocado toast, French toast and the mushroom egg sandwich. The French toast was great, not too sweet and not too dry. The avo toast was alright, a bit dry.

9/4/2020Dear Laura,

Thank you for your review. We are sorry to hear (see) what happened.
This is not the way the chocolate croissant is suppose to be, something must have been done wrong during the preparation.

Our pastries are really great quality, specially the pain au chocolat, i do think it tastes even better than in France.

Again, we are really sorry about the quality that you received. Please don‚Äôt hesitate to stop by and try again, you won‚Äôt be disappointed.

We hope you will give us an other chance and maybe change the rating from 2 stars to 5 stars.

Thank you for your support.

What a cozy yet  stylish little french bakery! The decors on the walls and through out the store put one on a happy mood immediately.

We were here for afternoon coffee and snack, ended up trying the warm apple tart and the pairs-brest. The apple tart was a pleasant surprise, thin piece but was condensed with layers of apple and yumminess. Paris - brest was a bit hard on the bread, and a little cold compared to expectation, but the cream filling was still tasty.

Our server lady was very friendly and tentative. Overall grear experience.

This place is popping so you might have a bit of a wait, especially if you go on a Saturday like I did (note: definitely make use of the Yelp waitlist function), but believe me when I say it's worth it.

Like any other proper millennial, I'm a fan of avocado toast. The avocado toast here is among the best I've had in a restaurant. They happened to be out of multigrain bread, so they offered to substitute the bread with sweet potatoes. Good thing they were out of the bread because that combination, with the addition of the smoked salmon, was phenomenal. I don't usually find avocado toast particularly filling, but at La Parisienne it was a healthy, satisfying meal. I also tried a piece of my friend's croque madame, which was nothing but buttery goodness. To finish things off, I picked up a sticky bun at the pastry bar that I ate later that evening. Spoiler: it was delicious.

The best thing about La Parisienne is that the prices are more than reasonable (and a Yelp check-in gets you 10% off). And the service was fast and friendly---my water glass was never empty. The next time I visit NYC, I will definitely pay La Parisienne another visit if I happen to be in the neighborhood.

Had breakfast here this morning and I loved every single minute of my time here. Was visiting NYC and traveling alone so it was easy to get in quickly and sit a the bar. The baristo / bartender helped me with my selection as I was uncertain whether to get the avo toast or the salmon brioche. He made the best recommendation ever and suggested the avo toast with salmon on top! Mind BLOWN!

Also ordered the chia pudding which included coconut toppings and fresh fruit. Spectacularly perfect in every way.

Black coffee  to top things off made my last breakfast in NYC delightfully perfect. I cannot recommend this place enough and I can't wait to bring my family and friends here. Not a great place for big groups as this is a tiny venue. Great for one or two people, if you come during peak times you will find a line!

Check in on yelp and you could also get a 10% discount off the bill! Merci!

This is the review I did a year ago and just realized it never got posted!
My boyfriend and I wanted to find something special for our weekend brunch place. We found this one! Music is pleasant, the space is small but cozy, we sat at the bar, feels like having brunch at friend's home. We ordered the croquet sandwich, little did we know, it's not vegetarian, but we are both vegetarian. I told the hostess that we need to order something else, as it's not vegetarian, they took the sandwich away without giving us hard time or charging! Great experience.

So cute in here. I sat by the chef and the majority of the staff spoke French here. Wait time was short because I look at Yelp before I got there and saw that you can wait on a waiting list. By the time I found a parking spot and got there I got seated quickly. The line was out the door and I can understand why because the food was delicious. Staff was friendly.
I ordered the croissant with ham and cheese, also added avocado and egg to it. That was delicious. I'd live to come back here with my family and friends.

Open at 8:30am, when I came here is 9am and I waited for a while. Decoration is beautiful and cute!!
The chai latte is pretty good, the salmon is a little salty but overall is delicious. The chia pudding is the best!! Mixed with strawberry, pineapple and honey, not so sweet but suitable as a dessert or also appetizer for breakfast!

Cozy cafe! We had a charming server, spoke fluent French with my lunch buddy. I thought while in a French place I should try French Toast. So I can tell the difference between the real thing and the American version. I've already forgotten how to say French Toast in French, but the server said the literal translation was ""lost bread"", and told me a little story about how it came to be. I loves these kind of connections with the unique eateries in busy cities! Thank for the hospitality,  service, and like I said, that was the best lost bread I ever had!!!

Great breakfast place in New York, I ordered French toast and turmeric latte, both were excellent. The service was great and the place is small and busy.

Came back second day, ordered matcha latte and salmon brioche, again both were very well made, taste great and 5 stars for second round!

I don't often eat lunch in the Financial District, but one bite at this charming French restaurant  secured many return visits to the neighborhood.

An eatery so cramped, errant juice from a lemon a woman squeezed at the next table over squirted right in my eye. That's *howclose* we sat. But, I'd take that acidic unpleasantness any day if it meant I'd be eating a La Parisienne again.

The restaurant offers a weekday combo -- $12.75 for a bowl of soup, salad, & half a croque monsieur -- which I would've ordered had the soup not been cauliflower.

My Croque Forestier ($12) had mushrooms, brie, & truffle bechamel which I topped with two over-hard eggs ($2 each.) The bread was heavily buttered making each bite deliciously decadent. Yup, still thinking about that sandwich...

Super cute place!! I arrived before lunchtime so I was able be seated right away but this place gets fill very quickly. All the staff was very friendly and welcoming, also very attentive. I order sandwich matin with extra avocado and a glass of wine, was delicious. I loved the brioche! Will definitely come back and try their late menu.

My friend and I stopped at this location after passing by it multiple times and always seeing it busy. The staff made sure to follow safety procedures by taking our temperatures at the door and seating us at a table that was very much socially distanced. We ordered quite possibly the BEST hot apple cider I've ever tasted. I had the soup of the day (amazing and dairy free), alongside the Croque Forestier (Brie, mushrooms, truffle). I will be dreaming about this meal until I am able to enjoy it again. The energy in the space was light, airy, and vibey. The owner made sure to introduce himself and thank us for the support! 10/10 I cannot recommend enough - you will see us again soon!

What a cute little spot! My friends and I ended up here because we could join the waitlist for brunch online- hard thing to find in such a big city. After checking out of our Airbnb and ditching our luggage we made it to this place. It is tiny but very cutely decorated. The fresh air breeze was a nice touch as well!

Our wait was a few minutes beyond what was estimated from joining the waitlist. They were able to accommodate our large-ish (5) party for the size of the place. The menu was full of delicious sounding options. It was hard to narrow down to one thing.

I opted for the avocado toast and added an egg to get lighter fare after a weekend of gluttonous eating. The toast had a generous spread of miso hummus that was an unusual and incredibly tasty bite. The sesame seeds sprinkled on top added to the overall unique flavor. Great little spot!

WOW I finally found a hidden gem in the heart of FiDi! I was craving some brunch style food on a Sunday morning, but didn't want your typical eggs and waffles.

I can't believe I always walked by this place. The atmosphere is amazing and feels like you just got transported into a little chic cafe in Paris. The space is a little small, so it definitely gets crowded during peak hours, but you can use Yelp's live wait!

The food was PHENOMENAL. I ordered the Sandwich Matin and Brioche French Toast. First, the Sandwich Matin was delicious and the prosciutto was very fresh. The brioche buns they used were so good! It was also toasted to perfection.

Next, the Brioche French Toast was so crazy good. I really think the Brioche buns make a HUGE difference. It tasted amazing when it was drizzled with maple syrup and topped with almonds, blueberries, and bananas!

I'll be back soon for my next weekend brunch!!

I don't usually frequent FiDi but while in the neighborhood, we decided to come here for a quick brunch. Glad we did. The food is so delicious and French. The atmosphere is iconic Parisienne including contemporary French music and decor. Well priced for the portion and quality. Would come here again. Use the 10% off for checking in ;)

We had the French toast this morning. It was utterly fantastic! The main gentleman there who was a host/server was also great, too.

The espresso is good, too.

I very highly recommend this place. Definitely check it out.

Had a lovely dining experience in this adorable cafe in downtown Manhattan. Stopped in this place for a quick bite prior to checking out the 9/11 Memorial and had a delightful meal. I went with the organic quinoa salad with smoked salmon served over a bed of spinach with shaved radishes with black sesame seeds (generous portion and refreshing with Asian flavor twist!) as well as the salmon brioche (fluffy warm bread with smoked salmon with a delightful herbs cream cheese, cucumber and dill (satisfying and filling). Our waitress had a French accent (love that touch, feels like I was dining out in Paris)! Highly recommend this place.

I really like this little place and everything tastes pretty good here. The only problem I noticed is consistency in food taste. You can definitely tell the difference when you come during their busy hours from when not. Although they look the same, something is off when they are busy. It's not that exciting to have something different from what you expected after a long wait. If you want to try their great sandwiches, I recommend visiting them early.

Lovely hidden gem cafe and small restaurant in lower Manhattan! This one window cute place make you feel a bit in Europe or definitely not close to Wall Street. Decor and menu are clearly French style.

I went over for an early dinner/bite and I enjoyed happy hour rose at half price a glass, and a delicious salad with warm goat cheese, prosciutto, arugula, and sundries tomatoes.

The menu is fairly reach considering the small place. I can't wait to go back trying other small dishes, or eggs in various styles.

Cute little shop - a perfect place for breakfast or lunch! My sister and I shared the warm green bowl and ham and cheese croissant and would totally order the same combo again! The salad was very filling and freshly made and the croissant sandwich was super flavorful and rich. The rose sangria was also light and refreshing with some fresh berries! Service was friendly and efficient! Open during COVID with at least small 5 tables set up outside.

This place is so adorable, is this what Paris is like? I've always liked pastries but the delicacies are superb.  I had to make a stop before my tour at the federal reserve bank.  It was a delight to have a treat before an amazing tour!

Thank you for your accommodation.  I hope to be back in the near future.  Hope all is well with the COVID situation.

Easily one of the best Italian restaurants in NYC! I have been lucky and always able to get in without reservations. Prices for food and wine are reasonable and staff is pleasant and attentive. The back patio is completely covered - invaluable for covid dining! I was here during a rainstorm and was completely dry and comfortable.

Bruschetta is a must-order (breakfast or brunch), along with the chicken parm (either as a sandwich or with side order of pasta). Also really enjoyed the saut√©ed calamari. They have a surprisingly big menu and lots of specials every day, and pasta tastes fresh!

Note that they will take card but prefer cash for payment.

The best meal I've had since before quarantine.

I'm a picky Italian American who can cook and this places flavors blew my mind. There was a table full of us. The wine, many appetizers and pasta entrees we ordered were all delicious and so authentic. One of the best in Brooklyn.

Service was also so great.

I am so glad we chose Gersi for one of our first outdoor dining experiences. Four of us ate at their outdoor dining area on the street and we were the only people there. This made it more comfortable for us, but I wish we chose the spacious backyard instead. If you're reading this, definitely ask for the backyard space!

I had to try the spaghetti al limone - I've never heard of a dish like this before and with the hot, humid weather we've been experiencing the idea of refreshing citrus won me over. This dish did not disappoint! Every bite had a perfect mix of crisp lemon, creamy cheese, and pasta. I'm not sure if they make their pasta in-house or not, but the texture of the spaghetti was absolutely perfect with just enough chew.

My friends got the carbonera, which was also excellent, and the black linguini. I appreciate that Gersi gave bread and oil before the food came, margins are tight these days and that gesture went a long way (the bread was tasty too).

Great choice for takeout or delivery or outdoor dining. I need to come back to visit the backyard!

Shame on you Gersi. While your food is consistently delicious, you are most certainly violating Covid dining rules. Your back ""garden"" is covered in non breathable plastic coating and it covers 90% of the surface area which makes for very little ventilation. It was PACKED out there tonight, so much so that we asked to sit along the front end of the bldg on Court Street. Furthermore, there are way too many people inside the restaurant (employees, tables, passers by). Diners beware, it does not feel safe in there and in this time of huge surges in cases, I'm shocked that the business owners are not doing more to protect their employees and customer base.

I've been meaning to try Gersi for quite some time now but with their cash only policy, I placed it on the back burner. They now accept credit cards and I had the opportunity to order food to go last night.  Granted, with Phase 2 in full swing (outdoor dining), there was the option to eat on the premises, sidewalk seating or backyard patio.

We kept it simple when placing our order. As I browsed the menu, it appeared pasta dishes were dominant. They are known for their fresh pasta which was our selection for the mains after an appetizer order of Shishito Peppers.

The peppers were good but similar to others I had elsewhere. Charred and slightly salted, they were a satisfying portion.
For main, I chose the Lemon Pasta. After reading reviews about this pasta being a popular pick, I decided to go with having high expectations.
The other main was a Mint Pasta--yes, mint and unusual.

My overall impression trying Gersi for the first time was one of ambivalence. The Lemon Pasta, although flavorful was a bit bland. It was more of a lemon butter sauce and I expected more cheese to be integrated in the pasta dish but it wasn't. Some cracked pepper would have been a good addition. The Mint pasta was unique and difficult to describe since I never experienced so much mint in a pasta dish. In summary, I felt slightly let down.

Despite this experience, I am willing to give Gersi another try--perhaps dining al fresco now that restaurants are open and the weather is accommodating.

What a great find! Booked this for a birthday dinner and I'm so glad I did. We were seated in a gorgeous courtyard in the back (they also have patio seating in the front) and the staff was so accommodating even with our large party. The food was all amazing (we got a variety of bruschetta and pastas, the panzanella salad, and the roasted chicken entree) and they have great service. They used to be cash only but do take credit cards now. Highly recommend!!!

Overall:4.2/5
Food: 5/5
Service: 3/5

We came here around 7:30pm on a Saturday night. Surprisingly we were able to get a table for 2 without any wait.

The food was AWESOME. We got mezzi rigatoni ragu dinner, black linguini with calamari, roasted garlic bruschetta, and tiramisu. All of them taste amazing and we really enjoyed it.

The only 2 things we wish they can improve is:
1. No one told us this was cash only. Usually the waiter will tell us at the beginning but no one informed us. And we didn't notice any sign saying cash only at the entrance.(maybe there's one but it was not obvious)

2. The wait time for food and service(especially checkout) was long. We understand that they might be busy during dinner hour. The waiter actually saw us while passing by, but she/he didn't come to our table until around 10 min after.

My mom and I had just finished getting our nails done down the block and wanted a quick bite to eat before heading home. It was a completely random Tuesday night, but Gersi was packed.

We managed to grab two seats by the bar and placed our orders with the lovely bartender. She did everything - take orders, make drinks, settle bills - all with a smile.

We split an order of the grilled calamari, which was a fairly large portion for the price. I had the roasted chicken with mashed potatoes. Man, the entire plate was mashed potato - I loved it!! I definitely left very, very full. The chicken moist and flavorful.

Tip: Cash only, so make sure you bring some!

This place is PERFECT, with the brunch of my dreams. They have the brunch staples I love (eggs Benedict and French toast w/ berries) that are both beautiful and delicious. It was a hot day, but their outdoor seating is covered and has fans so it was a reasonable temperature + gorgeous decor. My friends and I chatted for two hours and their service was great, with lots of water refills and smiles.

Note: cash only

I hear their pasta is good too! I will definitely be back here if I'm in the area

Had a great meal here. My favorite item was the spaghetti alla limone covered with a tasty cloud of grated parmigiana reggiano. We shared the arugula, pear, Gorgonzola salad and the watermelon salad and both were excellent.

I liked that my iced tea came in a smurf glass and that the plates didn't match - made me feel at home.

Service was friendly and efficient. The tables are a bit close but was otherwise comfortable.

We came in with a large group for our friends birthday one night and had a really great time. The restaurant is pretty small but we were seated right away with our reservation. We got 2 bottles of wine and I really enjoyed the red chianti we got.

To start they bring out bread with a bean salsa which was amazing. I couldnt stop eating it. It was super garlicky and I loved it! To eat I got the kale gnocchi with a tomato and garlic cream sauce. They were absolutely delicious! I highly recommend this dish! I also tried my boyfriends black linguini with calamari and it was also delicious!

To end we got molton chocolate cakes which were delicious as well. I loved the fresh fruit it came with.

Overall, the service was fantastic and we had a wonderful time. Only think is its cash only so dont forget to stop at the atm beforehand!

I can not say enough good things about this spot! Thankfully for me, i just moved around the corner and decided to check it out on a date night with my boyfriend. The inside is super intimate. Dim lit and brick walls. Good music playing in the background. We sat at the bar since it was busy and really enjoyed our experience. The bartender served us and she was beyond attentive and helpful. For drinks we had the Rasberry Gimlet and the Italian Old Fashion. Additionally, we had the prosciutto and fruit, garlic bread, ricotta pasta, and vanilla panna cotta for dessert. Everything was delicious!! We were beyond impressed by this place. We will absolutely be back to try everything else on the menu. Additionally, they had a huge outdoor back patio seating as well.

** note, this place is cash only

This Valentine's day, my boyfriend and I decided that it was finally time to check out this Italian hot spot and booked our reservations three weeks in advance. The restaurant was jam packed! We lucked out by scoring a stand-along table in the corner by the window, but I could not help but feel sorry for the less fortunate patrons seated in a long row of tables, seemingly shoulder to shoulder.

As the complimentary bread and bean dip in olive oil came out, I was all too ready to declare my love for Gersi. That dip was delish - perfectly garlicky, light kick of spice. Yum! Next, we decided to split two entrees and forego an appetizer.

Scallops and saffron risotto: scallops were just ok - although tender and sweet, they were a bit sandy and needed to have been washed with a bit more care (no one enjoys that annoying crunch when biting down on food), and a squeeze of lemon would have improved them as well. The risotto was gummy, tough, and dry, and we ended up leaving most of it completely untouched. Huge bummer for a dish priced at $32.

Lamb ragu pappardelle: although a slight improvement from the scallop dish, this entree left much to be desired as well. Pasta was super overcooked and thus mushy, and the sauce was flat and flavorless. Not once were we asked if we needed any Parmesan or freshly ground black pepper (or anything at all, for that matter). I could not help but get Chef Boyardee flashbacks from my college days with every bite of this dish.

Unfortunately, the complimentary bread and dip was the highlight of the whole meal for us. Perhaps this was a one off night for Gersi with it being a busy Valentine's night, but I have a hard time believing that since the wait time here on any weekend night can easily exceed 45 minutes without reservations. I simply do not get what all the fuss is about. In a city like New York (or even just Brooklyn), there's much better Italian to be had.

I went with my spouse and my mother in law for a Thanksgiving dinner, for the first time we decided to do so not to cook all the typical food only for 3 people.
The place is cozy. There was a lovely Italian waiter who was very informative, attentive and kind.
The Thanksgiving menu was very nice. Very good panzanella, nice pumpkin soup, and a huge plate with turkey, stuffing, a bit undercooked Brussel sprouts, and warm (we like it hot!) but good sweet mashed potatoes.
Great pumpkin pie!
The prosecco we had as an aperitif was mediocre, the wine was nice but a bit overpriced for what it was (Rosso di Montalcino, not Brunello!).
On the whole it was was a very nice dinner, wothout being fabulous, but it worked greatl!

So today we decided to be lazy and order breakfast. I had scrambled eggs with home fries & bacon while my bf had the French toast with a side of bacon . Everything was delicious  it came with complimentary bread, beans and a side salad . The bread was nice and soft and the bean were quite tasty ... my only issue was salad . There was so much dirt and grime on the leaves  it's obvious no one has rinse them ...

I highly recommend the black linguine with calamari and the kale gnocchi with red sauce. The table bread also comes with a light lentil dip made of butter, oil, spinach, garlic, and a faint spice. Everything was delicious and the atmosphere was great for a weekend date night.

I have also been to Cafe Buon Gusto and I Sodi in the last month, both of which were fantastic, and I honestly enjoyed the Italian food and the atmosphere more at Gersi!

My brother and his girlfriend are here often, so they made a reservation for us while we were visiting. They seated us out in the back in the greenhouse area, which was perfect as the weather was great that evening.

Our kids split the spaghetti lemon and I had the seasonal papardelle. Delicious variety of veggies and super fresh pasta. Fresh and tasty throughout.

My brother got the roasted chicken and it was MASSIVE and tasty, on a bed of mashed potatoes.

Oh and we also started with the kale Caesar and that is not to be missed! If we find ourselves back in BK we will be back!

It was okay. We got a good table. Had to ask two or three times for little things... Light the candle, some pepper for the salad, stuff like that.

Panzanella salad we had was mostly kale, very little soaked bread or tomatoes.

Tagliatele was good pasta but it was supposed to have asparagus and peas... Almost no asparagus.

Waiter was nice. Good wine list. Cash only? I tried checking in on yelp but the free glass house wine is only during happy hour.

My boyfriend and I had our New Year's eve dinner here.  The space is a lot bigger than I initially thought. There's a dining areas in the front, then a secondary and more spacious dining area in the back.  We had the Burrata, Tagliatelle ala Bolognese and the Pappardelle with wild mushrooms.  The Burrata was extremely fresh and well made.  The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente.  I will definitely come back again to try the other dishes.  The food was excellent!

Gersi! You were such a treat!

Came here on a sunny Sunday afternoon with my friend. Immediately got seated in the garden, which is SO BEAUTIFUL. Seriously, even though it was insanely hot outside, the view was worth it. It is so picturesque and quiet, I forgot I was in the city.

The staff was amazing, super attentive and friendly. After all the reviews about the mushroom bruschetta and spaghetti al limone, my friend and I made sure to order them. And they did not disappoint. The bruschetta is seriously some of the best I've ever had. The pasta dish was so simple yet so delicious. Portions were really reasonable as were the prices!

I am definitely coming back to try other pastas, but dude, I know i'm getting the bruschetta every time. Thank you for such a wonderful afternoon!!

Went back for dinner tonight and it exceeded our expectations. We had the pork chop in a delectable sauce with saut√©ed broccoli. It was simple yet outstanding. My mom had the roast chicken with mashed potatoes and she said it was the best roast chicken she's ever had. A huge shout out to Claudia, who was superb, and went above and beyond to ensure we were happy and very comfortable.  Phenomenal food and service from Claudia and the staff.  Love this place!

Had the most delightful brunch here yesterday. They start you off with their delicious bread and some type of beans. I think it was chickpeas but it had a nice kick to it.  My mom thoroughly enjoyed her scrambled eggs with potatoes and bacon and my eggs Benedict with house cured salmon was the very best I've had in a very very long time. Oh and the coffee is stellar!  The excellent food combined with the super friendly service makes this a fantastic find. Can't wait to return to try their dinner.

When I first visited this place I sincerely never thought I'd become so obsessed. But alas here we are two weeks in and I've been here more times than I can count.

They also have me hooked on Italian and this is the farthest period I've gone being obsessed almost exclusively with Italian food. I'd recommend this place to anyone who's a lover of good food and a nice peaceful environment to enjoy it in.

I've been coming to Gersi for over a year now. It's my best friend and I's ""spot"". Everything about this place is amazing. The atmosphere. The staff. The food. It's divine.

My go-to dish is the Limone pasta. The tangy lemon mixed with the creamy Parmesan is a taste experience like no other.

If you're someone who loves small indulgences, finish off with an affogato. You will not be disappointed.

The pork chops, broccoli rab, and the garlic bruschetta were amazing! The service was so good - Claudia was an absolute sweetheart. I would definitely come back!

I have to say, the tagliatelle was ok but I'm eager to come back and try the cacio e pepe.

In a historically Italian neighborhood packed with pasta joints, this relative newcomer just might be my favorite.

I can't help but liken it to Supper in the East Village (this is high praise if you had any idea how many times I've eaten at Supper). I don't know if the two places are related, but I lived down the street from that staple of the neighborhood for many years, and Gersi evokes the same comfortable feel. Here they also start you off with excellent bread and a white bean dip; the rustic decor, personable service, and quality across the entire menu just keep the similarities rolling.

Like all the best Italian spots, the specials menu often outshines the staples. Off of either list though, we haven't had a bad pasta yet. From simple dishes like the Spaghetti Al Limone to meatier fare such as the orecchiette or tagliatelle, all have been executed well. I'm looking forward to trying the lasagna for the first time.

If for some inexplicable reason you don't want pasta, I'd suggest you make a tasty meal of the simple grilled branzino, greens, and well-roasted brussels sprouts. If you don't like my suggestions, you can take a page from my wife's book and directly disobey me by getting the seemingly boring beet ravioli (I guess that's also pasta). Obviously, it was fantastic, adding one more entry to the long list of times I was embarrassingly wrong.

On the negative side of Gersi, I can't lie to you (we're too close for that): the lighting is too romantic for good food photos, and there WAS a slight mix up with the tables that caused us to get our food about 45 seconds later than we could've. But since I'm not a complete asshole, I'm going to go ahead and say that didn't matter.

I think I'm going to come in here a lot.

Cash only.

Gathered 15 of my friends here for a garden seated birthday dinner! The staff is very accommodating and reserved the back garden area for our group. a great spot for special events, large and small parties. Highlights were

We are family style and tried the black kale salads, tagliatelle bolognese, rigatoni ragu, cacio e Pepe, orecchiette, a squid pasta and mussels. Highlights were the tagliatelle and squid pasta!

Cash only is my only gripe, especially for larger groups.

What an amazing place! All I can think of was why I didn't come here sooner! I came here on Friday evening with making reservations prior. From the food to the drinks to the music to the ambiance to the service, everything was absolutely amazing! Shout out to CAMRAN for being such an amazing waitress! She definitely made our experience better! The DJ played great music through out the night including throwbacks with Spanish, reggae, hip hop & r n b. It's a vibe out here.

The drinks were made to perfection & looked so cute in the fruits! But I can't pick which food I liked more since they were all delicious & flavorful in their own ways! Worth every bite and sip!

OMG! Where do I start,my bff and I went to Kimoto for lunch and from the door to the restaurant  everyone was delightfully polite. Once inside the decor and staff was so welcoming, but I MUST give a HUGE shout out to Ryan the manager at Kimoto and Saira our server. What can I say Ryan stopped by our table to make sure we were comfortable,chat with us for awhile, spoke about the restaurant and you can feel the joy that he have working there which also reflect upon Saira, she was so attentive making sure we were not lacking anything.

Upon leaving we met a security guard omg polite and now I feel so bad I did not get a chance to ask him his name.

The food and drink sooo delicious

Overall superb staff, experience, food and ambiance. This restaurant has now become my to go restaurant and everyone I meet I make sure I tell them to go go go

KUDOS Ryan for doing such an EXTRAORDINARY job. I applaud you and your staff

Yeah, so, let's talk about Kimoto, and I hope the owners see this review and really take to heart how they can improve.

Me and my wife went for the first (and probably last) time the other night, and well. I guess I was under the impression it was more of a restaurant rather than a club. Honestly, I'm still not sure which one it is. We got pat down upon entry (like a club), the DJ was bumpin' 2000s hip hop (like a club), had a dress code and 21+ policy (like a club), but they served food and prohibited dancing (like a restaurant). It was very disjointed. That said, the decoration is cute, and the skyline views are adequate. The hosting and waitstaff are also remarkable, and I wouldn't change a thing there.

But let's talk about cost! We had to pay a $10/pp cover for our reservation, which a little ridiculous, and the food and cocktails were all heavily overpriced. They were above-average in quality, and if you are so flush with money, maybe spending $100 on two cocktails and two small appetizers may not be a big deal. Maybe that's their intended clientele. Cocktails ranged $17-$23, appetizers were $8-$15, and bigger plates were $20-$30. They also have hookah, which looked pretty tasty and quality (for like $40? though?) so this may be a decent spot for a hookah night. In addition to this, though, we were greeted with a ""20% service charge"" at the end of the meal. I assume (hope) this is an auto-gratuity that goes to our waitress (who was awesome), because it's VERY cheeky to request a tip on TOP of that. Like I said; we had two cocktails and two appetizers, did not leave any additional tip, and our little adventure cost over $100, which is an absurd cost.

Overall, my advice for the management, if you're trying to be a restaurant and not just a ""club with food"" or whatever:
* Keep your waitstaff. They are excellent. Very friendly and great service.
* Phrase ""tip"" as ""add'tl tip"", if the 20% service charge is indeed an automatic gratuity. Otherwise, eliminate that service charge, that's ridiculous.
* Eliminate the $10/pp cover. Get rid of the pat down. Lower the music volume just slightly.

This is an overrated venue. I've heard such great things about this establishment, however, upon my arrival on Labor Day itself I was highly disappointed. We were a party of 3 and were told at the entrance that bottle service was mandatory. Once we refused, we were ushered to a section near the dance floor (which was completely closed).

We were given menus and decided to order food, drinks, and hookah. The calamari was phenomenal along with the coconut shrimp. The hookah was strong and lasted for a long period of time (free refills). Despite my expectations, overall we did have a good time but this is not a place that I would come to regularly.

Disclaimer up front.  Do not come here if Marijuana is not your thing.

Always wanted to try Kimoto Rooftop.  Beautiful place, good service, average food.

So we went here with the expectation of it being a very business casual location.  Just look at the dress code.  When we got there, we were patted down for weapons?  Ok, not a big deal, it is an exposed rooftop so I understand the security measure.

So as we were seated, I noticed other groups were wearing sneakers, jeans, windbreakers, everything the dress code said not to wear.  Alright, I guess the rule didn't apply to them.

We ordered the Takoyaki, Fried Makarel, Chicken Slider, and Pretzel.

The Pretzel was the best dish.  Soft, a little too much salt in some spots, but came with dipping cheese and guac on the side.  Very tasty.

The Chicken sliders were underwhelming. Two small triangles of chicken in a small roll with greens and a dollop of guacamole.  It was dissappointingly dry.

The Takoyaki was not bad. The octopus was chewy and the batter was cooked well, although it tasted a little old.

The Fried Makarel was dry and salty.  The flavor was there, but I expected a moister fish, it tasted as if they rehydrated a dried piece of makarel, breaded and fried it.

The evening ended with one of our neighbors enjoying hookah, which was a nice aroma...  Until the other neighbors at a different setting decided to blaze.  Nothing like the pungent skunk odor and contradicting the dresscode to exemplify everything Kimoto Rooftop stands for.  Dried old fish pretending to be the catch of the day.

Came here for Valentine's day again. And again they had awesome music ranging from hip hop to smooth R&B to Frank Sinatra. My only suggestion for the music is to not play all the same type of song in a row but to mix it up. Like put the Frank Sinatra in between the R&B songs. Because at one point it was just getting to be too much of the same thing.

And again loved the decorations. Hearts and pink and red everywhere. But they had cheap balloons or something because the balloons by our table kept popping very loudly. Very distracting.

Unfortunately the food took 45 minutes. We sat down at 615 and didn't get our food until 715. Waitress apologized and gave us free shots of tequila. But I don't do shots so I didn't drink it. A price off the bill would have been better...

So deducting a star for the long wait plus the increase in prices!! Most things increased from 1 to 3 dollars since last year. The harujuku roll was 14 dollars last year and this year 17. And it didn't taste as good. It was super spicy which wasn't how it used to be. It has a spicy mayo on it in addition to the spicy tuna which is not what it specifies on the menu. Also they removed the Ice Water cocktail which I loved. We got the happy endings cocktail which was okay. They used cheap barefoot champagne in it. We had the bbq chicken sliders again which again were very good with not much meat on each. And we tried the caribbean roll which i liked best! Loved the shrimp tempura in it.

Also we didn't get to sit in the cool ""lounge"" area with the couches. I guess they just renamed that area the lounge. When my boyfriend went to reserve dinner he had an option for dinner or lounge. So of course he chose dinner. So bad word choice on the website. You can still get dinner in the lounge. And I suggest you book that. Its much more of a cool chill space. And has more greenery as well. The dinner section was right by the elevators and has cramped 12 tables In a 10 by 10 area.

Another reason this is losing a star is because we tried to come here with a group for dinner on a Sunday night and they were charging a 10 dollar cover and blasting club music! Its a Sunday night! I wanted a nice dinner with 6 people who we work with who were in town and so we went somewhere else. We couldn't even hear ourselves think. We expected that environment on a friday or Saturday but not a Sunday. They lost our business that night.

I think we will come back here next year for Valentine's though. Since the ambiance is great and I do love the music and food. Wish though the prices were the same as last year. And we will make sure we book the lounge next time!

Me and my boyfriend came here for two Valentine's Days. This year and last. I love what this restaurant did this Valentine's 2019. They made it really swanky with couches. Had red and pink heart decorations everywhere (but didn't over do it) and they had the best Valentine's day playlist. Everything from Frank Sinatra to R & B to 2000s pop. Such a great atmosphere.

Service is nice and attentive. Hostess is great. Told her we wanted to take pictures and she brought us outside in the freezing cold when she had a bare midriff top on and took the most georgeos pictures of us. Really made our night feel special.

We ordered the BBQ chicken sliders. The flavor was amazing. It hit my mouth with so much robust unique flavor. Not just pure BBQ but there was something else there. Though the amount of chicken is not even an ounce on each one. The amount of chicken is so small. Please put more chicken on so it fills the bun!

We had the rock shrimp appetizer which was good but for 16 dollars they should give more than 7 little popcorn shrimp.

Drinks were delicious. All the cocktails where great, loved the 'Ice Water' cocktsil. It has aloe in it which makes it taste so fresh and refreshing. And not overly sweet.

The sushi was great, we ordered the harajuku roll which was delicious (8 maki). Fresh mango and salmon. And only 14 dollars. Cheaper and more filling than the rock shrimp.

I will come back again next year for Valentine's. Please stick with that playlist and atmosphere. But put more chicken on those sliders!

Overall, this was a good experience. Reservations are required and there is a strict dress code but at least you know you'll have a table and be comfortable. We had 6 people in our party but our table was a little small for the party. It's more of a lounge setup too.. so the height of the table isn't necessarily conducive to eating. The food was good but not spectacular, so we definitely tried to get our money's worth by drinking as much unlimited mimosas as possible. The staff was attentive and got us new pitchers upon request.

Came here for my anniversary, it was the worse experience ever. My waitress and hostess is rude and no good customer skills. Next we notice Friday is cheaper and if you book online they charging you $300 to reserve . Then they put us at a small table, where I hit my damn shoulder because of the shelf on the wall and have the nerve to bring a small table beside us for hookah but I decline . Nobody was 6ft apart everybody was close to each other . There was no  social distancing and I have videos . It was more than 25% capacity and the ambiance isn't all that trust me . My husband got food poisoning and was vomiting for 3 hrs straight . Basically this spot was a waste of money and I will never do anything here again. Wasn't worth the money and will not recommend this place to anyone . Oh yeah , let's not forget all the ganja smoking that we started smelling smh.

Kimoto was a great experience.  At a premium price you can get an amazing view of Brooklyn, food and drinks all in one place.  My girlfriend and I enjoyed the sangria as well as the dumpling appetizer and a noodle dish.  We would recommend this for anyone looking for a celebration or a fancier meal!

Wonderful atmosphere. We had wine and took in the view.  Very nice vibe.  A bit expensive but its a rooftop in Brooklyn.

I definitely will return on a weekend night.

Came here on a Thursday night with my friends. We called in advance and were sent a picture of our seating. When we arrived we were instead sat at two bar tables which were not very comfortable. The music was too loud to have a conversation. If you are looking for more of a club this would probably work. But not for a dinner. It also did not feel safe with tables close together and some of the staff not wearing masks. We mostly ordered appetizers to share. The food was fine. There is also a 10$ cover fee.

I came here for brunch to celebrate a friends birthday. We had reservations for 3:30pm and did not get seated until 5pm. So What was the point of the reservation!? We were seated in area and one of the girls in our party had to sit on a ""stool"" that looked more like an end table. The area in which we were seated did not comfortable seat the amount of people in my party but that's besides the point. After asking to speak to the manager to express how upset we were about the wait we were given two rounds of shots. Not like a shot in a glass shot glass but the little plastic shot glasses. It was free so I can't complain much but still. Being that we were seated at 5pm we couldn't order from the brunch menu which is what we had our hearts set on. Upon being seated they left us plates and utensils but didn't give us glasses for water (which was brought to us) until we requested them.

Moving on to the food: I had the chicken Alfredo which was very subpar. The chicken was unseasoned and dry

Moving on to the drinks: they have a DIY mimosa bar during brunch hours. As it got closer to brunch ending they did not replenish supplies which is a bit disappointing, you should keep the area stocked until the brunch time ends. So you make your own mimosa and they have sangria there as well. In order for me to make my own mimosa I do need a glass, my friend had to request a glass at the bar because they didn't have any by the mimosa station. I do like the idea of make your own mimosa however, there should be someone there monitoring if there is enough juice and glasses at all times so they can keep it stocked up. I had a rum punch which was very weak. My friend had a drink called ""pop in the name of love"" it came in a champagne flute and was hot. Not warm but hot. Who wants to drink a hot beverage?

Parking: there's about 2-3 parking garages within the vicinity that are about 2-4 blocks away.

Atmosphere: the view of the city is beautiful! The actual interior was okay. The couches are pretty low so if you're tall, you have a looooonggggg way down.

Overall 2/5 stars. Not too sure if I'd come back though.

This rooftop owes me a $150 refund and has been ducking my attempts to get in touch. I was came to the rooftop on Saturday September 5 for a sushi dinner. The website advertises sushi dinner. Before arriving, I had to make a $150 payment to reserve my table for 2 people. However, bc of Covid the rooftop no longer offers sushi. Makes sense, but there was no way of a patron like me to know that beforehand. I decided to leave the rooftop in search of sushi. A young lady downstairs said I'd be refunded my $150 payment, but it's been over a week and still no refund. (Also the rooftop was really loud, should lower the music).

Bought tickets for a Fever open bar event and came here to find bartenders unaware of what's going on. The event was from 6-8pm but the bartender thought the open bar ended at 7 so they wouldn't give me drinks until they've spoken with the manager.

Venue. It's a rooftop bar with obstructed views from new developments nearby. It's still a good location for a rooftop bar nonetheless. I liked the ambiance, they were playing reggae and souka and I would have loved for the place to turn into a dance floor.

Food. Food was surprisingly good. My favorite was the yellowfin tuna. Next favorite was the truffle fries that came with a variety of dips. We ordered around 8 appetizers - split among 3 girls we paid $36 each including service charge. For the amount of food we had, it wasn't bad at all.

Service. I was turned off by the bartenders and how clueless they seemed to be. It was also weird that the waitress couldn't bring us drinks to our table. Besides that, the waitress was very attentive and so were the servers. They cleared our table when we needed more space and was available when we needed something.

Crowd. The crowd was a little odd. We were told that we can only keep our table until 8 because they have reservations but at 8pm on a Friday night it was hardly crowded. This place seems to be an Instagram spot for influencers because one of the tables next to us did nothing but took turns taking pictures all night. The table across us also mistakenly exchanged my drink with hers - good thing we still had the open bar so I was able to replace my drink.

It was an entertaining experience though this is probably not the spot i would hang out in. Love the music and ambiance but this place needs a lot of improvement on service.

This place is simply OK. I would return and try it again for a date, possibly or as a smaller group but as a large party, not worth it. We got there on a Saturday evening around 7pm for a friend's birthday. When booking, we were told there doesn't have to be a table minimum as long as everyone is ordering drinks and hookah but later on, it changed to ""must get bottle service"". Okay cool, bottle service it is! Paid around $700 for 2 medium bottles (tequila + jack). You'd think the service would be impeccable but the servers seemed impatient to constantly clear the table and they took 2 drinks that still had alcohol in them. We also went to the bar and ordered extra drinks and the bartender had a nasty attitude ""what do you want, hurry up"" like, can I have 5 seconds to glance at the menu? They're also served in plastic cups with a price tag of $14.

We also got some fries and calamari, and 3 hookahs. The hookahs were your basic flavors but lasted pretty long and the coal changer (Farhan) was very nice to us and came around often. The hookah quality was better than I expected. The fries and calamari were both delicious but portions seemed on the smaller side.

Make sure to use the bathroom before you get here cus the lines get hectic! The atmosphere is nice and the decor is beautiful. We left with a bill of around $1000 and while there were certain shortcomings, I'd possibly come back to try it again

This spot is a fabulous place to sit at the bar, take in the extraordinary view, and hear some loud, lively music. It's a scene filled with action and energy. The food is only fair and quite disappointing. If you have enough of the tasty drinks, you won't notice, yet with the NYC prices, I expected better quality. The gyoza dumplings were terribly over cooked. I expected a dough that was soft and firm, not deep fried and crispy. The crispy rice sushi did not have sushi rice. The spicy tuna was served on what could have been rice cakes. The texture of both dishes were severe enough that I feared cracking a tooth! The jalape√±o was a nice touch on the sushi, but the sauce provided was insufficient to use for the whole dish, and getting the attention of the waitstaff was a lengthy process.  Final assesment: go for the bar, dancing, and view. Eat somewhere else before you g

Let's be real. Decor is gorgeous.

For a hotel rooftop restaurant I am really impressed at the layout of the space and the overall aesthetics. The seating is broken down into lounge and table seating we close lounge because of the people watching capacity. Just kidding. But really the lounge seating is very comfortable.
There are vines and strings of lights and paper lanterns that give a relaxed nature vibe. Really beautiful.

Food. We ordered the Truffle Parm Fries, Spicy Tuna Pizza, Crab Rangoon and the Seaweed Salad. All tasted good. The presentation was pleasing to the eye. The best of the four was a tie between the Rangoon which had a heavy celery presence that I liked and the spicy tuna pizza because who doesn't like spicy tuna.  I think the price point is dancing along the verge of overpriced however I can see for being a hotel restaurant and a rooftop where the pricing is coming from. The happy hour before 7 for margaritas was great. $6 each!

Overall it was a lovely experience. I would probably try another rooftop next time but it is def a great date or chill happy hour spot if you are in the area!

Horrible experience. I was turned away because my shoes did not have a back piece which does not adhere to the dress code which I understood was my mistake. I was completely okay with not being let in but as soon as I requested a refund I was told to stand to the side while they ask the manager for a refund. After waiting 20 mins the manager did not come down to talk to me and simply stated to cancel my reservation online to reverse the charge. I did exactly that and now days later still no refund. I am not being told that I have to email someone to get my refund of $200.
This is an extremely unprofessional establishment that wants to change its image to being more upscale however the staff itself is unprofessional and changing the dress code isn't going to disguise that.
If they are so quick to turn people away why aren't they willingly to give refunds?

I must first say the food is amazing!

I love their variety and being in a mix group of friends of meat eaters and vegetarians we all had many options.

However its disappointing that when reserving a table they make you pay 10.00 for each person. If you arrive after a certain time and they are having rooftop you might end up paying extra...up 20bucks for men.

After booking a table for three we were seated in a small side table setting with no room for sitting or eating comfortably. I think if someone pays for a table they should give a decent table not squeezed make shift seating. Esp since gratuity added into check and the food will be pricey for some.

Again if the seating arrangements were better I'd def give them a 5star rating.

Celebrated a friends birthday here and loved my experience. The venue is  absolutely beautiful and on a weekday completely empty, we literally had the entire rooftop to ourselves. The food was delicious, I enjoyed the Heavenly coco roll and the mermaid roll both were recommended by the server and definitely a must try.The drinks were great, I had The Brooklyn bridge, it's served in a  pineapple shell, it definitely made a great photo op. The staff here were awesome, the manager came over and gave the birthday boy a celebratory shot with sparklers definitely made an amazing memorable experience .

Won't be coming back. Was advertised as outdoor seating but instead was put in a plastic pod with another couple even though I had a reservation. Staff wore no masks. Bouncer aggressively patted me down before we went inside. Not safe or accommodating for Covid. Walked out after 5 minutes.

The best thing about going about this place is the rooftop view.

I stayed at the Aloft hotel and really wanted to check this place out and try the food as there wasn't a lot of food spots that stayed open late in the area. We tried to come up for food on a Saturday night and were told we had to pay just to get in for some food. Mind you, this is the only restaurant option in the hotel.

We tried to come again during the week to check it out. It's an ok place but between the prices and less than enthusiastic vibe from the wait staff,  it was just ok.

The atmosphere and view of the rooftop is amazing. I gave it three stars because the service and food were both mediocre. They took a while to seat us and the waitress took forever to take our order. We ordered the calamari and crab cakes and both arrived without sauce. Then we ordered the shrimp fried rice and it lacked seasoning and flavor. It started raining so we asked to be seated inside and the manager told us NO but then said we can sit inside if we carry the outdoor furniture in ourselves. I wasn't impressed and I'm not sure if I would visit again.

So much potential... very disappointing.

Don't waste your time eating here. Food was like it came from a mall food court. Which is ironic because the City Pointe at Fulton Mall is a phenomenal food experience and just a couple blocks away. Save yourself the disappointment and head there instead.

Didn't have drinks. Maybe they are fantastic

I came here for dinner and drinks because my friend recommended it after she went on a date here.

Views? . Food? . Drinks?

The food was pretty good. I got the Jap chae and one of the sushi rolls which was pretty good. I'd give both a 8/10.

The cocktails really won be over because I felt that they were so creative (I got some lychee one).

My friends and I also ordered a huge Moscow mule, which seemed watered down but that's what expected at bars these days (shrugs)

The service was also amazing and so accommodating. We got seated indoors first, but we wanted to sit outside on the roof so they moved us :) our waitress was also super sweet and amazing (I forgot her name but she had cool tats :) )

Went here during a weekday during the day with my boyfriend. It was very calm and I really liked the rooftop decor. The space was very open and clean.

I ordered the shrimp teriyaki, which tasted very fresh and the broccoli could've been steamed much longer. The service was fine though. I would like to return at night to have a feel of their nightlife.

i wish i could give this place 3.5 stars. Kimono was a beautiful restaurant with a view of the statue of liberty and the food that we had was really good.  i'm a picky eater when it comes to asian fusion but there were many things that i wanted to try. i was very impressed with the crab cakes and a decent happy hour, that changes daily.... we also got a very fresh mango chicken teriyaki salad and teriyaki shrimp, which were also delicious.

for drinks, the strawberry margarita was super fresh and only $8 on happy hour.

however,we started with a $14 drink called the elite which was made of ciroc apple, prosseco, apple picker and supposed to come with kiwi boba balls... instead they were out at the bar of the boba balls and our waitress failed to tell us that or even apologize to ask if we'd like something different until we asked her where they were... that was very awkward, because we ordered that particular drink because the boba balls were a unique touch. with out, it was just a sugary acid green drink that made everything sticky.

we were also in part of the roof where they had these clear tent like dividers that made the place like a sauna since no breeze could get through. we were so hot, and there was a fan pointing inside, so we asked if she could bring it out here, cuz we were in direct sun with no air, and she said it had to stay inside, though it was 5 feet away. another waiter moved it out to us and we were grateful for him.

another weird thing was the hostess kept coming to take our menu... like normally at a lounge, they leave a drink menu to make it easy to make your next drink decision. we were there to lounge, and order food as we pleased, but it was awkward cuz the hostesses came by asking to take first the food then the drink menu. get your hostesses some more menus... it wasn't so busy, that they should be running out

I went yesterday for brunch and I must say I enjoyed myself. The energy and the ambiance is different yet refreshing.  The menu is very limited or brunch I think it's like 5 items but the avacado toast was AMAZING!!! The 1.5 unlimited drinks must have started once we sat down and actually was able to place our orders but it was a decent spot. I definitely have to try it after 4 when the menu is different but I'll definitely be back. Limited menu with good food and a good scenery is a perfect way to brunch. Minus the cold coffee waiting forever for a waitress and unlimited drinks which only felt like an hour I enjoyed myself

The music was great! I loved the ambiance. The soy garlic wings were good. The manager came to our table to check if everything was okay and provided us with a charger when our phones died. If you like hookah, they have that available as well. I highly recommend.

I came to this establishment under a different name years ago. I remember being nervous because they had only one elevator taking you to the rooftop and I felt trapped. When I was invited here by friends, I was skeptical but I obliged.  Glad I did. The main hotel elevators now all guests to go to the rooftop. The ambience was incredible. We sat in a booth-like area while sipping drink, nibbling on appetizers and smoking hooka. The DJ kept the music flowing. I came directly after work so it was a calm setting, but by the time we left around 9 pm, it was evident the vibe was turning party-ish.  Glad I got out when I did. Lol

This place is a few short blocks from work, so I'll definitely return for some summer night excursions.

Definitely a good turn up spot Monday through Thursday mid day until night time. Came on a Thursday night. Hookah is a must the mint flavor was phenomenal and the drinks you can't go bad with. It get really pack on a Thursday night so try to go early to get a good view and hold your spot.

Cute chill spot. The scenery is beautiful. I like the appetizers rather than the entree. I ordered the crab fried rice, which didn't have much taste to it. Their chicken salad and Korean bbq wings are good.

This is my 1st time coming here since this rooftop was renovated. Definitely enjoyed everything about this restaurant as I came here for a friends birthday. Went on a Saturday night as they had a live DJ, and hookah, to go along with signature drinks. Even with a party going on, there was still another part of the restaurant made for people who choose to dine in. The great view of downtown BK while on the rooftop is also a plus that adds to the experience of the place. I would recommend this place and I definitely will be coming back.

It was a very nice outdoor setting.
But our waitress was MIA most of the time barely checked on us to see how we were doing nor ask how was the food where it arrived.
Decent price, the drinks was the best part

I made a reservation here before reading any reviews. I am not a seafood/sushi eater but my partner is. Going over the menu I saw this place had the best of both worlds. A lot of reviews mention poor service. I wouldn't say I agree just because it is a lounge, not a place that is trying to move tables quickly. With that being said, don't expect to be in and out of here. I got the alfrado, it was okay I wasn't expecting much being that this is a sushi place. My partner got two rolls, one with cooked shrimp and another with raw salmon and tuna. The salmon in his roll was bad, he couldn't eat it and we had to send it back. They were nice and took it off the check no problem.

Other then that, it is a nice spot, strong drinks and reservations are almost always needed to get a spot!

Cool spot... has a nice view.

Tried one of their cocktails with Hennessy and pear puree -- it was really nice the first time around, but not as good the second time. Not a fan of inconsistent cocktails, but the bar was crowded so the bartender was moving really quickly to tend to folks.

Had the cheese flatbread... it was really just a cheese pizza. It was good, but nothing to write home about. Can't really go wrong with cheese on bread.

Ladies at coat check were really nice. Bartender was neutral -- again, busy and seemed to just be trying to get his job done.

Would go back again if I'm in the area, but wouldn't be my first choice.

Look no further for an amazing pasta dish, cocktail, or oversized soup when you're visiting the Dumbo area. Just around the corner from the ""it"" spot for that photo you want to take under the bridge, and there's outdoors seating right now during the fall (great perk for a beautiful autumn day). I had the butternut squash soup, which could be a meal on its own bc it's a big bowl! Nutmeg and cloves highlight the dish and make it a seasonal delight. The whipped ricotta was good, with honey drizzled over it and a walnut topping it, but it wasn't anything to write home about.
The pasta dishes were amazing! I had the pumpkin caramelle which were cute ribbon raviolis in a gentle butter and sage sauce. light and delightful! my friend has the penne in a pink sauce with sausage crumbles and that one was fantastic! highly recommend; doesn't seem like you could go wrong here.

Lovely ambience with a rustic vibe right in the heart of Dumbo. The food was just mediocre. Instagram worthy, but lacking some dimension.

The egg in a cloud was cool to look at, but you realize that eating a large volume of fluffy egg whites doesn't do much for you. I appreciate the cheese and spinach beneath, but felt this dish could use another component.

The eggs purgatory had a pretty plain tomato base, the bread was good, but the kale on the side seemed like an afterthought.

For about $14 per dish, I was not full whatsoever and nothing seemed to stand out. It was just ok.

We ordered the Nutella Panino and this was also disappointing. Everything seemed too soft and I felt the bread could have been toasted to create contrast between the already soft Nutella.

Again, maybe this is too critical but for New York City, I think you can get better tasting breakfast at this price point!

PSA: Pay with CASH. If you pay with card they charge you an extra 4% fee.

TL;DR: Affordable brunch place in dumbo. Super cute aesthetic. Seems they're most known for is their Egg Cloud dish. Brunch prices for entrees were between $12 and $15 which isn't bad.

Took some out of town friends here because we were looking to eat brunch not too far from the Brooklyn bridge. It's a super cute Italian place about a 5 min walk from the bridge walking entrance and you can get a pretty clear picture of the Manhattan bridge from the street perpendicular to the restaurant.

We got here at 11 am on a Sunday and were able to be seated without reservations. The hostess did look pretty concerned when we said we didn't have a reservation so I'd recommend making one unless you'll coming as soon as the restaurant opens. There's a good amount of seating inside and some at the bar. It was pretty busy already and our food took some time to come out. The whole restaurant was decorated for Halloween which I thought was pretty cute! Prices weren't that bad either for brunch, most brunch items were between $12 and $15 for entrees.

For apps, we got the tomato bruschetta which I thought was okay. Didn't blow my mind but was still very tasty and everything was fresh.

For meals, all 3 of us were super basic and got the egg in the cloud. It's fluffed egg whites topped with the egg yolk sitting on top. The egg sits on top of super crispy brioche with ham and cheese and the whole thing is surrounded by cooked spinach. I was worried the egg whites would taste weird but it was very airy and light.

I'd definitely come back if I'm in the Dumbo area!

Good brunch place. A quick walk from the Cliffs at Dumbo if you're looking for a good place to eat after bouldering. At around Sunday 1:40pm, we arrived and there was a 20 min wait to get seated.

I got the smoked salmon panini which taste very good and was healthy.

The atmosphere is chill with plenty of seats. Even when it was fully seated, conversation was easily made and heard.

Note that there is a 4percent upcharge from the prices that you see on the menu if you pay with credit card!

I'm giving 5 star for my breakfast experience. Food was sooo delicious. All the flavors mixed are just perfect. If you're around the area,
Service was fast and waiter very nice.
If you're around for breakfast, this is the place to go to.
However, during lunch their menu is not so great. It is a complete different experience.

The hanger steak is some of the best steak I've ever had. Is it a little pricey, yes. $38 for hanger steak and salad is probably $6-8 too much but boy it's damn good. The rest of the food/place is really nice. Wet right under Manhattan bridge you get a true NY experience in a date night style restaurant. Food has been really good every time we've been, nothing has really disappointed. I would highly recommend if on a date or just wanting a great meal. I never hear this place mentioned amongst the best restaurants but it's a low key gem.

Great brunch in Brooklyn near the waterfront.  The wife and I spent a day in Brooklyn and it started at AlMar.  My wife had the frittantina.  It was like an omelet that hadn't been flipped.  It was very tasty, and made me immediately think I have to up my asparagus game at home.  I had the AlMar sandwich with egg, bacon, avocado, etc.  It was really tasty too.  I enjoyed it being served with a salad.

At some point during my wife's comparison shopping between the fifth and sixth iteration of leather chairs, it struck me: I was famished and I wasn't going to make it much longer.

Not wanting to die on the showroom floor, I lifted myself off of the saddle leather Mid-Century Show Wood chair (pass -- not much back support above the shoulder blades) ... and dragged myself into AlMar which sat a block away.

The ambiance was rustic and natural and the brunch menu looked just as inviting. I came, I caffeinated, I conquered.

I really enjoyed the food I ordered: Cheese bread topped with two eggs, truffle oil and a side of asparagus. I also ordered a side of potatoes, and since we had eleven more chairs to compare, I treated myself to the Nutella panini.

An egg in the cloud is a must-try in Dumbo. It's definitely unique and can't get this anywhere else. Egg white is made into a foam like merengue and half done york is dropped right in the middle. The cloud itself didn't have much taste but I liked how the whole dish wasn't salty at all. And the toast! It was crunchy outside, soft inside and went really well with the cloud on top. And they give so much spinach with it and they are perfect. We did order egg toast too and it was almost the same as the egg on the cloud as the toast was exactly the same and the only difference between the two was the cloud, ham and the truffle oil. I think next time I come, I'll order pasta as it is an italian restaurant.

The restaurant is beautifully decorated with open windows, big screen projector playing on the side with a bar on the other side. They have a lot of plants in the restaurant which brings lovely vibe to it. Also, the receiptionist and the wait staff are really friendly and really welcome the patrons.

Brunching at AlMar is one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had in New York. And one of the first things to note about this place is that they charge an additional 4% on any bills paid with a credit card (instead of cash) plus an ""encouraged-by-the-owner"" 20% tip is automatically tacked onto your bill regardless of your party size. The 4% is mentioned on all their menus and the 20% is not, unless you catch and ask about it at the end of your meal.

For 4 people, we had a reservation for a Saturday at 11:30a. The place was fairly empty when we got there but it did gradually fill up by the time we left. We ordered 2x The Almar, Eggs Purgatory, Grilled Portobello Mushroom Panini, 1x side of Roasted Potatoes, 1x side of Organic, Thick-Cut Bacon, 1x Spritz, 2x Mimosa, 2x The Great Saint, and 2x The Dumbo. The food tasted fine and everything was going well until we asked for the bill and saw that they've:
1. charged another table's entire tab onto ours,
2. charged us for a drink they said they'd remove because they missed it the first time around, and
2. added a 20% gratuity.

When we brought these issues up, our server apologized for the incorrect bill and explained that the 20% gratuity is encouraged by the owner. He also said he'd remove the additional drink along with all of the items from a different table. However, when he returned, he said, ""I removed all of the incorrectly added items and the 20% gratuity but I'm not going to remove the drink anymore."" We reminded him that he said he'd remove the drink but he slams his fist on our table and says, ""I'm not going to argue about this with you. This is the final bill."" At this point, we're shocked and just staring at him as he walked away.

A few days later, I wrote in directly to the restaurant about this unprofessional behavior and inexcusable experience. The owner apologized and invited us back for a second visit; we've responded asking when he'd like us to return but he hasn't replied and it's been over two weeks. Given how our brunch turned out and how the owner handled the follow up, I don't believe a good dining experience is a priority for AlMar and I don't think I'll ever return again.

An OK place. Stopped by for brunch, lured in by good Yelp rank, but experienced a rather sub-par meal.
If you rarely have cash on you, be prepared to pay 4% extra for using your credit card here! I was really appalled to see that info on the menu and I find it really disgraceful in today's bitcoin dnage...
Our server was very quiet and though not entirely lethargic, it took forever to order, get a beer and especially get the check (which would have never come if it wasn't for the other server who was much more efficient). This poor service had a lot to do with the poor impression of the place.
The place itself is old and in a desperate need of fresh coat of paint on the dirty walls and ceiling. There is only one co-ed restroom.
The food is OK. My husband had a carbonara, which was good but the portion was small.
I had the sandwich with scrambled eggs, bacon, cheese and veggies on a brioche bun. They ran out of avocado, so offered to sub with spinach. When the sandwich came with no spinach, I asked and they brought it as a side 10 min later, when I was half through my meal.
After all these hiccups, there is no need for me to go back.

Bland food and mediocre service. Not a place I would bring visiting friends. The restaurant is large and food is reasonably priced but I was extremely disappointed by the quality.

Came for Sunday brunch and was told they couldn't seat three of us at a four person table for fear of ""messing up the flow"" even though there were many tables available.

Egg in a Cloud: We came to try (and take photos of) this. I was impressed by how fluffy they made the egg white. It really looked like a cloud. It didn't have much taste but the bread, ham and cheese below were good. The spinach on the side was also super bland and watery.

Burrata Salad: Lots of olives, super bland, salad had no flavor but burrata was okay.

Crispy Risotto Cake: The risotto was super tasteless and extremely under salted. The presentation was unimpressive - a risotto pancake blanketed by two sunny side up eggs. We couldn't taste the butternut squash at all.

Bellini: The bellini was decent for $8, a little strong but manageable.

All the dishes had very basic taste profiles so they shouldn't haven't have been hard to get right but every single one was disappointingly bland in its own way.

Besides the food, the waitress also didn't tell us that there was a 4% processing fee for credit cards. We didn't find out until they'd already processed our cards.

AlMar wasn't a place that put me on my ass and think ""wow how did I live without this place?"", but it also wasn't a place that I'll forget about...that makes 4 stars appropriate, right?

I came for a late Sunday brunch with my fianc√© after a long night out and they had all of the comfort-style/heavy/greasy-yet-not-type food we could have wanted...very specific, but anyone with a hangover knows what I'm talking about.  We started with the ricotta bruschetta, 2 pieces of toast total and it was a great palette-opener - def recommend trying!

Then we got the BLT (added on avo) and the Old Fashioned Breakfast.  The BLT was good, but def too much either mushy avo or aioli, it was hard to tell what there was too much of.  The Old Fashion got the thumbs up from my fiance - the bacon was awesome.

In addition to the other reviews, definitely take cash out before going...their credit card fee is only 4%, but still, you have your bill, taxes, and tip, so adding on yet another charge can be an issue...our bill for everything (including 2 craft beers) came to $65 and with tip, $80...fortunately I took out exactly $80!!

I def want to come back for the dinner here...their pastas look amazing, the prices are so reasonable and it's so convenient for anyone within 1 subway stop of DUMBO...def recommend!

Tourist trap! On the website it says that they are cash only. When we called them they said they are taking credit cards. When we received the bill it says it is 4% extra charge if we pay with card, but no one told us that when we called them. food is okay, the quality is also not great. something that you can make yourself - sandwiches, eggs. I would suggest to avoid this place.

Made my first trip to Al Mar for dinner just a few weeks ago and was very pleased with the quality of the meal. Very friendly and helpful servers, beautiful ambience, long wooden tables, packed restaurant with a quiet buzz. Bread served prior to meals. House red was spot on. we went as a big group so we sampled pastas, fish dishes, pork chop, salads, etc. Every meal was a homerun, every plate was inhaled. we enjoyed the meal so much that we came back a week later and had the same experience! prices are very fair for such a quality meal. highly recommend to others!

Loved Brunch at AlMar! I was on a trip for pet work, part pleasure and visited AlMar for a brunch meeting. The Egg Toast was delicious as well as the Americano. I liked it so much that I brought my family back the next morning. My kiddo had the pancakes which she loved. My spouse got a smoked salmon panini which they said was delicious and a Bloody Mary.

The eggs on a cloud was the best dish here and the $8 dollar bellinis/bloody marys/mimosas were a steal (especially for the pricey Dumbo area). Also there was no waiting time when I went (Saturday at 12) which was a plus.

Lighting was a bit too dim for brunch so I took off a star.

Great little joint in Dumbo Brooklyn. My husband and I spent the day at the 911 memorial. I had never walked across the Brooklyn Bridge and it was something I wanted to experience. I yelped restaurants to eat at once we got across the bridge. We decided on Almar and it was the perfect choice. We decided to share some plates since we had never been here. We both ordered a glass of red wine. The rustic bread and evoo brought to the table was very good. We ordered the tomato bruschette, mixed green salad, and lasagne bolognese. Everything tasted wonderful. We finished with a glass  off grappa and pistachio  chocolate tartufo. Yummy! I will definitely return to try other menu items. Service was excellent and hip/casual atmosphere was fun.

I love this spot, I've tried it a few times. I can understand why people say the hit or miss thing but its probably just due to personal tastes. I went here a few weeks ago and I've never had something bad until I tried lasagne, the cheese they use wasn't very good to me. Very salty, needed more tomato sauce, too much cheese (not a cheese i recognized). The sauce, meat, pasta was good but the cheese was not what I as an Italian was used to. I've had other entrees of chicken and the pastas that were always great but this time I wasn't enamored with the entree. That being said it is still  a worthwhile spot but just ask questions before you order. One thing I always get that is absolutely my favorite is the tomato bruschette aperitivo.

Wow, so happy we tried this spot for brunch today. I remember when it first opened years ago in Dumbo, when I lived down the block. I've never been for brunch, and finally did today.

Get the egg in a cloud and the crispy egg risotto with squash and Parmesan. Also, get the latte, which comes in this day-fueling mega mug.

This spot is refreshing non-pretentious and surprisingly affordable in an area that's changed a ton, for better or worse.

I'll be back, AlMar!

5 Stars!!!!!!

Although I didn't get the opportunity to eat here, I am an executive assistant who arranged a dinner at this location - this past Thursday evening.  Not only was it simple and easy to make the reservation, give the credit card information over the phone, and ask other questions - but the feedback I received back from the meal that everyone had, was out of this world.  It was a group of 12 people from all over the world (Italy, London, Germany, US, ex.) so I was even more thrilled that this restaurant gave the impression that it did!  Additional thanks to Marcello is helping me arrange everything - looking forward to do business with you in the future.

Alright, so I'm not from the city, that's probably half my problem. But the Goat Cheese & Arugula salad I paid $12.50 for would have been three times bigger even an hour north. I was hungry, I'd been hauling ass through the subways all morning, I just wanted to put some food into my maw. But after clearing my plate (even slowly, as I was in mid-conversation the whole while) I was sad that I was still so freaking hungry. Maybe in the city I should have been prepared to blow $40, even $50 on a lunch that would fill me up. I guess I learned something new in Brooklyn that day. Unfortunately, it was ""Don't eat in Brooklyn unless you make six figures.""

Even the salad looked disappointed. Like it was sorry I had to eat it.

Luckily the establishment is lovely and clean, the staff is lovely and clean, and after eating that salad and drinking some water, I too felt lovely and clean.

But. Still hungry.

For residents of DUMBO, AlMar is an institution. A joint. A place where one can escape the throngs of selfie-obsessed tourists down the block and enjoy an inventive, well-crafted meal at surprisingly affordable prices in a casually chic environment. A place welcoming enough to bring your screaming toddler, yet cool enough to bring a date and order off the menu.

Dear Basic Bettys and Chads of Yelp who complain about the 4% credit card surcharge: I welcome you to the economic reality of small business in 2019. Did you rent go up? AlMar's probably did, too (except unlike you, daddy doesn't pay their rent). Most restaurants simply build this credit card surcharge into the pricing rather than give you the choice to bring cash, and if the extra $1 on your perfectly cooked ribeye is a deal-breaker, you need to go back to the McRib (no shame in that, by the way!). On behalf of DUMBO, I can assure you that we won't miss your minty vape smell, VICE-driven political hot takes about countries you couldn't pick out on a map, and the loud chatter (while I'm trying to eat) about your Rumble Boxing class or why he won't call you back. (I just met you 3 minutes ago and I'm sitting 5 tables over -- I can tell you why he ghosted).

This is New York. Appreciate a restaurant like AlMar. It's why you live here.

Great breakfast place that i found via yelp.  Had the cloud egg and it was awesome and  a fluffed egg white like I have never seen.

For dinner it's Italian good bit I have not tried it.

Egg in a Cloud put me on cloud nine! If you see a photo of this beautiful brunch creation and are not exactly sure what it is, here's the description straight off the menu: ""Baked Egg Yolks in Whipped Egg Whites on top of Toasted Brioche with Smoked Ham & Fontina Cheese, Served with Sauteed Spinach"". If that doesn't sound delicious to you, we need to talk. The egg whites are so fluffy and all the textures complement each other nicely. The price is a reasonable $14 for a very filling brunch, which is basically two meals already!

I called for a reservation for Saturday 11:30 brunch, but the restaurant was not that busy before noon. So when we arrived, there were still several unoccupied tables. This was not the case by the time we finished our meal - there seemed to be a long wait. I would still recommend just making a reservation. Location is super convenient if you're exploring the Brooklyn Bridge and Dumbo.

My reasons for four stars instead of five: an annoying fly buzzing around us during our meal (restaurant is open air) and the somewhat pricey avocado side ($4).

They are not cash only anymore and do take credit card!

We arrived in Brooklyn on a Friday afternoon after visiting Ellis Island and, based on Yelp reviews, we decided to eat here for a late lunch.

The restaurant is not large, and had been crowded at lunch time because we got there late and most tables were still taken.  It's a fairly noisy room given the high ceiling and lack of anything that resists noise.

We had the caprese panino, the farm salad and the chicken marsala.  The panini lacked much flavor - it needed fresh basil (a tiny piece there), which the restaurant could have grown by the barrel given their huge sunny windows in front.  The rest was good, not great. My glass of wine (Donnaluna) was expensive.

Overall, an ok stop but nothing really special.

I hosted a private dinner at Al Mar and was delighted every step of the way. We were able to get a full buyout of the space for 35 people and it was the perfect size to host both a cocktail reception and dinner. The venue is quaint, charming and rustic that made the space feel very cozy.

The manager was flexible with our needs and was very accommodating from start to end. The food and wine was of the highest quality and the servers were very on top of everything. I would definitely go back again to dine there on a regular night or host another event.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!

Had an early dinner last Tuesday. What a cute joint. We had a cocktail each, both super yummy and well made. Then the bruschetta with ricotta, honey and truffle parmesan. Not your traditional bruschetta but very delicious. I liked that it was on a country style soft crusty bread. Then I had the risotto cake and my fiance the barley salad. The risotto cake was so inventive and delicious. I will definitely try to make this at home. The barley salad was delicious too, I do wish it was warm, but very nice. I found them both a little under seasoned, but still delicious. Then we had dessert, lemon sorbet and the hazel chocolate torte. They were a great combination. The torte so rich and the sorbet tart and refreshing. We will definitely go again.

I arrived at 1PM and had a short wait. I put down my phone number and walked around the block. The receptionist called me just when I walked up to their entrance again. I really liked the phone call system as some places require you to stick around in the blazing sun until they're ready.

Admittedly, I came here for their egg in a cloud because it was enticing and a beauty. However, I ended up getting their smoked salmon panini while my boyfriend ordered their egg in a cloud. We also shared roasted potatoes ($5), which was pretty hard and pricy for simply potatoes!

I was not surprised to find that I liked my smoked salmon panini much better than the egg in a cloud, even though it's more of a sandwich than panini. I wasn't fond of the bread, but overall my ""panini"" was filling and delicious, while the egg in a cloud is a novel idea but not excellent. I'd say the taste is a more airy version of an egg, ham, and cheese croissant.

Great food & service. Stopped by for lunch and luckily we were seated right away (tends to get very packed quickly aka 40 minute wait). Got a cute table under the window. I opted for their lunch special which consisted of half grilled chicken panini & a wild shrimp salad. Amazing quality, freshness & presentation.
Also had their rum runner after. Definitely recommend.

A wonderful Italian style Brunch at Brooklyn! The environment is peace and quiet, and our table next to the window is such a good spot!
Food looks so good and is worth for photo-shooting! Egg in the cloud is rly creative (tho it doesn't taste as good as it looks I still recommend to try it haha)

Came here for a quick lunch spot since we were around the area. Cute little spot! Loved their food and vibe there. Their service was good as well. Brought my best friend there to grab lunch before she was proposed to.  There was a little corner spot there that looked like a dining table of someone's house and gave off the 80s vibe for some reason. Should try! Look at what we ordered

Brunch review:

$$ for your brunch options. Beware, your panini will not show up toasted?! Coffee is good, mimosas are better. The Sunday morning we came, they were out of portobello mushrooms, prosciutto and goat cheese. In addition to our options being limited because of this, our waitress was very new and did not seem to know the menu well yet, which made explaining what items were available a bit more tasking. Decor is casual chic and oh so cute. Bathrooms are clean and the food comes fairly fast. Also within short walking distance (2 blocks) to the carousel and Brooklyn Bridge footpath.

I almost wonder if I ate somewhere different than all these other reviewers. I liked the size of the menu and the restaurant is a nice location and size. Unfortunately that is where the likes ended, the host was kind, the server although a busy Saturday was distracted and didn't come to check on us at all. Grossly underseasoned, underwhelming and overpriced. I picked around the sandwich, left the salad untouched and yet that raised no concerns when the plate was collected.

I came here for convenience of being in DUMBO to satisfy some friends who were visiting (and had to walk the bridge). I did not come here for such a delightful brunch time.

This place is spectacular because of its:
- sweet staff
- glorious Bloody Mary, extra spicy
- Egg Toast, which is not as well known as the Egg on a Cloud but it is equally heavenly with the truffle oil and golden egg yolks and fontina cheese. Amaze.
- movie that plays on the wall to help you forget the previous week's stress along with rainymood worthy back ground noise that's the perfect amount of dish clinking and laughter

Such a sweet place for brunch on a sunny day with clear sky and possible non-voluntary walk on Brooklyn Bridge. Make sure to stay to your left and not get hit by the bicyclists.

*shout out to the Egg Toast again because I recommend 10/10.

I went here with friends for lunch over the weekend, and the interior decor of the restaurant was cosy and well-thought out. The food is okay... nothing special and not bad. It just didn't stand out to us.

However, beware. This establishment charges an extra 4% for you to use credit card to pay your bill. I don't think that this is right. 4%! I mean c'mon. I most likely will not be coming back because of this new extra surcharge.

Literally. Love it. The tenders of the bar are wise and talented; a vip combo for top-notch bar talent. Like, who would have known that an Old Fashioned can level-the-fuck-up with rye instead of whiskey? Not me. Not my lover (even though he is totally brill). But you know who did know? The bartender at Long Island Bar, that's who! Everyone here should be pretentious because they are so talented but honestly, they are just really sweet. My favorite employee is one of the runners. He's so nice and is always smiling. My only complaint, and my lover shares it too (we share most things), is that they changed the name of the Lady Burger. Apparently some annoying-ass SJWs complained about the smaller burger being gendered. Assholes. Does gender not exist? Can we not refer to anything as female anymore? Whenever my lover go in and order Lady Burger we joke for like 20 minutes about how annoying it is that people complained about the name of the burger. The LI Bar employees are always really patient with our complaining about it and sometimes joke with us - even though - apparently - a lot of people make fun of the people who complained about the Lady Burger. You'd think that they'd be rolling their eyes at us, but I've never seen them do it visibly. Whatever. I'm not going to let those whiney Lady-Burger-complainers erase my femaleness. I will always order the Lady Burger when I order whatever it is called now. With the pandemic going on, the place I miss the absolute most is Long Island Bar. I miss going there with my lover! I'm just praying that it won't shut down. Praying.

This place is the best. Honestly, go here. I'm not an expert on cheese curds per say, but if I had to guess, their cheese curds are the best in the world. They also have amazing French fries. The staff is super nice and helpful!!! We go here at least once every couple weeks.

Stopped in here for a few over priced drinks. I've been in here before so I was expecting that.  What I wasn't expecting was the wise attitude by the bartender.

The bartender was simply so rude to me and my 2 lady guests. I almost could not believe it!  The 2 other staff members were just standing there looking spineless, ineffective and sheepish. I think they were embarrassed about his behavior.

Try it out if you want...but if you sit at the bar I guarantee you'll get some kind of flip-ass comment.   In this day an age, I vote with my wallet and wouldn't come back here if you paid me.  Many other options for food and drinks, just steps away.

Long Island Bar is multipurpose, with one of the better vibes in the area; the kind of place you wish was down the block from your apartment where you can roll up with a book and eat solo at the bar or bring a friend for a nightcap.

Really a great spot, don't skip the fries or the house cocktails.

Still a solid choice for the area. Lovely waitress served us lovely cocktails and lovely wine in the very fun and retro setting. I'm glad that this joint has stuck it out in the great real estate battle that is cool things staying open in NYC in the face of crazypants landlords. RIP our brother, the Jakewalk

Oh hi bartender from Jakewalk! Happy to see your able hands crafting my cocktail!

Tight little menu of snacks and cocktails. I easily tossed back a few lemony gin situations before I realized it. I recommend. All. Yes all. I noticed folks coming in with pizza boxes so perhaps outside food is allowed?

It's an old diner, which as a lifetime New Yorker brings me a nostalgic joy I can't fully explain. I will not lie, the booth benches are original so they have weird sinking parts so you may have to shuffle your tush around a bit before you find your spot. Maybe they will refurbish them sometime soon I hope so please?

Come here for a really excellent burger. Delicious. Fries were a little too overdone for my taste, but others at my table loved them. The cheese curds were excellent! Having recently gone to Minnesota, I would say this is right up there as far as quality.  I would definitely come back.

It's like a diner but without the affordable prices! Everything is like classic diner things but double the price.

Also they have a very sexist ""ladies burger"" which is the regular burger except with one patty instead of two.

I went to this place with my cousins, we got there at about 7:30pm. Even though I arrived earlier (10min or so) and there was no wait, by the time they arrived, we had to wait about 15min for a table.

Once we got seated, there was at least 10-12min between getting menus, getting drinks, then getting our order. They were busy, but service did seem rather slow. We ordered a fish bite appetizer that was tasty, if a little salty.

I ordered the lady burger and while pleased to see an ample helping of fries and good cheese on the burger, the lettuce was practically drowned and the whole burger, while savory and well charred was just really salty.

That plus the slow service made it a place that's really worth just trying once, maybe on a slower evening. It was a Saturday.

We had a TERRIBLE customer service experience here.  The bar/restaurant was not crowded on a beautiful evening in September.  We had reserved a table in the back of the bar to start our night (at 5:30 PM).  Despite no other demand for tables or reservations coming in, the manager was very rude and aggressive and made us feel unwelcome.  She engaged our group in a nasty way several times in the two hours we were there - making us feel uncomfortable and criticizing us for bringing a large group to the bar (which is counter-intuitive, since you'd think they'd want to sell more food/drinks).  Ultimately, we decided to leave and go to Henry Public across the street - which was happy to accommodate and sell us food and drinks for the rest of the night.  Sad that I cannot recommend Long Island Bar.  I also followed up with the manager to notify him of our experience.

Gem in the neighborhood. The cocktails are so delicious and the burger we shared was decadent. The staff is friendly and the vibe is upbeat and cool. It's a great spot to start a late night, catch up with old friends or indulge on a weeknight. The crowd can be a bit rowdy but it adds to the fun.

This is, simply, my favorite restaurant/bar in Brooklyn. I've eaten here monthly for years, and they've never missed a beat.

The cocktails are an emblem of intelligence and restraint. The burgers are unique, without having any sort of gimmick.
The trout, the carrot salad, the octopus, even the mixed nuts are delicious and refined.

Add to this their amazing decor, and staff who are balanced perfectly between hospitable and reserved, and a huge sign that says ""NO DANCING.""

It's just the best.

The Long Island Bar is home to the best cocktail in the world. Truly. I mean it. I've been many times, grabbing a stool at the retro 1940s style bar, and each time the Dolores Del Rio blows my socks right off my feet.

This drink is not only pretty to look at but it makes my taste buds tingle. A mix of jalape√±o infused tequila, cane syrup, aperol, lime juice and the best ingredient of all - passion fruit pur√©e. It's spicy, tangy, sweet, and magical.

I've brought others to taste it too and they all agree - this cocktail is #1.

But I will say that I've tasted the Erin and Boulevardier and they are excellent too. These bartenders just know what they are doing.

FRIED CHEESE CURDS.

I'm sorry, did I just yell that? I rarely raise my voice, but nothing gets me in a tizzy like fried cheese. Even shittily fried shitty cheese is good, but rest assured that this is some of the finest fried cheese you can get. Do not ignore what I'm saying here. Drop whatever insignificant thing you happen to be doing, and stuff these into your facehole immediately.

To be quite honest, I would love any bar that has such excellent cheese curds even if they only served warm Corona sans lime, in lipstick covered glasses garnished with pubic hair (that's pretty high on my list of things I don't want to drink).

But this place...this place also happens to have some of the finest cocktails around. The Dolores Del Rio is my jam, and sipping that in their big, beautiful window while munching on fried cheese curds and watching the world go by...this is as good as life gets.

I think you're my new favorite bar, Long Island Bar. Thanks for being you.

This is my favorite spot in the area. Unreal drinks. Great staff. Comfy booths. No reason to go anywhere else. Ever. Can I move in?

One of the best burgers I've had. Long Island bar is a retro diner style restaurant. It fills pretty quickly because the food is so good, so I recommend reservations or being willing to wait. Their gin cocktail, Improved Pendennis, is absolutely delicious. It's hard to drink slow because it's so flavor full and goes down easy. As appetizers, we order the deviled eggs, which they master such a great classic. Then to eat, of course, the Long Island burger. The ladies' burger is a great option if you're not terribly hungry. Make sure you get a side of fries regardless. All in all great restaurant with cool retro vibes, delicious drinks and an amazing burger.

We came here on Easter Sunday prior to going to a brunch party. Maybe because of the timing, the place was pretty empty. The interior looks like an old school dinner, with couple of booths and rows of barstools along the bar. Bartender was very attentive and gave us water and drink menu right away. Unlike an old school dinner, they have a great selection of whisky and tequila, and not just the cheap ones. Right after I sat down, I spotted Yamazaki, as any whisky snob would know, Yamazaki is one of the world's top distilleries.

We got couple rounds of drinks, I like their take on bloody mary, instead of vodka, they have aquavit liquor in it. Normally I wouldn't like it because aquavit smells like black liquorice and I cannot stand black liquorice. But surprisingly the bloody tasted spicy and smoky and really yummy. And maybe we were one of those crazy customers started drinking around noon, they also gave us some complimentary torrijas, which tasted like a combination of French toast and churrios. Love love love.

So, yummy drinks, super friendly staff, I definitely will come back and try their brunch or dinner.

A true old school bar with great burgers being pushed out of its kitchen.  The double patty burger is topped with cheese and a fancy sauce. Aged flavor on the beef sets this guy apart from most double patties in the game.  The bar takes their cocktail game seriously so make sure you have a couple while you dig in.

One of the best cocktail bars in the known world. All of their house drinks are wonderful dance moves around ]drinks you already love. A complete night there includes the fried cheese curds and the burger. I mean, this burger is one of legend with an amazing house made cheese that melts like American but tastes of real funk. Come for an evening and enjoy yourself.

You won't find better French fries in the city than the magic that Long Island Bar produces in their retro diner in Brooklyn. If you don't believe me, head over now and prove me wrong.

let's do the time warp again. hit this joint up for all the Art Deco vibes, good drinks and food, and the ability to deluxify your burger with a $100 bottle of champagne.

well, okay, we didn't get the champagne, but this place is still awesome.

small menu but solid picks. the stuffed chicken croquette with cheese, potato pave, and salad mustard vinaigrette hit the spot. the chicken was perfectly crunchy fried on the outer layer, gooey on the inside. I will also confirm that the french fries are excellent.

we joked about getting the fried cheese curds, but only one of us had done a half marathon that day and it wasn't me.

I got a hearty chuckle out of seeing the exact same model of thermostats that my parents and both sets of grandparents had their houses.

I've never had a scotch-and-soda with a shiso leaf in it until now, but it was quite tasty and added to the retro vibes. is that Don Draper in the corner?

Usually fairly crowded the few times I have gone on a weekend, but well worth the wait.  I can not stress to you enough how good the cheeseburger and fries are here.  Yes, simple cheeseburger and fries, no frills yet somehow executed to perfection.

Best burger in town in my opinion, and the drinks aren't too shabby either.

Decided to pick a neutral territory spot as I was coming from the south and my buddy lives north of here... so there we were.

I got The Erin cocktail, it might be my new favorite cocktail. When I told the bartender I didn't know what Suze and Bigallet were (and yes, I consider myself a professional alcoholic)... he was kind enough to give me small tastes.

The bartender was smart enough to semi-insist we get Cheese Curds to share... thank God he did and we listened! The batter was so light. So tasty. I would almost go back just for that.

I say almost, cause then our burgers came. This meat is very dry-agey-funky... if you don't like the funk... stay away... but my buddy and I? Weeee want the funk!!! :)

You could barely see the burger meat cause the melted cheese was overflowing all over it. A huge heap of very very solid, thin, crunchy fries made this one of the best burgers in NYC (probably my current favorite in Brooklyn).

When I think about going to a bar and grabbing a burger, this will be one of the top choices in my mind, which maybe a gross disservice to (what I'm sure are) other great things on the menu.

On a side note, there's a back room, with a giant TV. I happened to be sitting in front of it, and another patron asked to watch the NBA Playoffs. When they turned it on, I could barely talk to my dining partner in front of me, it was very distracting and kept giving me a headache.

To their credit, the staff asked my permission before turning it on first, seeing as I was sitting directly smack dab in front of it. AND they were nice enough to switch us to the bar when it was clearly giving me a headache... but I'm still trying to figure out why there's a TV that big in a room that small? (Or why there's a TV in a bar that is clearly trying to harken back to a time before TVs for that matter :).

Went on a Friday night, been wanting to come here since they reopened. A great touch by getting served carbonated water upon sitting down.  Had one drink. A gimlet. Love the decor. I can only think of how this place was back in the days when the hospital was around and the docks were booming . Lively crowd. Would love to go back.

This is a 'hidden classy gem'.

So far, I have been here twice and for me, this is one of the best burgers and most awesome old-school 'dives' I have ever been to!

The restaurant looks exactly how it did when it opened in the 1950's and both, the beverage menu as well as the food menu is awesome and the bartenders and the servers are SO nice.

They have the best K√∂lsch on tap that I ever had in the US (I am from K√∂ln....), their fried cheese curds are to die for and the L.I. Burger taste FANTASTIC!

The Long Island Bar is a modern classic and every time someone asks me where to get the best Burger in NYC, I will take them here!

Keep it up Joel and Toby and thank you!

This place is an instant classic. I stumbled upon it while living in Brooklyn Heights because there just wasn't much else in the area, but over time, I couldn't stop thinking about it. The cocktails, though fiendishly overpriced, are simply the best around. You get the feeling that the bartenders are a bit pretentious and unattentive, but that's sort of the vibe of the place. Side note: It's super Instagram friendly, albeit a little dark. You can tell it's the place to be in a relatively quiet neighborhood.

A below mediocre experience. We ordered two cocktails (boulevardier and a gimlet) which were fine, prepared as they should have been.

The bartender with the glasses was terrible. He may have said three words to us, No, No, Yes.

One of the No's was in reference to ""is trout a bony fish, I don't remember the last time I've had it""

Bartender shrugs ""No""

First bite,of course it has a bone in it as well as the second bite. Fortunately those were the only bones but it made we want to get out of there as soon as possible.

I don't think it's fair to sweat a couple bones in the fish or maybe a surly bartender here and there. In this scenario it just seems like if the team isn't going to put in the effort why should we?

We went to clover club nearby and had a good experience to close out the night.

As a local in Boerum Hill, I've been a patron here a few times and have said nothing but amazing things about it. The decor, the food, the tunes, everything.

However last night while at the bar BOTH bartenders were incredibly rude and snooty. It was a Friday night and not busy, maybe 6 people at the bar total, and not only were my friend and I ignored, but when we asked for service the divas of the two wannabe machomen-yet-awkward bartenders acted like they couldn't be bothered with our presence. In fact, my friend and I left seething afterwards as if we were not welcome from the second we stepped in our own local establishment. I wanted to chew the bartenders both out for being so condescending and unfriendly. Don't be so smug just bc you're now in the newspaper as a top bar/restaurant in BK. News flash: it doesn't last. So disappointing, not going back. See you at Colonie or Chez Moi down the street, MUCH friendlier and inviting environments for locals.

Great dinner option for a first date. Dark, intimate bar setting, and an approachable menu.

Cheese curds. Everyone on Yelp! loves them because they're REALLY GOOD. If anything, order some drinks and get 1-2 order of curds. Nothing else!

""Dry Aged"" Burger was recommended on Yelp!, but it has been really underwhelming both times. Meat was dry both times. Do not recommend.

Went here on a Sunday night with my boyfriend to unwind before the week starts. It had a surprising crowd. Felt like a Long Island bar (I'm originally from LI). The drink (Long Island gimlet) was good. My boyfriend felt that his were okay. Would come back.

Super unique, fun spot. The burger is incredible, as are the fried cheese curds. Cocktails were exceptional, and the staff is lovely. The gentleman who tended to our plates and waters, etc. was such a sweetheart and clearly loved his job. This to me is so telling of the establishment and how it's run. Great date spot or dinner with friends!

Henry Public is absolutely charming!  From the worn and weathered original wood flooring, wall paneling, and saloon style bar booths up front to the semi-private wallpaper adorned dining room featuring an old brick fireplace in the back, Henry Public has a ton of character.

This historic neighborhood pub offers friendly service, delicious fare, well-made classic cocktails, and a wide selection of ice-cold suds on tap.  The burgers are also pretty incredible!  See you soon, Henry Public!

I have to start of by saying two stars were docked for the service. I never rate a place based off service but this was unbelievable. My group got to the restaurant around 6 and were told it would be a 20 minute wait to get our table. We ordered drinks while waiting and then 40 minutes later inquired about the wait time. She said she'd set up our table and seat us in 10 minutes. 20 minutes later a new waitress came by who'd just gotten on the shift and told us our waitress didn't realize we wanted a table. Turns out she gave our table away. So they said it would be another 30 minute wait. We patiently ordered fries and another round of drinks while waiting. Another 40 minutes go by and I inquired about the wait time. The new waitress tells me to go sit down because it had only been 15 minutes (it was actually 40). We decided to politely grab our checks and the waitress brings an apologetic basket of fries.

So the whiskey sour was pretty good, but nothing spectacular (even with the egg whites). The smash drink was bitter. The fries were really awesome.

Disappointed would be an understatement to describe how I felt because I was really looking forward to trying their food.

I don't often leave reviews but I feel like I have to in this case. I work late on weekends, which can be really annoying when you get off and everything is closed except for fast food, but this gem stays open late, and unlike most bars, their kitchen does too. The macaroni was amazing, shell pasta with 4 cheeses and bits of baby asparagus baked in mini cast iron skillet and served up still bubbling. There's a gorgeous runny egg nestled under the breadcrumb topping and fresh herbs as well. I can't wait to be back!

Side note, I love the relaxing vibe of the old school music.

SHAME!.... SHAME!..... SHAME! Is what I am yelling at myself for waiting 3 FREAKING YEARS to come here! I live like 3 blocks away, and here you are.....waiting patiently in all your magnificent glory.

Cozy and classic atmosphere that is both vintage and perfectly inviting for any group of friends. SHAME!

$5 beers during happy hour. SHAME!

Bone Marrow app that my friend licked clean after all the succulent buttery marrow was scarfed. SHAME! (ok, on him this time)

The Turkey Leg Sandwich......Tenderly moist turkey leg meat piled to the clouds with a fried onion topping and sliced homemade pickles on the side if you so choose to add them. All placed in between the heartiest thick cut multi grain bread. The BEST Turkey sandwich I dare say I have ever had! DELISH! SHAME!!!

For all these glorious blessings brought on to my neighborhood, and for ignoring the Henry Public sign for so long. I....am....SHAMED. (Cue me walking home butt naked with turkey sandwich in hand)

This is probably my favorite spot in this neighborhood. A simple menu where everything on there is delicious. The staff has been around for years so you see familiar faces when you arrive - the decor and lighting is really nice and chill - I love the burger, the fries, the deviled eggs - I haven't indulged in it but I hear great things about the turkey sandwich and the steak + eggs. Most times I bring someone out in this neighborhood, this is usually the place I take them.

A great local haunt...

This is my go to during the winter and on Sundays. The atmosphere hardens back ""old"" New York, circa turn of the century. That alone, keeps me coming back regularly.

As for the food -- the turkey sandwich is a must, followed by the marrow bones -- also, a hidden gem is their vegetable side dishes. They usually roast them and offer a mixed variety hat usually rotates (carrots were amazing)

Check out Sunday's when they have live jazz -- outstanding trio who take requests...

Overall: love this place and so should you!! Also a great place to have a drink while you wait for your table at Hibino sushi (not to be missed)

What a hidden little local spot! HP has a very historic, classic, vibe to it - from it's wooden pub-type atmosphere, candle lit tables, and old photographs of dead, famous folks like Fredrick Douglass (not sure why).

Excellent cocktails, and if you are looking to order food from the menu, I recommend snagging a table in the small back area to avoid the louder bar scene.

As everyone who goes here says - just order their famous Turkey Leg Sandwich w/ fries ($18) - a giant pile of moist, flavorful, rich, shredded turkey (think pulled pork style!) served in a perfectly charred thick toast. This isn't your basic dry Thanksgiving turkey, folks. Don't hesitate on ordering it, even if you aren't the biggest turkey fan.

Their fries were also on point - perfect amount of crisp and chew.

We also tried their bone marrow w/ toast dish, which was forgettable. It was quite dry and required a lot of effort to scoop out the tiny marrow from the bone.

I was in the mood for a burger on Saturday, and my fellow burger hunting wife had heard good things about Henry Public. Great, old-timey feel.

She went with the popular turkey leg sandwich and I the burger. I also had a seasonal Kolsch if I am being completely honest.

Anyway, I like my burger dressed a certain way. They typically just have pickles on the side, but they made it happen with the lettuce, tomato, and onion. I was very impressed by that. The burger was very good. Cooked the perfect medium, as I requested. Fries are good, too.

If you have read any reviews, you know the turkey leg sandwich is great. No complaints there.

I'd like to think that service is the only aspect that keeps this from being a five star review. (Server was cordial, but not attentive) I personally don't like to complain about prices, as I can find that information before choosing to dine there. But I do think that the sandwiches could be 3 or 4 dollars cheaper than they are. That being said, I really enjoyed the food and would recommend it if the price (and cash only stipulation) jive with you.

Very cool old school bar. They had live music when I went in on a random Sunday. It was late afternoon and only a few people in the bar, but the band was still on.

To say the decor is vintage would be understating it. The walls have aged photos. The bathroom looks like an elementary school. There are folding chairs to sit on.

They don't have the most beers, but what they have is decent. Definitely worth stopping in for a low key drink.

Walked by on our way to dinner and decided to go back for a drink after - can't comment on the food but our drinks were great. Definitely pricey but standard for what it was - nice, interesting cocktails in NYC. The service was quick and the bartender was friendly. It was very busy when we went but it wasn't too loud. Would definitely go back if I was in the area again.

Such a cute place!  Old school vibe with live jazz every Sunday from 3-7.  Fun and unique cocktails and a super friendly staff.  A great place to hang with friends.  The tables are small so I wouldn't recommend large groups.
Really cool little neighborhood bar, with an awesome colonial feel! The drinks were equally good, though the beer selection was kinda lacking IMO.

Love this place neighborhood spot. Well-worn (in the best way)  and comfortable with the feeling of a country pub in England. Fabulous music during the day on the weekends (I think Sundays but check on that) and the food is gastropub-style but less heavy.

It's rare to find a place like this that serves up great drink, food and wonderful service (especially the bartenders) and a really nice, varied crowd.

My husband and I loved this place until I got sick to the point of vomiting. It was so bad! :(   The first time it happened, I thought to myself, perhaps I have some sort of stomach bug, but when it happened the second time after eating the exact same thing there, I began to wonder....Hmmmm...Anyway, not discouraging anyone from going there, just warning you to take heed.

I feel like I just made love to a sandwich.

There should be a complimentary cigarette after every meal.

Service was great. Cocktails were great. I would run away and start a new life with the turkey leg sandwich.

If you walk in here, it's going to feel like you stepped back in time. It's like an old house became a bar/kitchen for locals to escape the norm.

I've yet to try the food, but drinks are great (albeit expensive for this area) and there's live entertain regularly. My favorite drink is the sweet liberty smash -- yum!

OH, it's cash only, so remember to bring a $100 bill for ya drinks!

Always wanted to try the burger here. Today I did and I was extremely underwhelmed by the quality, old bun, dryness, lack of add-ons (pickles only). I will say that the fries are pretty solid.
The drinks are also good... but I'd hold out for a superior burger elsewhere.

The service was great! The decor is lovely and I do appreciate the flashback to old English country. The food however solidifies the stereotype of bland gastronomy that even the English speak of themselves. The burger was a bad combo of powerful cheese and bland over cooked beef (though I asked for it rare), the fries were boring skinny salty sticks. The English breakfast was as boring as it sounds as well.
Nice place for drinks. Keep it at that.

I can't even begin to tell you how excellent my meal was.    My son and I were in Brooklyn for one night, and were starving at midnight.  When we found Henry public we did not have high expectations. When you enter the restaurant it's like a step back in time to an old New England pub. The waiter was very helpful and kind. I ordered pot roast which was the best pot roast I've had in my life. The smashed root vegetables and roasted parsnips were delicious. I don't remember but my son had but he was thrilled. We finished with homemade donuts with caramel sauce. I will definitely come here again when we visit Brooklyn.

*Now accepting credit cards*

I could have loved this place. The decor is cozy and charming, and the turkey leg sandwich & fries are perfect comfort food. Great cocktails.
But the service! I can't think of an excuse for how inattentive and slow the employees on the floor were. It was a quiet night and the bartender had plenty of time to chat with a friend & eat dinner while we waited for the waitress to appear... and waited for our drinks to appear... There seems to be some confusion & lack of communication between employees- or maybe they're just uninterested. Left us feeling not quite relaxed.

Our salvation after a chilly late night arrival from Newark. Hot, good food available late (order the pickles), great tunes, perfect lighting and a friendly barkeep named Justin who is celebrating a birthday today. Couldn't have asked for a better welcome to NYC.

Bad burger = bad food.   cheddar cheese is sourtasting and messes up burger.  They only offer cheddar.

Fries are not exciting.  If coming for the ""cool"" vibe, i get it.   But the food is not cool.

Ok this quirky bar is still quirky and I am just not enough of a drinker to appreciate the quality of the cocktails they make but I must say I was pleasantly surprised by Henry Public's brunch.

After walking down Atlantic at 2pm on a Sunday in search of a place that would seat 5 of us and repeatedly being told the wait would be 45 minutes, we arrived at Henry Public and sat at the bar enjoying some drinks waiting for our table which only took 15 minutes. Score!

The menu is small, but everything on it looked delicious. They also have daily specials. My recommendation is to get an order of the Wilkinsons (dough balls with jam) and the Sweet & Salty French Style toast for the table and then order your own meal on top of it. It's a lot of food but then you don't have to make the decision between a sweet brunch or a savory one like the Turkey leg sandwich (which is enormous) or an egg dish.

I'm not sure I've ever been to Henry Public during daylight before but it gave me a chance to appreciate the decor a lot more than I do during my night visits. You feel like you're sitting in someone's dining room in the 1800's (and you probably are).

My only complaint is a minor one. There seemed to be only one waitress for the entire restaurant which slowed things down a bit. It's not enough of a minus for me not to return.

Excellent brunch!

Over priced and over hyped but it's open late and serves food which is why I keep coming back. The drinks are good and the staff is very nice and quirky. The crowd is what I would describe as upscale hipster but not quite ready to be a full fledged yuppie.

I wish they had a bigger menu and it were a little quieter

Came around 7pm on a Friday for dinner. The timing was perfect because it appeared to get pretty packed as we were leaving. Cute little quaint place, felt like I was in someone's house. Turkey leg sandwich was delicious and I was even more impressed with their sweet potato mash. They were so light and fluffy! Sadly there was a long hair in my sandwich. Understand it happens, I was just a bit grossed out. But customer service was good and I am glad I checked it out. Order their speciality dessert. Reminded me of zeppoles. Warm and delicious. I would like to come back for brunch or lunch. Was

Yeah, I'm so not feeling it. I walked into this place and immediately fell in love with the old timey vibe, the Edison bulbs hanging from the ceiling, the old, tiny booths and pressed tin ceilings. Circa 1938. Not quite Speakeasy, but Post Prohib chic (really, you can tell me I'm talking out of my...) This kind of bar has been popping up on the regular in this part of Brooklyn. But what else hit me as soon as I sat down? The lousy acoustics. Expect to be shouting to the person sitting one foot away.

But that wouldn't be so bad, really. I probably would opt to go elsewhere on Atlantic (love that cute new French place that opened up, but it seems to close hella early on a Thursday night) and if I wanted a loud and boisterous setting, Last Exit is right there, too. It's just that the loudness is so at odds with what seems like an intimate vibe.

Again, that's not my main issue with Henry Public. It's the utter bull$hit of being cash-only. Seriously. If a tiny one-person operation in a gallery on St. Claude St. in New Orleans can take credit cards when the average tab is $5, so can a ""gastropub"" where most cocktails are around $13 (I had two decent champagne cocktails that I liked OK, though nothing to write home about). End of story. No sign on the door warning you, either. How incredibly ridiculous to be scrambling for cash in this day and age when there's an app for that.

You can keep it.

Popped in for a quick drink before dinner. Was tottering around like an idiot trying to find it because they are doing some construction or something on the lot next door and it completely threw me off. Doesn't seem like this gem of a restaurant should be there but it is!!

Staff was SO nice! Very accommodating, I only had one drink (something with Pimms in it, I forget what else but honestly you had me at Pimms) but I am very excited to come back for more! I got there maybe around 8pm on a Friday night and within the hour the place was packed with people jostling around the door!

No longer cash-only but just as delicious. Very cool vibe to this place. Still my go-to for a turkey leg sammich!

Off the beaten bar path CASH-ONLY $11 cocktail joint with good sandwiches.

it was a little annoying that ""cash-only"" was hidden in fine print on the menu but the service and food were good.

They are known for their turkey leg sandwich, which is stuffed with potato chips to give it some crunch. delectable.

2 cocktails, 1 beer, grilled cheese, turkey sandwich and brussel sprouts with bacon = $70. a little pricey but delicious nonetheless. I'd go back.

I guess a smile is too much to ask for.

Interestingly, this place has charm to burn. It has an old world vibe and decor that just brings you right in. You want to love this place. You want to ""fit in"" to this cozy little world, a world that makes you wish you wore more bow ties.

The charm ends about there though. The service - the whole lot of 'em - couldn't be more disinterested if they tried. I've been here a few times over the past year and the service is consistently cold, icy, distant. The bartenders are prompt, but in an aggressive ""let's get this done"" way. I've never wanted to ""hang out"" here, because the service is so flat and weirdly intense. No smiles. No ""thank you's."" Nothin'.

I had an Oddfellow cocktail, and it was quite fine. (The cocktails are inventive and done well.)

The last time I went, Saturday midday, the place was packed, to a degree I suspect reviews of HP are irrelevant. My hope though, is that someone who works there reads this, and attempts to learn & share the fine art of being hospitable.

Inconsistent service and the meanest, rudest waiters and bartenders.

I used to love this place. They have one of the best dishes to eat in all of Downtown Brooklyn; however, my last three visits have turned me off and I'm not going back.  Usually, I would just say, ""Oh well,"" and never return, but I don't think they deserve to prosper anymore.  They are inconsistent with their standards (sometimes they let you order the turkey leg sandwich with the meat on top of the fries, other times they do not; sometimes they let you place an order to go if you've been drinking at the bar and just want to take something with you; other times they do not).  However, the biggest turnoff is the staff!!!  I understand that the venue is going for a certain feel and vibe - and maybe they want the staff to look and act a certain way - but, goddamn, at least be nice to your customers.

Floyd is one of those local watering holes that should suit anyone's fancy just looking to enjoy a cold beer or other spirits after a long day or just catching up with friends or co-workers. Floyd is definitely not fancy, in fact, it really gives you an olden days western tavern feel. The bartender that served me was friendly and welcoming.

For those that enjoy live music and games (Bocce), Floyd has visiting live bands and other musical performances. Floyd also has games that you can play with friends while you're enjoying your cocktail, beer or beverage. Again, Floyd is a neighborhood bar the definitely caters to the locals and music lovers. It's ways great to support local bars and restaurants and Floyd is definitely worthy of the support.

So went to DUMBO to check out the Timeout Food court....yeah I hated it, so I walked away far and fast enjoying the water but also pouring out sweat like only an old bald guy in the sun can...I needed a beer! So I hooked inland grabbed yelp and found Floyd...an oasis on Atlantic ave.

Let's see friendly bartender, ice cold AC and nice selection of beer, indoor bocce(yeah my ex wife is italian so hate bocce) but plenty of nice couches and hardly any annoying young people...ok 3, the other youngins were quiet and well mannered. So yeah I love this place, so please don't screw it up and raise the rent and turn it into a TD Bank.

Floyd is a chill, relaxing bar. very spacious and tons of comfortable seating.

prices are inexpensive and there's something for everyone here: whether you like whiskey, craft beer, or you're not afraid to slum it with cheap whiskey/beer shot combos (that's all three for yours truly, thankyouverymuch).

and, for hydration, there's a big cooler in the center of the room, so you don't have to bug the bartender for water as frequently (such is the joy of being a long-distance runner).

there's also an indoors bocce court!

admittedly, I couldn't help but notice that the one bartender looked an awful lot like my uncle, which only made the place better.

After taking a long walk through the neighborhood, we found Floyd. This was truly a gift because all the other places to drink on a Saturday were a little too... well not our speed. Either a little too fancy or an older crowd. We were looking for comfortable leaning on dive and we found it in Floyd. Pulled up a stool and ordered some Red Stripe for the bartender who was super nice, forgot her name, and enjoyed a couple of hours. It really seemed to be a neighborhood spot and there were a lot of regulars (which is a quality I look for in a bar). It's a really nice space with baci ball too. It's a spot that the neighborhood needs, for sure and I'll be back.

I invited a lot of friends here for a going away on Saturday. The Bar tender (I'm kicking myself for not remembering her name) was just the best. It was just her tending to a Saturday crowd plus our big group for the first couple of hours and she was just so cool about it all. Great place to hang with a group of friends or to pop in and chat with the staff behind the bar. A neighborhood spot we will miss. Thanks!

Had a great time...other than trying to play bocce. A group of apparent ""league"" players decided they wanted to control the court...but not by skill. They just kept skipping over names on the list and lying about it. The first time was when my friend's name was bypassed. Realized definitively when I asked some guys reviewing the list who was up next.  Turns out I was supposedly on the court currently playing despite standing on the sidelines. Never made it on to the court.

Don't even think about accidentally bringing a baby to Floyd. You will be reminded of how arbitrary discrimination works. You will be told to leave, and the bartender will place a ""no children allowed"" sign on the door.

It's interesting to see that all humans aren't treated equally at Floyd. Perhaps it's a symptom of Trump's America.

Better luck next time, i.e. never again.

+1 point for the Madmen trailer being parked out front, a celeb sighting, and someone confusing me for a director.

No glitz, no glam, but I appreciated the simplicity of this bar.

After braving through the chaos of 5th avenue the day after Christmas, it was nice to find some peace, tranquility and DRINKS.

The tap beer and wine selection aren't extensive, but you'll definitely enjoy the few craft beers on tap and the generous wine pours from the bartender.

Prices were reasonable. For my glass of Malbec and my boyfriend's IPA, our bill was $14. Plus, the bartender was extremely nice and attentive.

If you want a quiet evening with friends, I'd highly recommend Floyd!

HAHA I LOVE THIS SPOT!

I am NOT a hipster but I love the vibe that this place has. Its has mellow music which allows you to to hear who you are talking to, thats always a plus.

The bar tender is pretty cool, and although there is no kitchen they allow you to go out and get food and eat in inside the bar. What makes it even better is that there are couches here.

Now heres the best part- IT HAS A BOCCHE BALL COURT IN THE BACK!!! I learned how to play and now all I want to do is go back there.

I think the place is a bit overrated from what I was hoping for coming in. First time on a Saturday afternoon into evening. First thing I saw before coming was they had bocce, but in reality it's more like bocce meets bowling because you roll the ball because the court is just wood.

I feel bad, but there was literally only 1 woman working the entire place. She was so overworked, and had no help. As a result, the service time was really bad. She had a crowded bar, but could barely keep up with demand, and as a result, there was no one to go around cleaning up besides her on the off chance she had a second to breath.

Drinks were fine, nothing to write home about. Reasonably priced. I came in from Manhattan so I probably won't make the trip back out. We found a good spot for dinner down the block easily enough so that was fine.

This place is decent bar but the dark haired female bartender (manager?) could not be any less friendly.  Acts as if she's angry to be there, and annoyed to be helping you.  And if you bring a toddler in there prepare for the stink eye.  This bar is in cobble hill.  Not asking you to have a kids menu but for the love of god don't make people feel guilty about having a child (provided he or she is well behaved).

Ample seating and standing room? Check.
Activities for bros or those who have a competitive spirit? Check.
A great beer selection? No, and at the end of the day, the drink selection is determinative of how good a bar is.
Floyd is your average neighborhood bar that offers a laid-back time for locals (or the occasional student crowd). However, it just doesn't warrant a visit if you reside in another neighborhood.

My friend mentioned going to a birthday Friday night of someone I possibly met once years upon years ago. Of course I sprung for the opportunity to catch up and check out some places in Cobble Hill. Floyd's I vaguely remember hanging out in briefly possibly 4 or 5 years ago with a friend that had just moved from Michigan. I remember being annoyed at how crowded it was with her friends and walked out before purchasing a drink. This time it wasn't that bad. The people throwing the celebration had the back of the bar reserved. Also, the front of the bar wasn't too bad because we managed to get seats at the bar.

Drinks during non-happy hour: Everything is pretty much $6. Wells and beer. My friend wasn't sure what she wanted so I suggested a lighter wheat beer and actually went with the Allagash as well. Unfortunately, she realized that she didn't like her beer after two sips or most beers and strongly encouraged me out of fascination to chug mine and chug hers so she can order 2 more drinks and close out her tab. This is where Ingrid makes life mistakes. I'm fully capable of chugging a beer faster than most men. Head hits the table. We discussed what she would possibly like next because we doubted they would serve white Russians (her drink of choice) and I recommended trying a Tequila Sunrise. The bartender was trying but she made it with pineapple juice. That is a Florida Sunrise, folks. My knowing this is probably not a great thing. Very boozy and delicious but not the right mix.

I like the d√©cor of the place. It's apparently Union Hall's twin sister bar. We don't like when bars have twin sisters because it just takes away from its originality. But they ALSO have bocce ball and beer cheese here with antiquated furniture and couches. Union Hall's library is admittedly cooler but I like that it is not as much of a mad house on a weekend night. Also, they played a lot of old school Arcade Fire which went appreciated.

Ms. Pac Man, which I am terrible at and played at least two rounds of, is in the corner. We also came across a party crasher named Megan that night. She was a hoot and a half. I love party crashers that offer you free gum and take pictures with you in party hats and cake. Cake cake cake cake cake cake. Cake. Party time.

I've been to Floyd twice now and while this bar will never be my cup of tea, I can understand why people like it.

It's a fun, casual sports bar reminiscent of your favorite college spot (great for groups, mixed drinks in plastic cups, etc.) Thats all great... if that's your thing. But if you're like me and prefer more upscale, intimate bars with a solid wine selection, Floyd may not be your favorite.

Bocce what? The last thing one expects to see when walking into a bar is a clay court, designed to play a game that old Italian guys have loved since time immemorial. But hey, its Brooklyn right?

Turns out that bocce ball is pretty much the best. Was it because I am uber competitive? Maybe. Or maybe it was the fact that you can get a decently priced beer while you're rolling bocce. Either way, this is the main draw to Floyds, along with the unpretentious vibe. Walking in, the first thing that struck me (beyond the obvious court) was how dark the back was. But it kind of worked for the place, especially for the arena (like I said, I'm competitive). There's old wooden furniture and old couches that look like they came right out of the 70's, along with an old Packman machine in the back to round out the flavor.  We ordered up a round of cheap beers (it was happy hour) and got to work playing bocce. Not a terribly hard game to learn, we were quickly joined by some others who wanted in. I think this is the beauty of a place like Floyds; it forces human interaction, which is cool. I guess.... Once in a while. The staff is super chill, they didn't even freak when I hit a low celling beam with a ball, making quite the noise (turns out trying to ""jump"" another ball is a bad move...don't try this*). We played a few rounds, and were eventually dethroned in an exceptionally close match (pains me still); needless to say I got really (really) into this game, but I'm betting you would too, so why not give it a shot.

This place is absolutely worth checking out; I'll certainly be back for another round of bocce and a bucket of beers sooner than later.

Very cool spot for pre-dinner drinks. Came here on a Saturday before going to see a movie. The couches were cool, and of course, being able to show my out-of-town friends a bar with bocce ball was a plus.

Bartender wasn't the friendliest dude, but he got us our drink orders quickly and without any problems.

By the time we left, it had started to get a little more crowded with annoying volleyball players. I had heard that Floyd is pretty hit-or-miss at night, and I could see that. On the flip side, some girl at the bar gave me a tequila shot because she ordered too many. So there's that.

Generally friendly faces behind the counter with room to hang out and bar games to play. Fair prices and it's the best bar in it's immediate area. I come here once a week and I've never had a bad time, great for the Brooklyn heights area without having to travel too far down Atlantic or to smith street. I'll be back again for a cold pint, cheers mates!

Sizable spot with great drinks at reasonable prices, friendly staff and bocce!  They used to allow dogs, which I loved, but I heard they no longer do.  I like that although they do not offer food, they gladly offer menus for places in the area that deliver and let you eat at the bar, on one of their comfortable couches, etc.  I'm always down for going to Floyd!

I used to love coming to this place but after last night, I don't think I'll be drinking there again. This bar pours cheap well liquor into expensive bottles. I used to bartend and I know a lot of places do this but this one got caught. It's inexcusable especially when you're someone with an allergy or sensitivity to certain ingredients that are in one vodka but not in another. Liars and cheats.
Detailed explanation below...

My girlfriend and I were there celebrating a friend's birthday. We each had TWO drinks (and I didn't even finish my second). They were Tito's with soda and lime, what we always drink. Most other vodka causes me to have a deadly hangover headache, even if I only had one drink and barely got tipsy...so I stick to Titos. Both of us have this issue with vodka and other liquors so we stick to what we know we can enjoy. Well, this morning we both woke up with the worst hangover headache we've had in years. And we both recalled immediately that this was how we felt when we used to drink other liquors that contained ingredients we don't agree with. So angry. And also sick :/

Floyd looks like a typical Brooklyn hipster dive but I like the comfortable, laid-back atmosphere permeating the place. Plus, I've never seen a bocce ball court inside a bar before so that ups the cool factor. The rummage sale couches and mismatched furniture somehow all work, maybe because they're arranged in little living room style seating areas conducive to conversation. We ended up chatting with fellow customers we didn't know...all because they invaded, oops, asked to sit our living room! My eagle-eyes even found a partially hidden outlet in a fireplace to recharge my perpetually battery-drained iPhone.

The bar isn't the type that serves the trendy mixologist cocktails, but they do have all the top shelf you'd probably want, plus a full line of Brooklyn beer. Floyd is probably hopping on weekend nights, but it's a nice place to relax and unwind on a Sunday afternoon too.

Great place to just wander into on our trip to NYC and first timers in Brooklyn. Cool, casual...somewhat divey (i.e. more divey than not) atmosphere. Long old wood bar with plenty of bar stools. A bunch of couches clustered around, including a nice spot near the front picture window. With the light shining in, plus Rolling Stones music...I could have stayed here all afternoon. Friendly bartender. Good beer selection. Tasty Bloody Mary (Old Bay Seasoning is the secret...shh!) And fun to see the indoor Bocce Ball court. I could easily see being a regular here on a Saturday afternoon.

I have to disclose that this review is a bit biased because this place holds a special place in my heart - I met my husband here 6 years ago so it will always be my favorite neighborhood bar.

That being said, I do think floyd's has a great atmosphere. I've been going here for many years, first as a law student and then with coworkers or friends when I moved to the neighborhood.

The bocce court is obviously a big draw and a lot of fun but they also have a good jukebox, a couple arcade games, and several seating areas to catch up with friends or get to know a date.  The drink prices are decent and the staff is not pretentious.  They also pull out a projector screen for certain sports games if that's your thing.  Lastly, they let you order food to the bar since they don't have a kitchen.  Floyd's has something for everyone!

floyd is a great place to stop in for a drink or two, or stay for a while since it features a full-length bocce court. the side tables were a little more crowded and walking around is narrow, but this is very justified given how the overall space is used for its primary purpose.

My friend and I checked this place out on a Sunday night. We both enjoyed the vibe here it was laid back and very casual. The music was enjoyable and the drinks decently priced. He ordered a rum and coke and I ordered a vodka tonic ($8 each) and we didn't have any complaints. There is nothing extravagant about Floyd's, but that is what I liked about it. If you are just looking for a cool place to hang with friends this is the place to go. I will continue to come here again.

Indoor Bocce, anyone?

yes, there's an indoor Bocce court.  I was in awe.

The vibe is cool, very Brooklyn laid-back neighborhood place.  It is dark towards the back though so we took a seat near the front.  Let there be light!!!!

The happy hour runs from 5-7 and it's a $1 off drafts which are usually $6 and $5 house wine and/or cocktails.  A good price in my mind.

Anyway, I'd stop in again if in the area but otherwise it was a decent bar like many others in NYC.  The beer selection is kind of small which is always a negative in my mind.

I have been here 3 times now and every time it has been good.  This time we had a large group, but scored a table in the back and ordered the bucket of crappy beer all day.  People on the bocce court were all polite about who's turn it was and not being jerks and the music was solid all day.  It's a fun dive, you just have to go in knowing that it is what it is and just kick back and have fun.

The thing I love about most Brooklyn bars is that they're usually pretty big, not too crowded, and have baci ball in the back and this bar was no exception. The only thing I didn't like was the gross couches. The couches in this place all look like they were found in some alley after a long rainstorm; everything was rotted and duct taped and crusty and ripped. The couch we sat on looked like it was covered in a coat of crusty rust; felt gross looking at it and I hoped it was at least comfortable to sit on but the crusty crunch as I sat down gave me shivers.

The rest of the bar is pretty nice, and it was cool that water was served literally from a water cooler in the middle of the bar, I'm
Assuming to encourage ""water cooler talk"". Decent bar, nothing special, but not good for sitting

Have stopped by here a few times with co-workers and once with friends. The bartenders are very responsive and pretty chill. It's dimly lit and they offer bocce ball in the back which is pretty cool.

There isn't anything special about this place but it's not a terrible place to start or end your night. The prices on the beer and liquor is moderately priced and there's plenty of seating (even on weekends). Always have had a good time when stopping by!

I love how no matter how lively Floyd seems to be, the only thing I have to wait for is bocce.

With good prices, friendly bartenders, and plenty of seating (thanks to what looks like the Meeker Ave Flea's entire living room collection), Floyd is just a comfortable, laid-back place to hang out. It effortlessly entertains both the slightly older, lower-key BK Heights folks, and also the younger, louder crowd from the south side of Atlantic; anyone can relax and have a good time here.

Floyd also holds a place in my heart as the spot where I started to go a little Linsane.* Especially since there was someone next to me, drunk enough to forget how sayings go, shouting ""Look at these apples!!"" in a Laker fan's face.
__________

*Recent events have me feeling more Lindifferent, sadly.

Very cool place. Comfy vintage sofas like a nice coffee shop. The indoor bocce court alone is worth 4 stars but when you throw in a Pac Man machine and a place to get fried Twinkies next door (Chip Shop) you've got yourself a pretty cool place. The beers are a little pricer than I'd ideally like them if you're not getting their crappy canned beer ($3). Bottles (even Bud Light) are $5, and drafts are $6.

Word of the wise, if you want to play Bocce get there early or sign up on the waiting list and expect to wait awhile (if you're coming on a Friday/Saturday night) because its a hit with the crowd. They used to be a very dog friendly bar, and still might be but now that they sell their own beer cheese ($7) I'm not sure if they're still allowed to be.

A dart board, patio area, or cheaper beers might have been the only way to squeeze the 5th star from me, otherwise a nice place to throw a couple down.

After being sadly surprised that Henry Public only accepts cash, we meandered our around Brooklyn Heights a bit while researching Yelp, of course! Then along came Floyd - a reasonably priced, laid back Brooklyn bar. Oh, and yeah, they have a bocce ball in the middle of the bar, too!

It seems everywhere you go in the Big Apple there is a 2 hour wait, but Floyd had two seats with our name on it. Along with some friendly and fast service, no less! The bar boasts a remarkable design without the way too obvious 'hipster' style. The furniture reminds me of a crafty and cute estate sale effortlessly embellished with old books and candlesticks. Definitely an old professor's study. All I needed was a pipe and and and some hounds tooth attire.

Well worth it--a very delicious and satisfying meal.
Granted, I've had their food in the past but somehow writing a review slipped through the cracks.

Fortunately, there are many choices of restaurants in Carroll Gardens that, due to Covid-19, offer curbside pick up or delivery.
Fragole, with its  solid reputation, allowed us to feel comfortable to order delivery knowing they're taking precaution in the kitchen and with the handling of food.

The following was on tap as far as the order:

Appetizer:
*Polenta with mushrooms in a Fontina cheese sauce. I would probably declare myself as not being a huge polenta lover but this appetizer would convert anyone. Finely ground polenta smothered with mushrooms in a creamy and rich cheese sauce. Extraordinarily delicious.
*Grilled Calamari served with arugula salad. A perfect, healthy balance to the Polenta appetizer. Nicely seasoned, grilled to perfection and accompanied by a tangy baby arugula salad. This appetizer is a must try.

Mains:
*Chicken parm with a side of spaghetti. Although I did not try this dish, I was told it was light, airy, not oily and incredibly delicious. The cutlet was large and accompanied by a generous amount of spaghetti, grated cheese and side bread. A solid and satisfying portion.
*Grilled Salmon prepared with white wine caper sauce and served with sides of saut√©ed spinach and mashed potatoes. I love seafood--a lot. Typically, salmon is not my first choice. However, I have been craving seafood during this entire lock down period.  I was also confident that Fragole's salmon would be a good choice. And it certainly was. The salmon was cooked to perfection (medium), flavorful and well seasoned, while the spinach and potatoes turned out to be the perfect  comfort food accompaniments. Overall wow factor. Both selections were very generous in terms of  portion size.

Fragole is a popular neighborhood spot all year long. With life in the midst of a new (but hopefully temporary) normal, it is good to know that old reliable establishments, such as Fragole, are around to help us get through it all.
Excellent!

Yall! This place is delicious and the gnocchi is definitely the BEST I've ever had. It's so tender!

Victor, our server, was super gregarious and brought a complimentary tiramisu for my friend's birthday:) since it's the time of covid, they are of course, all wearing masks.

Will definitely return for that gnocchi!!!

We ordered the polenta and calamari (which was surprisingly grilled) and black linguini, papardelle with ragu and mushroom risotto for entrees.

So glad we found this gem. Food is superb. Staff are courteous and efficient. Such a cute neighborhood too!

I had a previously bad experience with this restaurant because of the issues with the Caviar/ DoorDash customer service. I would like to give a fair review and say that the food is actually delicious. I had the chicken milanese and the rigatoni bolognese for take out and both were amazing. My husband inhaled the leftovers and enjoyed it.  I tried the chocolate lava cake and it was tasty, I prefer less cocoa powder though. I would love to go try the food in person at the restaurant than deal with the delivery apps as timing requires patience.

I do look forward to coming in person when the indoor dining resumes in NYC.

Fragole is my favorite restaurant! I happened to stumble across it in 2016 while looking for Italian food and what a great find!  The service is fast and efficient and the entire staff are extremely friendly. You feel at home as soon as you walk in.

Both owners, Viktor and Claudio, are absolutely amazing! Viktor has the best personality and so much energy!
Claudio is so friendly, warm and welcoming. They are both very generous and accommodating.
Olivia is so sweet and attentive.

The food is absolutely outstanding! High quality, freshly homemade every day! What more can you ask for?
My favorite is the Rigatoni Bolognese! The pasta is cooked to perfection and the sauce is the best I have ever had. But whatever you order, I promise you will not be disappointed! (We have tried most of the menu)

My husband and I went to Fragole at least once a week for date night (when we still lived in NYC).  We loved Fragole so much we even had our baby shower there and could not have been happier!!

Everything at Fragole is perfect!!

(Please open a restaurant in California! We miss you so much)      :)

If you're looking for a cozy, authentic, friendly Italian restaurant that always has quality cuisine you'll be very pleased with Fragole. From the dim lighting, perfectly crusted bread with herbed EVOO, to the rustic charm of the tables and cloth napkins you'll score points with a date (or even a discerning wife and kids). No hassle getting a table and prompt, but not rushing, service can allow you to pace yourself easily.

If you haven't gone overboard with their homemade bread and oil, treat yourself to some Bruschetta to start. For mains, check out some of their pastas for no-brainer scrumptiousness. We often go for the melt-in-your-mouth Rigatoni Bolognese, the Rigatoni with eggplant, the Gnocchi Sorrentina or the house-made Parpadelle con ragu (the ragu has braised short-rib in it). All of the portioning is ""just-right"" and won't make you regret finishing your meal (you won't have leftovers either). If you save room for dessert, try their Tiramisu, which is classic and delicate.

One thing to keep in mind is they do not have a full bar (only wine and beer); however a nice selection that can keep you satisfied with your meal and relaxed atmosphere.  Stop by Fragole to be transported back to the old country (or even old Carroll Gardens) for a consistent, memorable and yummy meal.

Lovely restaurant and staff with reasonable prices. I went with a small group. I would skip the short rib pappardelle  (it was okay, but the least favorite of the table) and go for the squid ink pasta or one of their specials and a lava cake.

My husband and I decided to have a spontaneous date night and had heard great things about Fragole so decided to check it out. We were able to get a table for an early dinner. Service was friendly and prompt. We shared bruschetta and the Spaghetti al Pastore and they were both fresh and delicious! Very impressed by the flavors in the spaghetti. Their sidewalk dining space is lovely. I hope to be able to experience their dining room sometime so

I thought that I was going to love this place and I just didn't. Things started out well with the appetizers but took a turn when we got our entrees. For apps we started with french onion soup and the beef carpaccio. The soup was great and from what I was told the carpaccio was good but we both agreed that neither one of is enjoyed our entrees. We order the Pappardelle con ragu di carne (ragu w/ honey braised short rib) and the rigatoni firenze (rigatoni w/ eggplant, tomato, basil and mozzarella.) now sure all of that sounds mouth watering but it was not as good as it sounded. Flavors were off and just lacking. Im regard to wine I tried a few dark reds and ended up settling on something that I wasn't even too thrilled with. Overall I wouldn't have been so disappointed if the appetizers sucked and the entrees were great but not liking my entree is a hard pass for me! Won't be returning.

Sat outside. You gotta try this on your own. Everything is fresh, flavorful and tastes like grandmas house on the weekend. Authentic Italian.

Always my favorite when I crave the rigatoni Bolognese. I have coming here for years and it never disappoints. They have daily specials and a nice menu if you are craving Italian food.

A bit small so it can get cramped inside
Outside seating
Service is always good
Good wine selection

First off let me say that the staff here is beyond amazing! As soon as you walk in, you feel extremely welcome! I had the pleasure of meeting Viktor, who is one of the owners, and he has one of the best personalities that I have ever met. So humble! And always so happy! Constantly had a smile on his face and his energy was contagious.

Now on to the food!

Pancakes- Some might not be aware of my undying love for pancakes!! These were pretty darn good!
The edges were nice and toasty which made it extra yummy!
They came topped with strawberries stuffed with a lemon cream that was so tasty! And a strawberry sauce that was delicious! I'm usually not a fan of fruity sauces on my pancakes but Fragole nailed it! No complaints!

Cheeseburger was very good!! Tasted super fresh! Didn't come with ketchup but it didn't even need any! The only reason I noticed that it didn't have any was because I saw someone else putting some on! (The ketchup comes on the side by the way, apparently I was too focused on the food to notice the huge tin with ketchup for you to apply on your own) haha!
Oh! And the fries were delicious!! Golden, crispy, and tasty!

Polenta was also yummy! It came with some bolognese sauce (yum!) and a runny egg! This is only my second time trying polenta so I'm no polenta expert, but this one definitely gets two thumbs up!

Rigatoni alla bolognese- This is a must try!
Not only is it super picture worthy, it's also super tasty!! The pasta was cooked perfectly, the meat sauce was delicious! You cannot go wrong!

Tiramisu!- This is another absolute MUST! I always say that it's hard to find a good tiramisu but this one exceeded all expectations! Probably my favorite out of everything that I ate (which isn't surprising because I have a pretty serious sweet tooth). But please save some room for this dessert, you'd be doing yourself a disservice if you didn't have it! So even if you're too stuffed, order it anyway! (There's always room for dessert anyway)

Even the cappuccino from here was delicious!
And almost forgot to mention the delicious warm bread that they serve for the table !

Everything at Fragole was perfect!
A+ all around.
Above and beyond service, people who actually care about their customers, and delicious food, now that's a rare find!
Definitely looking forward to my next visits! : )

We have been on a pasta binge these past few weeks, and Fragole (which means strawberry in Italian) was an excellent stop on the list. First of all, I love anywhere you get bread to start with. Not only did we get bread, but also tomato sauce to dip it in - loved! We got the bruschetta where the bread was crispy and the tomatoes delicious, followed by the rigatoni Firenze and string beans on the side. I cannot say enough good things about these dishes. The string beans were garlicky and tasty, and the rigatoni had an abundance of sauce (which I appreciate - nothing worse than not enough sauce) as well as cheese and eggplant.

The molten chocolate cake was also delicious. Our server was nice and funny. He gave us a little champagne at the end because we didn't order drinks with dinner (due to too many drinks the night before, which he got a kick out of). We thoroughly enjoyed our meal here and will be returning for sure!

I recently had dinner here for the first time. The ravioli with pink truffle sauce was unbelievably flavorful. It's situated in a cute area, and the outdoor seating in front is perfect for enjoying a glass of delicious wine, tasty food and people watching on a Saturday evening. I will definitely be back.

Came here for a second time after the owner/manager offered a retry. While the service was slightly better the food was still nothing amazing. I got the squid ink pasta, which I normally love, but this time it tasted like it was soaked in fish and was completely inedible. The manager however was nice enough to make me a new plain pasta to take home. He said they had to order the pasta from a different vendor that day and it's not usually that fishy but again, that's what I was given. I still wouldn't go back but the customer service was good.

Both the food and service were lacking here. I came here for dinner last night for the first time. We got the salad special of the day which was shaved Brussels sprouts, mango, strawberry and some other things, the esotica salad, rigatoni Firenze, orecchiette, and the risotto dish of the day which had sundried tomatoes and artichokes. The Brussels sprouts salad had no flavor at all. It was so bland I couldn't eat it. The esotica salad was better. I did not like the orecchiette, they must use fennel in their sausage because that was all I tasted. My mother enjoyed it though. The risotto was blah my aunt didn't even finish it. I had the rigatoni and it was so salty I could barely eat it. The service was also not great. No one came to ask if we were ok, if we needed anything, if we wanted another drink. Nothing. We waited 15+ minutes (after waiting so long I started counting, it was probably closer to 25-30) before having to ask for our food to be taken away and for the check. Not the best dining experience over all

Cute place in Carroll Gardens. Small but intimate environment. Perfect for business outings, a date or for a quick bite with the family. We made reservations for Friday. The place was busy but wasn't too packed.

We ordered the calamari appetizer, the black linguine and the pappardelle ragu. The calamari was excellent. Grilled and lightly marinated. The pappardelle was amazing. It was the perfect combination of thick creamy and hearty. I thought the black linguine was a bit salty for my taste.

Overall, great place to dine. The wait staff were super friendly and accommodating. Our water glasses never went empty. Food came out moderately fast. Only downside is they don't have an extensive wine menu or an alcohol menu at all yet but it's in the works. Unfortunately we sat next to three young children who were very loud which isn't the restaurants fault but still slightly annoying.

5/20/2018Thank you for your nice feedback Jane.  Did you know all our pastas are homemade, and made fresh every day?  I will discuss with the kitchen you comment on the black linguine, and be easier on the salt.  We hope to get the licence some time soon and so we can gain the 5th star from you.

Had a great dinner with my friend who was visiting from abroad. This was my first time visiting after seeing so many delicious pictures all over Instagram. This spot was recommended to me if I'm trying to have a cozy dinner and an inviting atmosphere. The staff were all amazing and helped us pick some incredible dishes from the menu. Would definitely come back again and maybe for brunch!

But I would surely recommend this restaurant if you're trying to go have a relaxing dinner with soothing atmosph

I came here on a Saturday evening for dinner and everything was amazing. The place is super cute and the food is so yummy.

To start, I had the bruschetta and a kale salad with apples, walnuts, pancetta. Honestly one of the best salads I've ever had!

I got the carbonara and my friend got the ink squid pasta. Both were super fresh and so good! Their portion sizes are also not too big and not too small. We ended the meal with a tiramisu that was sooo good. Can't wait to go back!

A super cozy restaurant with a home-y vibe. The staff really ensures that you are taken care of during your meal. The menu is packed with a variety of everything you'd expect from an authentic Italian restaurant. Obviously, my favorite here is the rigatoni bolognese. The presentation is unlike any other - as they stack the pasta precisely into a pyramid. (then you just knock it down to devour it) The sauce is super flavorful!

Would definitely recommend if you are in the area!

This is my favourite Italian restaurant in Downtown Brooklyn with a pasta dish that I'm convinced has crack in it, it is that good.

Fragole is fairly new and if you were looking for an Italian restaurant in the Court St area, I so very recommend this place. The owner is hands on and takes so much pride in his restaurant. The vibe is rustic and homely, welcoming you like an Italian grandma.

I have many a favorite dish here but the one I truly love, the one I get multiple times, the one I can eat seconds and thirds of is the Rigatoni Bolognese. There is something inside that just gives me all kinds of feels in my mouth I cannot describe it, you must try it for yourself.

But if I were honest, every dish I've tried here has been phenomenal. A hidden gem would be exactly what I'd describe Fragole as. I do recommend their brunch menu too. Both, the sweet and savory options have been lovely.

The prices are fair and if you're driving, there are metered spots right outside. Mmmm, now I'm hungry for some pasta.

I personally didn't find much wrong here (except their wine list--need more wine! LOL). The restaurant is small and quaint and on a quiet block, I think it would be easy to miss unless you lived in this area or was told about it.

I ordered a glass of red and was happy that the red they offer is a Montepulciano (my favorite Italian red). Went with a friend and split the Antipasto Vegetariano which was pretty tasty and was a pretty large portion. You can definitely split this among at least 3 people. I had the Orecchiette Barese (shell pasta, broccoli rabe, and sweet Italian sausage). Very flavorful but by the time this arrived I was a little stuffed from the veggie plate and their bread bombs, so I wound up taking a portion home. It was flavorful and cooked perfect.

The highlight of the evening (aside from the wine) was their tiramisu dessert. Probably one of the best tiramisu's I've had in a while. Perfectly fluffy cake to coffee liqueur and cream ratio. I wound up finding a small pocket of space in my stomach to house the entire thing clean off the plate.

Friend was unhappy with her meal and the owner wound up having the kitchen cook her an entirely brand new pasta dish which I found very nice.

I'm not from this area and it's kind of a PITA to get to Brooklyn from where I am, so I can't say I'll become a regular, but would definitely have this on an option list if I ever was back.

Super delicious Italian food! New Yorkers are spoiled for choice when it comes to good Italian food, but where I live, the Italian places that people rave about are mediocre at best, so I don't eat Italian food often.

This place was definitely a treat for my taste buds, from the appetizer, to the mains, to dessert. I ordered both my appetizer and main off the specials menu, and ate everything on my plate. Then I shared a dessert with my husband, but wished I had ordered my own.

For an appetizer, I ordered the Asparagus Wrapped w/ Prosciutto. Asparagus is my favorite vegetable and Prosciutto my favorite cured meat. It was served with some mixed greens, balsamic and parmesan. The flavor combinations were perfect. My husband had the Beef Carpaccio, which I tried and it was a solid version, but my appetizer was so much better.

For my main, I got a Risotto w/ Artichokes (my other favorite vegetable), Sun-Dried Tomatoes and Chicken in a Pesto Sauce. They were very generous will all the toppings, which is much better than having a plate full off rice and sauce.

Dessert was a Chocolate Cake. It was nice an moist, and a great way to end a perfect meal.

They did not have a liquor license when we dined here, which was not an issue for us as we were running in a 1/2 Marathon the next day, but we did see more takeout orders than dine in patrons. This was great for us from a service perspective. It is a small restaurant, so I imaging that it could get very busy.

Everyone at Fragole loves to hear from customers like you (Elite Yelpers)  Thanks for spending your night before the half marathon with us, but don't let a carb fueling occasion be the only reason to visit us!  BTW, we use top notch grass fed filet mignon to make the carpaccio, so we are so happy to hear your husband loved it.
Hope to see you soon!

Food is consistently good and the rolls are delicious. I wish they had a healthier chicken item on their main menu since when they have a chicken dish as a special it's usually very good.

Stopped in for lunch with a friend. I'm a new vegetarian so was excited that they had some nice options. My friend ordered wine. They only have two options, House Pinot Grigio and House Chianti (which was a bummer). The bread was cold and hard. The pasta, however, was delicious. I got the Rigatoni Frienze and it was amazing! The tomato sauce and mozzarella were super fresh and the rigatoni was the perfect al dente. I would definitely come back for the pasta!

In times past, Carroll Gardens had a huge Italian resident, and even though the neighborhood has changed, the quality of Italian food has not.

I've always thought Little Italy would be the go to for Italian food because of the ""Little Italy"" and because I grew up around the neighborhood, but after finding this cozy spot, how I was so wrong to think that!

Made reservations for a Friday night, because I've learned in the past that Carroll Garden's restaurants are always packed during the weekend and have waits up to 3 HOURS!!! Can you beleeedddddd that!?

The place is extra cozy and definitely represents family and you can definitely get the feel from the decor. It's nothing fancy or extravagant like you would find in Manhattan, and it definitely should stay that way. It was quiet early, but filled up fast! Make sure to make reservations ahead of time!

The service was good! Waiters & Waitresses were accommodating. Despite being understaffed, they really were able to pull it off! Kudos to you guys for your service!

And the best part, the FOOD! I haven't had such good Italian food in along time! I order the Black Linguini, and it was delicious! Even though I was pretty hungry by the time I got there, that dish really hit the spot! I couldn't be happier! My friend had the Papparedelle Ragu, and it didn't disappoint at all!

I would definitely come back for the food! I definitely want to explore the rest of their menu!

Fragole, expect me back very soon!

We've been meaning to stop by Fragole for years and finally decided to try it tonight for delivery, which is not usually the best way to try a place for the first time. But I must say, it by far exceeded my expectations. Not knocking any restaurant, especially during these unusual times. But ordering in during the pandemic has been a little sad, most delivery has been a little underwhelming. But our dinner tonight, was beautifully packaged, prepared and arrived quickly. (I wanted to take photos, but I couldn't wait to eat it, so I didn't). The food was nicely assembled in their container and all accouterments were included without having to ask. We started with the rustico salad, it was really beautiful and all the toppings were so delicious, as was the dressing. As the mains, we shared the lasagna which was excellent. The sauce tasted so fresh with a nice touch of basil and the overall texture was light. We also had the ragu with the homemade pappardelle, which was tasty. We ordered the broccoli rabe as a side which came with a lemon wedge, the broccoli rabe deliciously balance out the meal. This meal was really a treat. I definitely plan to order from them again in the next week or two and would love to stop into the restaurant once things get a little closer to normal.

Came in for lunch and didn't see a big selection in the area. However, this little Italian gem stood out. The bread and sauce served before the meal was warm and crisp! I didn't know what the sauce was but it was amazing. For lunch, I had the rigatoni bolognese. It was cooked to perfection and just the right portion for the right price.

Guyssss! This is the BEST restaurant ever!!! Must must must try!!!

We're celebrating our mom's bday and looking for a place that caters for party of 9. The catering menu is fantastically well priced with so much variety and you get so much good and fresh food with huge portions!

The owner, Claudio, is super friendly and easy going! He made sure that all the dishes come with the best fresh taste and gorgeous presentation!

Food is fantastic, fresh with huge portions. The ""Grilled calamari salad"", ""Hangar steak"", ""Grilled Salmon"", ""fettuccine with mushroom cream"", ""Black spicy linguini shrimp"" and the special house-made ""tiramisu cake"" ARE TO DIE FOR - literally!

Thanks so much for the amazing experience! We loved everything!

The food is excellent, the atmosphere is cozy and the service great. We ordered lasagna for our company holiday party here 2 years ago. It was such a hit everyone asked us to do it again so we did. The owners are great, super hardworking and a true American success story. It's a neighborhood staple. I also order out from here often too.

I thought Fragole was very good. The wine selection was quite limited and a bit pricey ($35 for a bottle of cheap Pinot Grigio) but the selection of food was great. I ordered the Tilapia piccata served over spicy broccoli rabe-very delectable.

This was one of the best Italian meals I've had in a long time. My friend and I started with the bruschetta and cavolo nero salad, which were both delicious. But the cavolo nero especially was one of the best salads I've ever had. The tuscan kale along with the apple slices and Caesar dressing melts in your mouth. Then we got the carbonara and squid ink shrimp pasta. Both were absolutely delicious and very filling. We ended with the tiramisu for dessert and it was delectable.

The service was outstanding the entire time. I can't recommend this place enough!

I've been here before for a Yelp event, but never got to play or learn how to play. It is often packed on weekends with either long waits, or potentially no room for the rest of the night without a (paid) reservation.

My husband reserved us a lane ($100) so myself and a friend could kick of the celebrations of our birthdays. We had a nice time and the drink packages we had with the lanes were unlimited wines/beer/spirits for $20pp/hour I believe. They also had a few mocktails that were good and since I don't drink beer really, I ended up getting a bunch of those and mixing it with their bubbly white wine/champagne - those were yum!

We had a really great host/server person and enjoyed out time there. We had a nice booth and got take pictures in one of their designated corners with their fun theme and props.

They also have a nice bar and giant games like connect four in the middle or board games and such you can borrow from the front desk - fee or something I believe. It can be pricey if you're not really a drinker, but it'll definitely be a fun night out with friends.

Wow! Something really cool that I didn't have to schlep to Williamsburg for!!

I must be living under a rock, because this place is almost in my own backyard and it's taken me 5 years to discover it.

After being priced out at ""private event"" at a local BBQ place, rolling down Union street,  we stumbled in here and were pleasantly surprised!

It's big enough that even with a big crowd there is room to stretch out.
The music is cool and hip and the drinks are reasonably priced at around $7 and $8.    The crowd slants to the younger side of cool, but their were mid-30s people hanging with their boomer parents.   Plenty of side games like Jenga and Connect 4 to keep you occupied it you're not flinging discs.  $40 per hour and you can have as many people playing as you want.   It's just a nice alternative to bowling in a stunning space.

Royal Palms is a daydrinking and birthday party favorite, and after my visit I can understand why. It has a pleasant Palm Springs meets old-school ocean liner vibe, as directed by Wes Anderson. There's the requisite cans of Montauk Brewing Company and cocktails in mason jars. It can absorb huge groups.

And importantly, it has shuffleboard. It's a good group activity in that people can swap in and out easily, it doesn't require a lot of strategy (or even hand-eye coordination), and sobriety is not an essential factor in your success.

Unfortunately, the wait for lanes can be long-- we came on a Saturday afternoon when the space wasn't super packed and waited maybe 45 minutes for a lane. It's about $40/hr for the lane, but I think you can pay more to reserve a cabana and lane in advance. I think 2-3 hour waits are the norm on weekend nights otherwise.

There's a lot to do while you wait, including Jenga and card games, as well as an indoor food truck to soak up the alcohol. It's a fun idea for a friend hangout where people can come and go. Staff is also great and have a well-practiced spiel on the game.

Prices can rack up here if you're looking to ball out, but it's not unreasonable assuming you split court fees among 4 people. The crowd is fairly basic; people are here to take Instagrams, naturally. (The bathroom is unmissable-- the flamingo wallpaper is by far their best investment.) But the vibe is not bad. I have no burning desire to go back, but I'd be happy to get invited to another birthday party here.

Wholesome fun for adults! Great, chill, aesthetically pleasing vibes. Very unique concept.

A friend continued his birthday celebrations here (as a walk-in) a couple of weekends ago but unfortunately we never got to shuffleboard. It was a busy Saturday night so not surprising that there was a long wait list. If you're serious about playing, make sure to book in advance or come during a less busy time... otherwise you'll be pretty disappointed. We, however, still had a fun time and I just loved the ambiance. I'd recommend coming here to hang out with friends, coworkers, family even if all the courts are full. There's ample seating/tables, plenty of board games (we played Cards Against Humanity), big Connect 4, etc. Also, drinks are average priced ($12-$13 for cocktails in cute mason jars), food is available for purchase (didn't try any), and music is loud in the open, airy space.

Conveniently located right in between Pig Beach, Ample Hills, and Dinosaur BBQ -- all very close and walking distance for a fun pre- or post- game meal/dessert. Super poppin street.

Spend a friend's bday here. We reserved the shuffle board court for two hours and paid for the unlimited beer and wine. The game was fun even though no one properly played through a whole match. Our server was super prompt and brought our drinks right away. The cava, ciders, and IPAs they had were perfect!

They did aggressively kick us out of the area right on the end of our paid time.

This place is so fun!! I've been with friends and brought my parents separately. Theres something for everyone (21+). You can play boardgames or other things like wall-ring toss while waiting for a lane, or just to hang out. Theres a nice bar and drive-in food truck for dining options. The staff is friendly and will explain the game to you. Dont forget to take some silly photos with props  (near the bathroom). Its not cheap but its worth it!

I'd never played shuffleboard and never would've thought to play shuffleboard if my Union hadn't hosted an event here. It costs $40per hour to play a game. 4 people can play on one board. It you don't know how to, the staff is kind enough to explain how you play. Outside of the shuffleboard, there are jumbo connect 4 games and other board games you can borrow. Go with a small group and have a game night out! They serve alcohol but no food. They do however have a different food truck that  services the establishment for one week each month. The night I went it was a tasty meatball truck. I'm curious to see what other trucks they partner with.
The atmosphere was great and offered some picturesque areas. Give it a try!

The Royal Palms is a fun place to go with a group for during the day! You're able to do fun activities such as shuffleboard, connect 4 and other board games. You can also drink too!

Just an FYI, if you want to play shuffleboard, prepare to wait a while. You would have to put your name down and wait about 2 hours and then you get a buzzard and wait another 30mins or so.

***The only thing I'm upset about is that you have to give them your ID to play games/shuffleboard and they lost my friends ID. If you're going to take someones ID, you are responsible for it. They legit gave it to someone else or misplaced it somewhere. Not going to lie but it's annoying to replace an ID and having the hassle to go to a DMV.

Other than that, yes this place is fun for a group outing.

I've been wanting to go here for years, and I finally got the chance last Friday. Our initial plans for the night hadn't panned out so I decided to go over to the Royal Palms Shuffleboard Club.

The space is HUGE. All the shuffleboard courts were taken. We took a number, and when our number was called, we received a pager. Interesting. The wait ended up being about an hour. According to the site, play time is limited to 1 hour so more people can play.

While waiting for a court, we played some of the free card/board games available. The drinks are well priced, near dive bar prices. And a food truck area is available as well.

Once we got our court, an employee came and taught us the rules of the game. We had a GREAT TIME. We played til closing around 2am. It's a bit pricey at $40 per hour, but worth it.

I definitely want to come back

The Royal Palms Shuffleboard Club is my all time favorite place to bring folks who are new to NYC and are just visiting. They have everything!!!!

Drinks, unlimited board games, giant Jenga and giant connect 4, shuffleboard, the only catch is that they're out in Gowanus, but that actually makes it better because it reduces the amount of folks that would actually come here and makes you appreciate the amount of personal space you can get.

Came here a couple of weekends back and had a great time with friends! We came late afternoon on a Sunday and the place wasn't too busy so we didn't have to wait long before a shuffleboard court opened up. Don't fret if you've never played before! Once you get to your court one of the staff members will teach you the rules, which was extremely helpful. It's $40 per hour and they'll let you know when you have 15 minutes left.

They also have an abundance of board games that you can play and life sized connect 4 and jenga. Lots of activities to keep everyone occupied! There's also a bar with killer drinks.

Highly recommend coming with a group of friends. Can't wait to go again!

I'm a big fan of any *sport* I can play while still holding my wine. So if you are trying to decide between some sort of activity or a night out at a bar, you now have a very cool middle ground.

I have been here twice now, and both times with some sort of group, so I think it is along the lines of $40/hour for the actual game. But you're obviously going to be playing with friends, so when you divide it up, it's not that bad. If you don't plan on playing but just really like the vibes (the vibes are pretty great) then you don't have to! You can just hang out, drink wine and beer and cocktails from mason jars, and take it all in. Besides shuffleboard, they have giant Jenga, and a few other little activities. They also have a food truck/stand with some decent options. I tried the chicken sandwich and wasn't in love, but curbed my hunger until we left.

I think you'll be pleasantly surprised by how fun the game actually is. It's fun, it's easy to pick up, it's a great and different way to spend a night out. Every inch of this place is photo-friendly but there is a photo booth available to ensure you get the perfect shot.

Honestly, it's 5 stars for me simply because it is a really out of the blue way to get together with friends.

Super fun place to be. $40 a hour but I think its worth it. It's a good activity to do with your friends. It's a simple game so it's a great activity for everyone to do.

There is a rotating food truck parked inside the place. The night we came it was Korean food. It was quality and very delicious. It was a bit pricey but it was a company outing so I didn't have to pay for it. Otherwise... I might have gotten food elsewhere. It was about $14-15 for a bowl.

Super fun. Tip for parties - the clock starts the second they give you instruction. Don't waste time getting food during your hour. Start playing right away! Eat before or after

What a very cool concept and great place to hang out. Games, beer, and a lively crowd. The bartenders were friendly and made some great concoctions. You could rent a shuffleboard space for $40 which included one hour rental for up to ten people and a lesson. What a great deal. They also had giant connect four games, Jenga, and a ring game. The music was lively and kept you jumping. This adult playground was full of energy.

Had a great time celebrating my friends 30th birthday here today.  You have to wait some time to play and it's a bit pricey ($15 for a small plate of food from the truck) BUT the food was delicious and the drinks were good too and this is to be expected at a popular party place. A lot of great photo opportunities and enough space to not feel crowded. Also a lot of games to take and play.

Super fun for groups! I came here for a work party on a Thursday and it was pretty empty. My coworker said he came on the weekend and it gets super crowded. The space is huge! It looks like one of those refurbished warehouses.

I always thought shuffle board was lame and one of those things you only get into when you're on a cruise ship or retired in Florida. Surprisingly it's actually a lot of fun!

Great for those who want to master a new skill and also accommodates to those who are petty and want to knock the opponents disks off the board. For those who aren't into shuffle board they have other board games and life sized jenga which is always a blast. Great times all around!

$95 per person might be steep but it gets you a blast of cool a/c for 2 hours, a private cabana, and a private shuffleboard to play on so you can really agonize over how hard to push a small disc so it lands exactly on the small square of space that reads ""10."" Oh, and all you can drink drinks including beer, wine, rose, and well drinks (moscow mules and whisky neats were really popular with our group). Staff are funny and friendly, and super helpful with teaching the rules of shuffleboard. The interior is awesome -- pastel-decorated so you feel like you're stepping into a 1970s cruise ship. Lots of other fun games on the side like XL connect-four, and a photo booth with tons of props. The bathrooms are clean and plentiful and Amber Hills Creamery plus a rotating set of delicious food trucks are available to fill your tumms with.

It's cool that they have this entire place dedicated to shuffleboard. Definitely unique! When you enter, the whole place looks like a giant pool separated by lanes.

There is an instructor who teaches you how to hold and use the stick as well as general rules of the game. I came with a large group and we only had one shuffleboard, so we took turns. It's not as easy as it looks! You often push too hard or not enough. People seemed to lose interest in the game pretty soon though, and most of us just spent the rest of the night eating, drinking, and talking.

The food truck that was there the day we went sold sandwiches, burgers, hot dogs, and fries. I had a hot dog and fries and both were subpar, especially the fries, which were bland and were not crispy.

The Royal Palms Shuffleboard Club is by far one of the coolest spots in Brooklyn and all of NYC. They run an outstanding operation here where one can indulge in a variety of things: killer drinks in a lounge'y atmosphere, fun interactive games like giant jenga, while hosting all sorts of events, and of course, a one of a kind operation around shuffleboard.

This place is so fun that even a novice shuffleboarder is deemed be an enthusiast after the first go-around here. It's an easy game but like many things in life, best enjoyed with good company. RPSC makes for a good date option, an awesome group fun option, a cool people watching spot, and generally a great place to visit for all folks. Personally, I think it's a great alternative to the usual nightlife scene and adds a dynamic venue to already impressive variety that Brooklyn has to offer.

I give kudos to their staff who do a bang up job night in and night out. Management keeps this place fresh by hosting a whole plethora of events and makes it so that even each night can be a whole 'nother experience. Sometimes they have a live band and a lively dance floor and other nights it's all about food and mingling.

It can get crowded on the weekends and I highly recommend calling in ahead of time for big groups if this happens to be a special occasion or friendly large social gathering for shuffleboard. Either way, this place is a flexible and fun options for all those who choose to partake.

Unfamiliar with the area but walked there from kick axe on the company's idea. Walked in not really knowing what to expect. It's a huge room. Multiple shuffle board lanes on each side or a large aisle that ends in a bar. In the far right corner is a hole for a drive up food truck. On the left side is a lounge area where I'm assuming a live band plays. Strange tropical decor and funky lights. There's another much smaller bar on the left sid of the building. Each lane has poles, pucks, chalk and boards to keep score. Quickly learned how to play and it was actually quite fun. We got pretty competitive in the late night hours.

This place is good for big crowds and group events. To play games you have to pay- which are a little pricy in my opinion. There is food, but from a ""truck"" which is inside the place and sometimes they run out of certain things.

This place is DOPE!
Atmosphere here is the key word. Solid music. Good vibes. A really great aesthetic and layout to play some awesome games.
They've got a bunch of games here that make this place even more worth going than just shuffleboard (boardgames of all types).  The bar was well stocked, and it was a lot of fun!
$40/hr per court, and no reservations for groups less than 12. Sunday night is the night to go if you want to actually play a lot / chill, as there are a lot more free courts then. Fri/Sat apparently have a really packed vibe, but I'm sure it's worth the time anyway.
Beer was reasonably priced, $6-8 a pint.

I remember flying down to S√∏uth Florida, unsupervised and unaccompanied I might add, to visit my grandparents on school breaks from 1986-1998.  I was always spoiled rotten with amazing meals, mini golf and arcades every day, and unlimited swimming.  What I really loved to do more than anything though, was play shuffleboard at their best friends condo complex right next door.  Maybe 10-year-old me thought that I was winning every game because I was a hustler, or maybe it was just my grandparents, their best friends and their neighbors all letting the visiting grandchild win, but I felt like I won every game I played on these visits.

Sadly my grandparents have since passed, and until recently there were few places to slide biscuits (play shuffleboard), but when I first heard of Royal Palms, I knew a visit was inevitable, so when my friend from Baltimore told me he was coming up for a tour of New York's best bars, I insisted we make a stop here, and boy are we glad we did.

Interior is roomy and vast, with fans and colors that ooze S√∏uth Florida - light teals and pinks abound, flamingos and other tropical minutia decorate the space.

Ashley is the beverage director and she has put together an outstanding program with delicious, kitschy offerings, including the Shuffleboard Bob (a wonderful batched cocktail with Gin, coconut water, lime, Peychauds, and a refreshingly sweet cucumber syrup), and the Smokey Gigi (ancho Chile infused Mezcal, two kinds of shrubs and lime juice).  Both were delectable, and on my next visit I will be having their Earl Ball...

Each day different food trucks come in to provide sustenance, check with them for who is there on a day you plan to go.

One hour of play is $40  no matter if you're solo, double or a group of 4 or more, and there is no prorating, so you Pay for the whole hour even if you play for less time.  That being the case, I suggest going with a foursome so it's $10 per person.  Each court time comes with a brief free tutorial so you know the rules and regs, and before the tutorial is over the instructor challenges you to slide a perfect biscuit (land a 10 pointer) and offers free shots for the whole group if one of you lands it - a fun challenge but very hard to do (he gave us a second chance halfway through our court time)

You apparently get free court time if you're in one of their leagues ($500 per season per team, $100 per solo), and honestly if I didn't live on Long Island I'd have signed up for a league on the spot - that's how chill the vibe is here.

Don't want to slide biscuits? You can play giant connect four, tabletop shuffleboard, one of 5 dozen board games, or Bimini ring toss for free, or, just grab a lounge chair and pretend you're in Hallandale Beach.

Royal Palms you've made a fan for life, see you again really soon!

Spacious but drinks taste terrible.

They have lots of games including cards against humanity, Jenga and such.

Must be 21+, ID is checked at the door. Shuffleboard is $40 per person.  The games were fun but the drinks suck.

First time shuffleboarding and I must say this was a fun new experience which I wasnt good at.  We were here on a work day trip.  The drinks were pretty good and strong.  Oh also there's a food truck spot built in on the side of the shuffleboard club.  Note: the line is LONG no matter what, but also worth the wait because the food was so good.  It was Korean BBQ this time. I believe the food trucks changed semi frequently, not sure how much.  So you may not eat the same food here twice.

Want a photo with the flamingos? BE PREPARED TO GET KICKED THE F OUT.

I ended up at the Royal Palms Shuffleboard Club this past weekend, around 12:15AM on Sunday morning. Along with a large group (~30) of wedding guests with the bride (my sister) and groom, we made our way from 501 Union to this establishment. All of us were admitted without any issues, which is evidence that they did not think anyone in the group was at the point of inebriation that would have restricted our entrance otherwise. While we had placed our names to queue for a shuffleboard court or two, a friend of mine and I noticed the flamingos to the left of the bar and decided to take some photos. My friend pulled out one of the step stools (spoiler alert: these were apparently jenga stools -- some of which were not properly labeled as such) for us to get more leveled photos with the flamingos and both of us took turns taking a photo or two. At one point, one of the female bouncers had been there attempting to fix the line/separator that dictated the area patrons were not to cross over to (the stage where the flamingos were). She had been having trouble resetting the barrier so I assisted her and asked if we were ok taking our photos. She said there was no problem as long as we did not cross over the line. My sister and her friends made their way over shortly to take some photos while we were waiting for our court as well. They did the same, some on the step stools, some below to create levels for the pictures. Almost immediately a male bouncer, along with the same female bouncer from earlier came over and started yelling at us to ""finish our drinks and get out"". I calmly approached him and asked what the problem was. He said we should not have been standing on the jenga stools to take our pictures and that we all had to leave. We were all in shock because we did not know that this was prohibited or we would not have done it in the first place (stool-level pictures with flamingos are not on the top of my MUST DO list). I profusely apologized and explained we were not aware and that my sister had just gotten married and we were just trying to play some shuffleboard and have a good time. He was not having any of it. I asked to speak to the manager and he said the manager was the one who told him to kick us out immediately (NOTE: If you are the manager or the owner, I would appreciate a prompt follow up with your first-hand reasoning as to why we deserved to be kicked off the property). I brought up the fact that the female bouncer did not tell me there were issues with us using the step stools when it was just me using it to take a photo but somehow as soon as 3 people were using them, it was an issue? She denied saying this thereby throwing me under the bus which was completely uncalled for. I would have expected a stern ""Please don't stand on those step stools, they are used for people to STEP ON IT for Jenga, not for photos"" warning. These are step stools that PEOPLE STAND ON FOR JENGA. IT IS MEANT TO BE STOOD ON. While we stood on them for a different purpose, I believe the sentence far outweighed their opinion of our ""crime"" (please note the heavily sarcasm-drunk quotation marks). He began to kick out the rest of our party who were in the middle aisle between the courts even though they had done absolutely nothing wrong (only 7 people had been in the photo and me and my friend had taken it). They lost out on roughly 30 people's business that evening for no good reason. My opinion -- the bar was likely over capacity and they were looking for an easy out to rectify their careless mistake and picked on the one group who they could do it to swiftly. This male bouncer continued to yell at our entire party all the way out. His level of boorishness and uncouthness was completely unceremonious. Only a handful of people in the party (~3-5) had had enough time to procure a drink so we were clearly not being kicked out because of drunk, rowdy behaviour (otherwise, they wouldn't have let us in to begin with). This barbaric treatment put a massive damper on what had been a beautiful night and it was completely uncalled for. I am keen on speaking to management because that kind of treatment felt extremely selective (I am Asian, and many in the party were of minority groups) and it causes me to wonder how much of that played into it. I am still in disbelief and hope ownership reassess their staffing strategy for security. Put them through training on how to treat people with respect or simply provide the definition of service and hospitality, since they clearly lack the aptitude to grasp those meanings. See below for the photo we had taken before they kicked us out for anyone curious to see the ""crime"" that was committed so you too can pass judgement on if we should have been kicked out.

By the way, we ended up walking to Givers & Takers and they were WONDERFUL. I *strongly* recommend you head over there instead of this poor excuse for a business.

There's nothing quite like it anywhere in the city! It's a huge space, great for big groups -- with about 10 shuffleboard courts, tables scattered, board games, 2 bars, and usually a food truck for the nomz!

The weekends are always so packed, so be prepared to have a very long wait time. If you don't want to wait, I suggest you come right when they open. Otherwise, you could estimate up to 3-4 hours. It's a great place to just chill and drink/eat too!

Coming on the weekdays is a whole different story! You can also reserve courts with a bigger party so everyone has a chance to play.
If you're a noob, they will gladly teach you how to keep score and how to send the shuffle down the board! It's so much fun and requires zero athleticism!

If you're looking for something to do or have visitors, I highly recommend coming here!

We passed by this place many times and each time it seemed like a real fancy schmancy place because of the security at the door and the attire of people going in. We finally went on a Friday night at around 8pm and found it to be surprisingly not crowded and pretty casual! We just moved to the area from Florida and this place does a great job of capturing the sunshine shuffleboard state. Since it was just the two of us, it was kinda on the steep side in terms of a date night- $40 to rent a lane for an hour plus any drinks or food- but it was so fun and easy (once the staff explained how to play). We didn't try the Korean food truck that night but it's a really cool concept that keeps you inside to get your food. We'll definitely bring our out of town friends and family next time!

This is a great place to go if you love being rudely spoken to by the staff and forced to leave for taking photos!!

We went to this establishment for a wedding after party. Our group wanted to take photos by one of the displays, which we had asked one of the staff if it would be okay to do. She said it would be fine as long as we didn't touch the displays. One of the security then came up to us and told us to leave for taking photos. Despite knowing that we had done nothing wrong, we had calmly apologized to this security personnel who rudely told us to finish our drinks and leave for taking photos. He had said that he didn't care about our explanation, and insisted that we were wrong. Despite telling us to finish our drinks and leave, he then followed us and told our whole party to just leave our drinks on the table and leave, then proceeded to kick out the bridal party of 40 people. This man and his accomplices were extremely rude and obnoxious.

Took me back to the time I played Shuffleboard with my Grandpa in Sunrise Lakes (Phase 3)!!

What a fun concept.   I live in S Florida, grew up in the 80s/90s, and was in town visiting family who lives in Brooklyn.  Went here on a cold Sunday afternoon before my flight home.

First, it's 21 and over.    I do think they should open this up on a Sunday for families, but that's me..although I didn't have my kids with me on this trip (adult play time).

Place inside is a trip.    All Florida 'kitsch'.   Even a big orange bowl, which might be from the actual Orange Bowl.   Old pennants from cities in FL adorn the wall.   All the chairs were those rubber straps just like my grandparents had at their condo.     Food truck..check!

Upon check in we were told it was 1 hour wait til play.    We said ok, and glad we did.  I made my way over to the Bimini game..and frustratingly played it (still so much fun).    Think we created a buzz cause others who maybe didn't know about it came over and jumped in on the action.   Then we found the giant connect 4 game.   Wife edged me out on a 2 out of 3.  Need a rematch.    Oh, did I mention full bar and beers on tap?

One hour is up...our turn.   We got our instructions (refresher..hey, it's been a bit) and shuffled away for an hour.

I loved the place and it's concept.

It was really fun, and catered to my competitive side. This was a wonderful, but not obvious, indoor activity for a cool November eve in THEE best borough. I was able to bring SWAG bags for my party, and sit and have a few sips in the cabana. We also had fun at the photo booth...Treat yourself!

WHEN: Novemberfest

We came here for my friend's birthday party and had the best time. If you're planning to do the same, request  Kristin as your server/mentor --she was incredible. Attentive, kind, helpful, funnand funny--she made the experience next-level spectacular. The drinks were also amazing (and strong). We will absolutely be returning. Thank you Kristin for elevating this great experience!!

One of my girlfriends did her birthday here and we had a blast! This place is in Brooklyn, not too far from the F train. Easy to get to and has a neat barbecue spot and ice cream spot next to it.

We booked a cabana because we wanted to make sure we would get a shuffleboard and have a place to put our stuff down. We paid $50pp for our AYCD well drinks/beer/wine package for 2 hours.
They have giant sized Jenga and a bunch of cool board games you can also play if you dont want to shuffleboard.

The guy who taught us how to play was great! He was an amazing server and made our time there a great time!! Kudos to Steve (I really hope that's his name, but if its not, its the ""skinny Jack Black""). He helped us get drinks at the bar so we didn't have to get on the line ourselves. He helped us when we didn't understand the rules of the game. He also constantly checked up on us with a huge smile and made sure we were enjoying ourselves. Please give this man a raise!!!

I ate here over the weekend at the new outdoor dining section that they've setup on Stone Street. Nice lamps on the tables, excellent service, food as good as ever.

This has been a tough time for all restaurants but Harry's really did a nice job going the extra mile to create a great experience with social distancing and was a welcomed change from eating out of cardboard boxes! If you're looking for an experience as close to pre-COVID 19 as possible, yet, with all the precautions, this is the place.

Steak was cooked perfectly and the prosciutto appetizer was excellent.

I even signed up to write a review for this place. One of the best restaurant experiences ever in every aspect despite all the challenges due to an unprecedented situation with COVID. The ribeye steak, complimentary Moet Chandon, but most of all, the service. What a memorable meal. It's worth every single penny. I really appreciated all the efforts the restaurant staff put and will come back to NYC just to visit this place. I can't wait for the day I can eat inside Harry's.

Its a horrible experience with cheap razors and rude customer service with reduced business hours and they don't care if they are rude and you ask for a supervisor they will hang up on you after they leave you waiting for 5 minutes
I DO NOT RECOMMEND THEM AND WILL NEVER USE THEM EVER AGAIN
I much rather stay with the awesome experience I've had with dollar shave club at least their products have never broken on me.

Came here for my birthday brunch this past weekend. I was looking for something cute and simple and they offered endless champagne for brunch so I was sold.

The service was great for the most part. Right when you enter the hostess checks your temperature. We all end up ordering the Steak and Eggs. Only problem was that I was the only one that ordered Medium Rare and all my friends ordered medium or medium well. BUT they all got medium rare some of their steaks looked bloodier than mine. I told them to ask to see if they can cook the steaks more to their liking, but they didn't want to bother even though I look on their faces seemed like they were struggling to eat the steak. The steak was a little tough as well. The rest of the food was ok. We ended up asking for some salt and pepper everything was a bit bland not really what I had expected. Sadly the only thing that stood out was the bread basket :/ For a bit it was hard to get someones attention for refills of champagne, but after I asked if it was ok to keep a bottle they were more attentive which was nice. The waitress was nice and gave us some more bread and butter to eat sadly more satisfying than the steak. We got the creme brulee for my birthday, but I don't think they are allowed to do candles anymore. That was actually pretty good.

Overall service was nice, but the steaks especially with 4 of the steaks not being cooked properly made me knock rating down. The endless brunch is a good deal compared to most so I suggest trying the other items even though it is a steakhouse.

We sat outside on a cool summer night during CoVID which was interesting. If you like smelling weed and homeless people literally laying nearby, this is the place for you! They have paper menus and are trying to social distance the tables. The waitstaff wear masks which is reassuring. It's a crazy time and they seem to be doing well so we are giving it a try! Tuna crudo is yellow fin and zero flavor and the scrimp scampi was also bland, maybe because I'm a good cook? The bathroom is GROSS!!!  They also tried to pull a fast one and charge us $222 for food we didn't order!! I sent the check back!!

Randomly dropped in to Harry's while walking through the financial district with some friends. We were intrigued by steps leading down into the main dining area. It's a beautiful space elegantly decorated with a timeless feel.

We simply dropped in for a couple drinks. Macallan 12 Year. I'm not a hard person to please in these places. Great place to space to enjoy quality whiskey, and conversation.

I hear the steaks are also incredible, so I'll have to pop back in the next time I'm in New York.

Disappointed on this 2nd Brunch Visit. Harrys has a lovely decor for a leisurely brunch.

This time we tried the Poached Eggs Benedict on smoked Salmon toast - it was cold and needed to be sent back to the kitchen. 5 minutes later it came back out - still only Luke warm. For $26 they can do better. My Steak Sandwich with gruyere and hand cut fries was good, but not great- served warm, wnot hot.

Jose did a good job with the service and the unlimited champagne is a great plus. The blood orange juice was delicious but no juice glasses were provided. The coffee is great as were the polenta fries stack.

Hidden down a set of classic stairs (think TV show Cheers) just a coins throw from the New York Stock Exchange is the the International Bank of Brunch - AKA  Harry's.

Take a classic steakhouse with its excellent wait staff (Jorge) and excellent Managers and add in delicious mouthwatering food and unlimited Champagne for 90 minutes and you have Harry's Brunch.

Picture ice cold champagne flutes constantly filled at no extra cost, blood orange juice carafe at $7 and great rich Columbia coffee $4 then add to these beverages:

A three egg omelette with super melty gruyere cheese and perfectly cooked crisp hash browns with toast triangles dipped in melted butter with parsley - $18

Then add on super thick French toast with fresh berries and real maple syrup with confectioners sugar and some unusual spice like nutmeg or vanilla bean - $19

Then we added the best thing ever- Polenta Fries ($12) stacked like firewood, a total of 6 perfect rectangular logs served super hot and crispy with an aioli mayonnaise. These logs were like ""orgasms"" in a bite.

Add the Champagne and our entrees and we didn't want to leave.

So my friends - invest in the Harry's Bank of Brunch for a solid return of fun and delicious food!

Their brunch menu has been expanded and it's fantastic. The Bennies Benedict it's still they all time favorite. Bronzino was fantastic the champagne flows endlessly. Service was terrific and the manager from Ulysses Santiago Pitched in and was on his game. The shrimp cocktail is large and tasty. By far one of the best brunches in the financial district.

This place is huge but every area your seated in is comfortable. You're so tempted to order a NY Steak but the Rib Eye is by far the best cut of meat and excellent. Christopher the captain knows his wines if your a wine guy
and he's a jolly professional on all levels of dining as is the entire staff. All appetizes from the sauteed mushrooms to lump crab meat to barbecue shrimp all great. This place is not cheap especially dinner but if you split the Rib Eye which is possible the meal becomes a value if you're not coming here because it's pricey. Because it's a big space you never need a reservation and serves late.

Went to brunch this weekend with some girlfriends and it was a 10/10 experience. Attentive service, champagne was flowing endlessly and in disbelief of the price. The cost of entree covers the bottomless service. We ended up staying over 3 hours.... THANK YOU HARRYS!

Tried and true. A few words I'd use to describe Harry's would be elegant, timeless and reliable. Returning to Harry's after a long lapse was like visiting an old friend. I've a soft spot for Harry's.

Known as a steakhouse (and more), Harry's is a must visit for their killer brunches. With the exception of a few tweaks (prices and varieties of champagne), their brunches include 90 minutes of unlimited champagne. This has not changed since I first visited in 2008 and I swear our unlimited champagne  topped at nearly 2 hours.

All champagne brunches are complimentary with an entree order except soups or salads AND you must order a small carafe of juice (peach, orange, grapefruit or blood orange at $7) as an accompaniment although our other friend drank her champagne straight.

I'm not a huge champagne lover, but with the ambience and style that Harry's exudes, it is fitting. Of course you may order other beverages, alcohol or otherwise.

Service was impeccable throughout our entire brunch with several staff tending to us at different times. My friend and I ordered the Eggs Benedict with Smoked Salmon ($26) while another selected the Cacio e Pepe Spaghetti.

My dish was cooked to perfection--delicious and a filling portion. We all agreed that we were beyond satisfied with our meals and the time we spent there to have a holiday brunch. Cozy and classic. My kind of ambience.

I'd like to return to Harry's more often for brunch and dinner (I've been in the past) but for now, highly recommending this gem on Hanover Street.

I went with coworkers for a lunch at Harry's and thought the food was pretty good. The service was a bit slow but It does get crowded so I would suggest making a reservation if you're going with a group.

For the table, we ordered the Jonah Crab Cake, Baked Clams Genovese, Prosciutto di Parma, and House Smoked Canadian Bacon.

My favorite was the House Smoked Canadian Bacon because it was cooked just right. It wasn't too oily or dry and came in a pretty good portion. It was really quite tasty.

All of the other apps were pretty average but the Jonah Crab Cake was better than most other places. It was lightly fried, had a good amount of crab meat, and came with a nice remoulade sauce.

I ordered the Hanger Steak and appreciated how it came in three separate pieces. The steak was cooked medium rare plus and was really easy to cut into. The outside and inside were cooked just how I like it.

I returned to Harry's for dinner without a reservation this past week.  While it was louder than usual/preferred, this was due to the private party next door which is simply an unfortunate reality of dining at this time of year in many establishments.  Despite the private party, the host was able to find us a quieter table tucked away in a really cool glass enclosure separating the bar from the main dining area.

We were only there for drinks and snacks, but every component far exceeded expectations.  The Oysters Rockefeller were delicious, cheesy with a healthy amount of spinach, and finished off by the spritz of lemon from the wedge on the plate.  The French Onion Soup (which is called Onion Soup Au Gratin at Harry's) was the highlight of my guests' trip to NYC (which also included meals at The Fulton and Delmonico's) despite the fact they only smelled it.  Needless to say, to some, the onion soup is phenomenal.  The hanger steak was cooked as ordered and was flavorful.

I have to include a nod to the wine list for including a pinot noir from Alsace by the glass (in addition to the usual Willamette Valley); it's always fun to try two wines from the same region back to back.

Thanks for the reliably delicious meal!

I stopped by Harry's for brunch this past Sunday.  Located in the basement of an older building on the corner of Stone Street, Harry's makes up for its subterranean seating with a classic interior with a modern twist.  Dark woods, with a fun and unique center piece lighting and private lockers with VIPs' liquor I assume, the interior feels as if it can fall on both the more formal or the more casual side depending on your needs for the meal.  We were promptly seated around noon on a Saturday, and informed that the restaurant has recently expanded its hours to include Sunday as well.

Our server was very attentive and personable, and offered us complimentary sparkling water (which can run you $8 a bottle at other establishments) shortly after we were seated. One of the biggest draws here is the complimentary hour and a half of sparkling wine, which one should most definitely supplement with a juice of your choice.  We went with blood orange for this visit, and the tartness was a great accent to the sparkling wine (we'd previously ordered the peach nectar during a previous visit, and while good, the peach puree or pulp ended up rising to the top of the glass, making the drink appear unappetizing).  Our server was very prompt with the refills of the sparkling wine, which is much appreciated compared to other establishments.

As a sucker for corn beef hash, I opted for this entree for my meal. Our server assured both me and my girlfriend that the meal came with home fries, which turned out to be a mistake.  As noted in other reviews, it comes with a little side salad that, without more, will leave you hungry.  Once our order of home fries arrived (after we had finished our meal) they were fresh and delicious, and honestly one of the highlights of the meal.

While I understand the $24 price tag builds in the ""complimentary"" sparkling wine, the portions of the corn beef hash were a little disappointing.  Served in a tower like a tartare, the corn beef could use some crisping before service, and the eggs, while runny, were bordering on under-cooked, with the egg whites still retaining some clear portions.  Further, if it was spread out on the plate a bit more, both eggs could fit on top of it, making it feel a bit more like a composed bite, rather than a tower of corn beef with a handful of salad and some sliced toast.  Lastly, to the point about the toast, the word ""biscuit"" is thrown around liberally.  the corn beef hash does not come with a biscuit; it comes with quartered toast.  Similarly, the meal does not start off with a biscuit, it is slices of raisin bread with a strawberry jam.  Neither the toast nor the raisin bread were bad, but don't raise my expectations for a biscuit unnecessarily, as its an unforced error in the customer experience.

Lastly, when we asked for our check, our server made us feel somewhat awkward since we were asking to pay before the end of our complimentary sparkling wine time period.  He was very personable and friendly, just don't try and question why we're trying to get the check.

I'm certain I'll be back at some point, especially if the goal is a boozy brunch in the neighborhood, but there is certainly room for improvement around the edges of an otherwise solid brunch.

Brought a VIP client here. Place is warm and comforting. Service was meh. Could have been more attentive.  We ordered NY strip, ribeye, scallops, baked clams steak tartar, Caesar salad, soup, fries, asparagus and broccolini dessert, wine cocktail, etc.  Bill was $500

Every dish was very  average and can't believe their fries was a disgusting soggy mess. This is elementary and I thought it was completely unacceptable that they could not even get the fries right.

And I  ordered my  ribeye medium rare and it came medium.

At this price point, I had expected so much more.  I do not expect to return.

This review is based on their weekend brunch.

Food: I ordered the steak and eggs which was amazing! You know the steak has to be good because it is a steakhouse! Though some of the entrees were a bit pricey, that's the price to pay for quality meat!

Drinks: Unlimited bubbles for 1.5 hours with entree purchase is such a great deal! You can add mixers for about $5 more which is great if you love mimosas or bellinis.

Service: The service was on-point! The staff were constantly making rounds making sure our champagne glasses never go empty and the food came out very quickly. I was surprised how attentive and quick they were at filling our glasses!

Vibes: Very classy and upscale vibe which is great if you want to impress your date or even if you have friends coming over!

Overall, great value for the brunch with superb waitstaff and delicious food!

It's been decades since I last had dinner at Harry's, forgot just how enjoyable a meal they offer.

I was professionally greeted and seated early and my drink was delivered promptly and expertly prepared.

My bone in ribeye was tremendous!

Absolutely a great meal!!

The second star was gained entirely due to the professionalism of the manager of Harry's and the wonderful bus boy who picked up my horrible waiter's (Enrico FYI) slack. Enrico spilled champagne over our table without saying sorry or bringing a towel. We were left to eat on a sticky wet table. This was the kind of meal where I kept an open note of bullet points on my phone about how horribly awry things went.

To start our table wasn't ready when we arrived- which ok New York brunch at 1 pm on Sunday is par for the course. We went to the bar then and ordered espresso martinis. The bar service was slow so we ended up heading to our table before the martinis were ready- also fine and normal. However 20 minutes and a reminder to the bus boy (again the waiter was a mere mirage for the meal) to get them and they came without baileys, again preference but I was shocked when I was charged 14 dollars per shot of baileys on top of a 16 dollar martini. I know it's New York- but I've never paid 30 dollars for a drink that didn't come with gold or a lobster tail attached.

We were served our first champagne at 38 minutes into a 90 min time limit for the champagne brunch. Which yes, is 7 minutes short of half our entire allotted time. Also note here, we asked for blood orange and got what I'm pretty sure is Minute Maid standard OJ.

They also were out of the steak and eggs by 1 pm. Also out of bread. Since we didn't get a drink until 38 min in, we had ordered a side of hash browns and fries to put something in our stomachs.

What ended up happening though is that the first round of champagne came 2 min after our martinis and our  entrees within 30 seconds of that. Ignored for the first forty minutes and then two drinks and entrees at once. Horrible timing for a leisurely meal.

I honestly was excited for some good ole red meat at Harry's- you know as it is a steakhouse. They were out of the steak and eggs so I needed up going with Waygu burger- 27 dollars on the menu. Tolerable price for Waygu, although I'd argue the impossible burger at BK lounge is just as good as Harry's Waygu. It was a VERY chewy Waygu.

All in all, if we had a better waiter maybe would have been a better meal. I'll never be over the 30 dollar martini but the manager was a true professional and the bus boy saved the day on filling up the champagne.

Pic attached of the Waygu and the bun that looks like it was drenched in a port wine before hitting my burger.

2 stars only  because the manager took off the 30 dollar martinis and the bs OJ off the bill as a consolation.

Harry's has a bottomless brunch that you just can't beat ..... bottomless bubbles INCLUDED with an entree? Incredible! But Harry's advertises this deal nowhere, letting their marketing travel by word of mouth.

Disclaimer though: do not come here expecting a rowdy boozy brunch. If you want to listen to loud music and dance on the tabletops, take yourself somewhere else. You can tell even based on the the cozy dark interior and warm decor, that Harry's doesn't want that scene and neither do its other diners.

Now for the brunch itself... I strongly suggest ordering a juice for you and your crew for an extra couple bucks to help you down that champagne. My group of 8 ordered just two and that was perfect to add a splash of flavor to every glass. The champagne started out not all the bottomless and was a little slow, but then the food came and the continuous pours came with it. The food was great! I went with the eggs benedict because I can't see that on the menu and NOT order it. My meal was great, but the only negative was that my poach eggs were cooked through :(:( couldn't get that goooood fork-in-the-middle-tap-tap-yolk-runneth-over-onto-everything with a hard yolk.

Regardless of overdone poached eggs, I will definitely come back to Harry's. Probably with my family too. And for dinner. Brunch again. Yeah, I'll come back again and pay $28 for many glasses of champagne and eggs bennie.

I was in the city last week with two colleagues and we had dinner here on a Monday night, rather early. We had our choice of tables, and the service was outstanding from the start.

The old school ambiance was delightful and made even better when the service was also very old school. Our server recommended a number of appetizers and they were all outstanding - especially the tuna crudo.

Each of us enjoyed the evening's fish special - halibut on mushroom risotto with some sort of truffle reduction. It was nothing short of perfect. We had the green beans as a side dish and they were so fresh and a nice combination of warm yet still crisp.

There was no room for dessert after all of that terrific food, but I'll be back and will have dessert next time.

I am convinced there is not a better bottomless brunch in town. Upscale environment, really great vibes, good food, great service, bottomless CHAMPAGNE for 90 minutes, at a truly unbeatable price.

Just want to reemphasize that this is a bottomless CHAMPAGNE deal - what? Harry's is the answer to all my prayers and the internet memes of mimosas that are made with 99.9% champagne with a singular drop of orange juice.

I've been to a handful of ~$35 bottomless brunches around town, and I have never seen a deal like Harry's. You only pay for the price of your food. I had a delicious $18 breakfast sandwich, which came with bottomless champagne....unheard of in New York. The other dishes looked great as well, and the complementary breads were delicious as well.

It was really easy to make a reservation here. It was one of my friend's birthdays, and our party of 12 was able to get seated in a semi private area of the restaurant.

It's also a stone's throw away from Stone Street, so take advantage of your trek to FiDi!

Can't speak to the lunch and dinner menu, but I highly, highly, highly recommend for bottomless brunch.

Photo of Harry's - New York, NY, United States. Breakfast sandwich

Preface: I was taken here on a date, and my review is based on the service and the food as both were a disappointment.

Ambiance - This place has an amazing ambiance. It really was cozy, dimly lit, and embraced this gatsby-like vibe. The centerpiece in the main dining room is very eye-catching, and the decor in both the bar and the dining areas complimented very well.

Service - In general, it was very obvious that the management and the service staff were very inexperienced. The hostess kept apologizing trying to find our reservation when the dining room was only half full. When we were seated, our server was muttering the specials, and we really couldn't hear what he was saying. The serving technique itself from serving dishes to just refilling water was not smooth - the inexperience showed. The salmon tartare that we ordered was served tableside and mixed at the table. The server was clearly struggling with the two spoon mixing technique and it was really awkward.

Food - Probably the most disappointing factor here. None of the food was outstanding. I ordered the Filet medium rare. When I cut into it, it was charred so much on the outside and a medium at best on the inside. I asked to have it refired and it was taken away from my table. The manager proceeded to bring me back the overcooked steak and tell me that this was their standard of medium rare and they could refire one at rare if thats what I wanted. I have never experienced such pushback from management - and it was honestly insulting because it was so clearly not a medium rare.

Anyways - maybe would return for a drink, but wouldn't eat again here.

This has been one of my Dad's favorite restaurants for years. Went with my parents today for brunch, and I have to say it's the best brunch I've had in Manhattan (and I've had a lot!).

If you can get passed eating brunch in a dark-ish steakhouse-like  atmosphere, there was absolutely no wait on a Sunday morning, fantastic service and delicious food. Oh, and did I mention all you can drink champagne INCLUDED with entrees for 90 minutes? Take that Sarabeths, The Smith, (insert popular brunch destination here).

My brother and I ordered Steak and Eggs, and the portion was bigger than average, and everything on the plate was done perfectly. Both my parents got variations on Eggs Benedict and they were very happy. We also ordered coffee and dessert, everything was good. Highly recommended! I will definitely be back.

What a gorgeous gem! Absolutely amazing service and food to match. Dining solo? No problem. I sat in the bar area at a table with comfy club chairs. Cocktails totally on point Dinner INCREDIBLE.

I cannot say enough about how lovely this place is.

Came here for lunch with a large group. Food was very good. The soup, the appetizers the entrees all very good. We had lobster bisque, crab cake, onion rings, lobster, cocktail shrimp. Not one complaint. The steak was nice and tender came out perfect temperature. The salmon was not over cooked, the lobster fried rice done well. The deserts was all very good. The chocolate cookie with ice desert was top notch and def recommend. Atmosphere was good.

Only complain we had from our group of 25 was that the squid ink pasta was way to soft. The pasta broke the second the fork picked it up.

We all give this place a 4 star

I've been going to Harry's since it was an old man bar in 1992. I have a lot of respect for Harry and his restaurant empire.

This was first time having brunch there.the hostess sat us in a nice corner table. Our waiter was odd. He had hard time enunciating words and clearly communicating the sparkling wine with brunch arrangement. They basically give you a bottle with brunch - but they complicate that by instead just a continual 90 min pour. Problem with that is relying on service which was spotty.

The blood orange juice was a great accompaniment to the champagne. We ran our of juice so I decided to opt for white peach. They delivered yellow peach puree to the table. It tasted awful. I mentioned it to the hard to find waiter on my way back from the bathroom and he barely acknowledged it and said he'd send the manager. Shes comes over to argue with me that it is white peach (bright yellow/orange) in color because that's what the bottle says.

Anyway, they could have just offered to get me another blood orange but they insisted instead on arguing about it. No resolution, basically tough sh*t. Shockingly unprofessional. I left the drink the drink on the table and left the restaurant pretty irritated.

Not going back.

Well worth every single penny!

I know it's old school, but that's OK. (Actually makes it better, in fact.)

Easily the best bottomless brunch in all of NYC. (The Eggs Benedict are my hubby's favorite -- simply perfect every time. Me? I'm all about the salmon tartare. Sooooo good!)

(Speaking of bottomless, spring just a little extra for the Bellinis with brunch. OH MAH GAH.)

Simple but elegant ambience.
Consistently professional table service.

Just wonderful.

The Summary:

Atmosphere - 3/5
Neighborhood - 3/5
Food - 3/5
Drinks - 5/5
Inclusivity - 3/5
Experience - 4/5

The Story:
Classy space with a fratty crowd. My biggest compliments here were the staff who were nice and attentive, and the bottomless brunch. The rate they keep the drinks going is where you get the bang for your buck.

I had an omelette, which came with toast and some potatoes. It was satisfying, but I could easily have found the same quality at a diner. I can't speak to the quality of the rest of the menu, but overall it was overpriced. Come here if you live in the neighborhood and want to experience the atmosphere with a group, otherwise I'm sure there are other options.

Wow - just had a fantastic meal here!!!

Let's start with the food. We started with a buffalo burrata, which the chef split for us without us even asking. It was delicious. So light and creamy. Then we shared the New York strip steak and potato pur√©e. Cooked medium, the steak was flawless. The char on the outside was perfect and it was just fantastic. The potato pur√©e was great as well. Then the cookies and cream for dessert is a cookie skillet with ice cream. SO GOOD!

Now the service is on a whole other level! We came by because we read on Eater that the restaurant just re-opened after undergoing over $1M in renovations. It looks gorgeous and the service was really above and beyond. Our waiter was amazingly hospitable and personable. I would return just because of the service but the food was fantastic as well so I will be back!

This is a great place close to my office. A little on the pricey side, but the food has always been consistently good, so I always go back. I've had plenty of different menu items. The burger is really good. So is the French dip sandwich, crab cakes and the steak is also done well. I'm a sucker for good French onion soup and it's delicious

Harry's is a must for brunch, especially if you live in the area! If you're looking for a bottomless drink deal in an upscale establishment with good food, service, and nice looking people then this is the place to be. Although we didn't opt for the unlimited champagne, we did have a couple of their delicious Bloody Marys. They start you off with complimentary breakfast breads & jam which were all yummy. We each had the steak & eggs - everything was cooked perfectly. We then split a slice of their lemon meringue pie to finish it all off.

Looking forward to coming back again for brunch or even dinner!

I am only giving it two stars because the shirley temple and hangover steak = delicious.

Bizarre occurrence when I went with my boss and other coworkers.  I wanted to order my steak without the asparagus or potatoes.  I asked the waiter if I could sub for fries.  He seemed hesitant.  I told him that I could just order fries separately.  However, he decided to ask me questions about why I wanted fries and not asparagus.  He said specifically, ""So you don't like asparagus?"" I replied that I did, but wanted fries today.  He kept on going about that asparagus. Then he said ""so no potatoes either then?"" ... I told him no. He looked frustrated.  He was getting louder and everyone at the table could hear.  I was embarrassed.  All of my coworkers were able to order without any additional questioning.

My boss broke the silence and said - ""Wow! He was very aggressive!""  ""Steak frites is not that hard..."" Glad I wasn't the only one who thought that....

When my food came, guess what came with it? Asparagus. His explanation... ""I forgot to put it into the computer that you didn't want it.""  Don't believe that one bit.  Got a tiny thing of French fries.  Whole experience rubbed me the wrong way.

I don't understand what's so difficult about me wanting fries?!

Won't be back.

If you are looking for a place with good bottomless brunch, this is the place for you. Drinks are not premixed so you have the freedom to drink it how you prefer. The food was delicious. I had the steak and eggs. Steak was cooked to perfection. The rest of the people at my table also liked their food. Everyone enjoyed their time. Customer service was good. Price is not on the expensive side nor cheap. But for what you pay, you will get your money's worth.

Came here for dinner and the service was phenomenal. The food did take a while to come out but definitely was worth the wait. Our porterhouse was slightly under seasoned and more on the rare side but the meat was absolutely delicious and of high quality. Would definitely return here for that delicious lobster bisque!

A friend of mine recommended this place for Saturday brunch and man of man it was an amazing spot! She totally nailed it for picking the spot.

We were seated in a nice booth area, enough room for all 4 of us to enjoy eating and drinking. The bottomless champagne with our peach nectar juice was amazing.

We all pretty much ordered the same thing- steak and eggs but just different version of eggs. My eggs were scrambled with cheddar cheese. The plate came with delicious hash browns and toast. It was so much and it was soooooo good.

For dessert, we had the Creme br√ªl√©e which was just right! And the warm chocolate cake. I thought both were yummy.

I don't know how much champagne we had.... our waiter was very attentive, kept all our glasses filled... never letting it go empty.

The atmosphere was amazing! Service and food was delicious and I can't wait to come back for another brunch date!

Came here for a company holiday party and I've got to say their beef is pretty good. It's very tender but a little on the saltier side. I loved their mashed potatoes. It's not too thick and super creamy where you don't need gravy to give it any flavor. Not the best steakhouse but it is still pretty good. Would definitely come back to try some other dishes that they have

Came here for a girl's trip brunch, and from food to service it was a great experience. The atmosphere was high end and food was delish. Unlimited free champagne during brunch hours (with any entree purchase). All the girls left happy!

Delicious local brunch spot.

Wait was a little long - popular so be patient!

We did takeaway and sat in the park across the road, enjoying the weather. Takeaway menu had solid options.

Food was quick and satisfying. Recommend!

Walter's is a gift from God. When normal life returns, I urge you to experience their ambience and STELLAR customer service, but in the meantime enjoy your Caviar delivery orders.

I ordered the burger and fries first, and everything was a dream. Their fries are magical in a way that really makes you understand what separates chefs from cooks. All of their food has been carefully thought out, and it shows. I assume they must have multiple steps to their fries, because the closest I've gotten to this is Minetta Tavern. The 2nd time I got this delivered the burger was still good but less magical. So I got the chicken next....

BAAAAYYYBEEEEE!!!! The spices they add to the honey for dipping your chicken in just... I mean it makes me want to cry tears of joy. ALSO they read the delivery notes, because I needed 2 in my life to properly experience my Nirvana. The chicken is super crispy and good too, but combined with the honey it's a MASTERPIECE! The mashed potatoes are decent too, it's just that beside the chicken there is no competition. Just save all of your calories for the chicken, because it's that good.

Anyway, Walter's has become my go-to spot during this pandemic. Their hours are reliable, they're super fast, and their quality is consistent. I can't tell you how much joy they've been bringing to me, and thankfully by limiting the bites of mashed potatoes I'm down 10 pounds even while stuck in the house eating well on weekends

Charly the manager was a true gem to making our experience at Walter's beyond great. The servers, Omar and Luis also was very attentive to serving our needs. The food was divine and what they all recommended, we ordered. Thank you for the relief during these covid times. It had been the only enjoyable dining out almost back to normal experience we had in the longest. Much needed. Thank you Charly, Omar, Luis and the rest of the team. Great job on management on Charly's part!

Brought my sister there for the first time and we left the place in a heavenly food daze like walking on clouds. We started off with the popular artichoke dip, lentil soup,  tuna salad, saigon sandwich, and finished off with their scrumptious key lime pie and flourless chocolate cake! All this was highly recommended by Riki + Charly whom are two of the very best servers I've had when eating at Walter's. Even the runner, Luis was specially attentive to filling up my teapot of hot water and our water jug.  Cutomer service's charming smiles  double the stars of the food! Sister and I left there very stuffed and satisfied! Will most likely bring friends there! ! :)

I absolutely loved the food that they serve there! One of the best burgers I have tried in a while.

Charlie was more than a gentleman! His services were impeccable and always on top of us by making sure we were pleased.

I highly recommend anyone who wants great food and have an amazing staff to help provide that!

We came on a quiet night just before the restaurants closed for dine in customers. The service was great, the drinks were delicious, and we ordered enough food to keep the kitchen a little busy.

My favorite thing to order here is the Bar Steak. It's a flank steak served with Chimichurri and horseradish sauce. Flank steaks are one of my favorite cuts, and I love the Chimichurri sauce with it. I'm a huge French Fry fan, and the fries served with this dish are the best eva.

This is a really great neighborhood restaurant in Fort Greene. I'm already dreaming of the steak...

Amazing service and food, but the mosquitoes took me out. I will likely do a drive by to get their special meatballs and the coconut pie again. Both delicious! But one note is less cheese on the meatballs perhaps. It seemed like too much for the dish and overwhelmed the flavor of the meat.

4/5 --Love the lunch vibes!

Sat at the bar 2 of us, cousin visiting from out of town. It's always a fun vibe here. The restaurant is generally always busy.

We had a bottle of rose and 2 extra glasses, side order of fries , shrimp cocktail and dried rub chicken wings.

The chicken wings were my favorite! Man is it tough to find good wings in the city. I still stand by Rochester and Buffalo having the best wings. The skid was crispy while the meat was moist and cooked all the way through. Loved their seasoning. Delicious! Can't wait to have that again!

Everything else was good too but can't really mess up shrimp cocktail. I guess you can fail on fries but their fries are delicious!

It was a nice afternoon to have a bottle, few drinks and snack. We'll have to go back for a full on meal!

This is in regards to their Walters To Go Takeout experience.

This evening we ordered two Walter Burgers to-go and let's just say I'll wait until they are opened for dine in. I feel bad for writing this review because I know small businesses are struggling, but I really couldn't eat this at all. This is my first to-go order and never have I had a burger this inedible.

First, we asked for medium rare, but we got rare burger patties that were still raw, pink and mushy. Second, the way it's packaged to-go is not ideal. The plastic container trapped all the heat and made the burger bun completely soggy from the condensation. I've had better luck with fast food burgers. I wished they would at least separately wrap the burger with paper, instead of packing it along with the fries.

Outside of take-out, their Walter burgers dining-in are fantastic. If you do decide to order take out, please keep the above in mind.

Came here at 6pm on a friday with a reservation. Bar was filled and only a couple of tables empty. Small cute place, which we wanted to try for a long time. We've been a couple of times to Karasu which is the speakeasy japanese bar in the back.

Walters like Karasu is kind of expensive but the food is excellent. And the food came out in 5 minutes of ordering it!  And happy hour house cocktail for 7 dollars was great. The one today was rye, simple syrup, bitters. Simple but so good. My boyfriend ordered the fried chicken and I tasted a bit. It had a great crunchy crust with lots of flavor and the chicken was moist and delicious. Best fried chicken I've had in a while. The honey sauce pairing is interesting, I think it has some Asian flair. There are chili flakes in it plus I think some orange because when I dipped the chicken in it, it reminded me of chinese orange chicken.

I got the French dip sandwich with both cheese and onions on it. It was a good sandwich, I wish it had a tad more meat and that the cheese and onions weren't a dollar each extra since usually that dish is served with them on it already. I subbed the garlic mashed potatoes for French fries and im glad I did. The mashed potatoes were so yummy, rich and creamy. And a good garlic flavor that wasn't too overpowering.

I definitely think the fried chicken dish is the best value. Large portion and delicious.

Also the wait staff were nice and polite but 4 times came by asking us to take our plate away when we clearly were not finished. And as soon as our credit card came back and we signed the receipt it was taken away. I didn't notice the same rush treatment for the family next to us. So it was odd.

While i loved the food and cocktail I knocked off a star for the higher prices and feeling rushed as we ate.

Was there last week for brunch. The chicken and waffles were as good as I remembered and decided to also have 3 oysters since I hadn't had any in a while. Everything was great! The staff are all wearing mask and the outside seating is spaced out sufficiently.

I am new to exploring the Fort Greene area and decided to try out Walters for a late dinner with two of my friends. Upon arrival we were seated right away and greeted by a very cheery waitress who proceeded to provide us with the special for the evening which was a burrata salad. Thank God we were immediately informed because this special was the highlight of the evening.

When it arrived it came with a lovely array of roasted vegetables and then we proceeded to ask for bread to dip with. The waitress provided us with a sourdough loaf as well as a baguette. Obviously the carbs were amazing and came with delicious olive oil.

For my entree, I ordered the fried chicken. I will say that I thought the breading on the fried chicken was a little thick but the chicken was cooked to perfection and the hot honey was a great complement. Overall I think I'd like to come back and experience their happy hour and brunch!

Came here for a drink with a friend (without reservations). Turned out you definitely need a rezzie for the back room speakeasy on a Saturday night. Luckily we were able to grab a seat at the main bar at the front of the restaurant. Cocktails were decent. Great ambiance.
I'd return to try the food.

In 2012 I went to Walters on a first date with someone I met on OKCupid. I had never had raw oysters, and he was determined show me how good they were. I fell in love with the oysters, and a few month later realized I had fallen in love with the man who showed them to me. 8 years, a few thousand miles, and many many oysters later, me and that someone are happily married, living on the opposite coast with our small dog and 10 billion house plants. So thank you Walters for the amazing oysters! If I hadn't liked them, who knows where I'd be?

Walter's is a small but comfortable place,  four of us stopped in for breakfast one Sunday AM.  We were lucky enough to be seated quickly.
Service was good, our coffees came out quickly, and our food followed quickly as well.
All four of us opted for omelets.  Portions were good, pricing was what you would expect in NYC.  The food was good, not necessarily great. Nothing really special about it, but it did the trick.
I'd go back to Walter's again while in the area, mainly because of the good service.

Drinks are fine, but don't order the empanadas with your drinks. They're pinky size and cost $6. And it's only 2 per order.

Offering brunch oysters is almost bribery. Little Shems & Wellfleets made my freezing cold morning that much happier. Oysters come with cocktail sauce and two mignonettes, all of them are low key, the oysters shine.

I ordered black tea and an omelette with andouille and pepperjack, it comes with a hash brown and lightly dressed greens. The hash brown was delicious, crispy on the outside and softer on the inside. They also serve their omelettes French style, meaning the fold of the egg is thinner, much more delicate, and there is no browning. I think this is the superior way to serve omelettes :)

I will say the seats by the door do get cold in the winter. They have two doors and a thick curtain, really there's only so much you can do when it gets as cold as was the day I came. Luckily they have hooks for all your winter spread both at the bar and along some of the walls.

The painted white tin ceiling and beautiful floors give the impression that the space has been here awhile and is being well cared for. Great atmosphere, friendly, attentive service even when it was busy!

I've never met Walter, but I have to assume he's a great man. In fact, I'd vote for Walter for president (he might be the only one not running right now).

You heard it here first. I'm throwing my support behind the Walter/Fried Chicken ticket for 2020.

Politics aside, this is the restaurant that I would aspire to, if I were ever to own a restaurant. They offer American staples that are well-executed and flavorful; the food is beautiful because they are hearty portions that are unpretentiously delicious, not because they were plated with tweezers.

It is both classic and classy, and still casual enough to be a good choice for any occasion. Walter's is the ideal place for a lazy brunch, an oysters/cocktails/deviled eggs date, a celebratory dinner, a weekday lunch with someone else who is blowing off work, and just about anything else I can think of.

The menu has enough on it that everyone can find something they are excited about, but limited enough that I'd eat anything on it, and I haven't had anything bad through quite a few visits.

The burger is nearly a half pound (none of this thin patty nonsense going around - although I like those too), cooked correctly, with all the things I want on a burger. They pickle their onions because it tastes good, and because they know I want onion on my burger but I still want to have friends after dinner.

The fries are perfect. I don't say that lightly.

The fried chicken comes with hot honey, as it should, and it satisfies every craving you've got. If I'm feeling healthy, there's always a tasty fish on the menu (steelhead trout, black bass, etc.) and vegetables if I'm in a cruelty-free mood. Pasta, if I need some gluten in my life. All of this is properly cooked.

The cocktails are excellent (including the bloody at brunch), the hash browns are why you go out for food you can't cook at home in good conscience, and the egg dishes are done right.

It's not amazing for kids, but it's not so bad either (the tables are tight, so leave your stroller at home though). The staff is lovely in general, and was so sweet and helpful with any of our baby needs...if that's just because my kid is the most adorable child in Brooklyn, that's your problem, not mine.

This is the neighborhood restaurant I wish was a little bit more in my neighborhood, but I don't mind walking a little bit farther for.

Although I've been remiss in checking it out for dinner, Walter's is just about everything I'm looking for in a brunch spot. It's got:

1. A very decent Bloody Mary.
2. A surprisingly affordable and unfailingly delicious Breakfast Sandwich.
3. An excellent burger.
4. Great service, good music (can never have enough Mobb Deep in my life), and a sunny, comfortable dining room.

I apologize for the overly simplistic review, but simplicity is one of the things I like most about Walter's.

What a gem in Fort Greene! We made same-night reservations on Resy on a weekend, which was probably just luck in our favor. Based on the crowd on a Sunday night (of a holiday weekend), my guess is that you'll want to make a reservation a few days in advance if looking for a peak time.

As for the food, whoa. We started with the grilled octopus topped with chimichurri - perfectly executed. It comes with potatoes so it's an appropriately filling app. My husband raved about the french dip sandwich and said it was in the top 3 he's ever had. He literally ate everything, even the fries, without sharing :( I ordered the spicy fishermen's stew and was thoroughly impressed. They didn't skimp on the seafood - huge shrimp, mussels, clams, and crabmeat - or the spice. If there's anything I'd nitpick, I found the tomato ""broth"" to bit a bit thick and saucy, but it is a ""stew"" and not a bouillabaisse. We also ordered key lime pie for dessert and loved it. Having lived in Florida for a few years, we know a good, authentic key lime pie when we have it. This was as close as it gets in NY during winter. It was around $100 not including tip for us- we didn't get booze but FYI they do charge for soda refills.

Brunch restaurant in front of Fort Greene Park. The wait on a Saturday around 1:30 was real 20/30 mins. Me and my friend were seated right then and served by a really polite and smily server.
As soon as you are seated you are served with complimentary small muffins. A really lovely touch.
The place is small and cozy, and at the same time elegant. We had a two of their brunch specials and they were both delicious. I enjoyed very much my omelette with a side of salad and hash brown, while my friend had their burger with a mount of crispy and thin French fries.

I came in on a Saturday in September and sat at the bar, where there was an absolutely terrible smell of garbage for the duration of my meal. It smelled like they hadn't cleaned the restaurant in weeks.

The chicken and waffles was dry and unremarkable, served bone-in despite nothing on the menu stating as much. There were also no free refills on soda, which is a sign of a greedy owner desperate for margins.

I came here with my friend on a Saturday afternoon for brunch, and it was packed! This place is super popular, which makes sense since it's right across the street from Fort Greene Park BUT ALSO because it's delicious and the service is great!

The hostess kept checking in to see if our party was complete because she was holding our table, which was really nice of her and I appreciated that. I ordered the Walter's breakfast - really clean and simple, and the flavors were nicely matched. My friend got the chickpea and tomato stew - she seemed to enjoy it.

The staff is very friendly and accommodating, and we left full and happy without breaking our wallets.

Cozy little place on the corner of Fort Greene Park, great for a lively date or meeting with friends.

Fisherman's stew and French Dip were out of this world!

I believe Walter's sources bread from She Wolf but it doesn't serve bread as a matter of course when you are seated.

Don't forget about the little cocktail bar in the backroom.

Awesome spot! Classic American food with a nice ambience. Right across from fort greene park and farmers market. Service can be a little slow and unresponsive - but owner is very nice.

We stopped by for brunch due to the 4 stars ratings on Yelp. The wait was 10-15 mins for weekend brunch after 1pm. Perhaps it was the cold weather hence not a lot of people were out and about.

The cafe was packed with hipsters and a few young families - relaxed vibes. We like the big windows which brought in a lot of light. The food was a big disappointment. We got the eggs with sausage and toast; the toast was burned and the edges of the eggs were also burnt (you can see the photos). Furthermore my frittata was a sad small piece of pie and a glob of hash brown. Not visually appealing or appetizing to say the least. Suffice to say, we were surprised this cafe had such a high ratings considering the food was bland and mediocre. The burger and fries were the only highlight from this experience.

This place is a really nice local spot with a real relaxed non pretentious crowd. My friends and I sat at the bar, and the staff, was amazingly attentive
and paired wine that matched our courses perfect!! We selected more of a tapas like selection of a few appetizers. Each one was better than the next. We had oysters on the half, from about 4 different places in the United States, Canada, and Europe. Fried green tomatoes, grilled Portuguese octopus which was to die for, and lastly deviled eggs which had a really spicy kick. Overall, I really enjoyed this place.

GREAT SPOT. It has that decor that never fails, the sort of classic, dark wood white tile, almost minimalist thing that some bars and restaurants have (i.e. The Smith). High marks on that end, can't go wrong.

The bathroom situation is bad. Only one. Always a wait.

Our waiter was the nicest guy ever. Super personable, never intrusive.

We split the smoked trout, which was great with the onion and capers mixed in. And the eggs benedict (with smoked salmon) was awesome. The bread was perfect, soft yet crispy, easy to cut. The eggs were cooked perfectly, sort of well done so not too runny.

The blood mary wasn't too impressive, but what are you gonna do?

This place has been 5 stars for many years! Even that one time my appetizer wasn't on point, this team is so great, they had a great save. I love this place. I take everyone I know here because it will always be a solid experience.

Through the years I still see a lot of the same faces working here, which shows solid ownership and management. This is one of the few places that runs like a well oiled machine. They have a lovely diverse staff that caters perfectly to their diverse guests.

In this age of increasing discrimination, this place has consistently treated me and my guests like human beings and for that, I will always support this establishment!

May Walters exist forever and always!
I love this place and all it's staff!

Atmosphere: Walter's is dark and romantic around dinnertime. It can be intimidating at first, but once you get a feel for the restaurant, it quickly becomes a cozy environment that feels like a good balance between classy and comfortable.

Service: Our server was friendly and professional. He checked on us over the course of the meal and gave a fun, lighthearted tone to the more serious ambience of the restaurant.

Food: We started with the grilled octopus and had the Roasted Chicken and Fried Chicken as entr√©es. The grilled octopus was very well seasoned and did not have a chewy texture. The Roasted Chicken was flavorful and cooked well; we really enjoyed this dish. The Fried Chicken was the best value item on the menu and really filled us up. We also got the Diablo and Walter's Cooler, which paired well with the chicken.

Overall: Walter's was a good choice for dinner + drinks. You get the feeling of being in an intimate, fancy restaurant without breaking the bank. Not necessarily the first choice for a dinner date but it's definitely up there. We would love to come back and try their brunch to see the change in atmosphere!

Great place for brunch! It's tiny so you'll probably have to wait for a table, but it worth it! The service is really good and the food too, they even give you some free muffins for start, and unlimited coffee refill. Huevos rancheros were very good.

I wanted to love this place but despite the great service and tasty cocktails, I couldn't because the food was just ok. We got the pork belly & grilled octopus (2 separate dishes); the octopus had lots of flavor (and the chimichurri it came with was delightful) but was a bit over done and tough. The pork belly was tasty. For mains I got the bar steak which had 0 flavor and was pretty tough (even for medium well...could be the cut of meat...wasn't quite the flank...not sure what it was). The fries and salad were good...the fries were quite possibly the best thing all dinner. Beau had the seafood stew; he luckily was full from lunch because it looks like a hearty portion but is really a lot of broth and mot that much seafood. Maybe we chose the wrong things since Yelpers love this place...but maybe not. ((Shrugs))

Very cute little spot! Went for a Sunday brunch and it was crowded, but the wait wasn't as long as some others. We waited about 25 minutes and they were very eager to get us seated, so kept checking in to say how much time was left. The brunch menu is mixed with breakfast and lunch options. I got the burger and have to say it was really delicious. The fries were okay, not my style but others at my table enjoyed them. Service was great. The restaurant has a really cute atmosphere, but is slightly intimate. Louder and upbeat energy. Crowd was diverse and there were even a couple babies. Solid place for any meal I would imagine! Would return!

Perfect spot for weekend brunch and catching up with old friends. Located right on the corner of Fort Greene Park, you can drop by the farmers market or go for a stroll afterwards. It is small restaurant with a few booths and room to sit at the bar. They take reservations for dinner only, but we didn't have to wait long for a booth around 11:30 on a Saturday. The booths area actually pretty spacious so it feels comfortable and not crowded, despite the restaurant being so small.

Menu for brunch is pretty standard, nothing too unique. The serve you yummy mini muffins to start. I tried a spinach and goat cheese omelette. It was good, but not extraordinary, other than the huge amount of spinach it was filled with. Definitely the most spinach I've ever had on an omelette, it was almost too dense.

Besides the atmosphere and friendly service, other pluses were the large portions at a reasonable price. We all left stuffed.

I really like this place from late night drinks to Sunday brunch--this place is versatile. It's a great location, easy to get to but also far enough away from Flatbush not to feel too hyped or rushed. It's a small place so it can feel a little cramped, but ultimately everyone is sweet and attentive. The food is a little pricey, but on par with the neighborhood and it's good quality.

It always had an inviting appearance for a winter meal with a hearty Alsatian menu, string lights and a fireplace but in this COVID  winter, my new #1 criteria for places is a safe but warm outdoor dining option and this place delivered!!

They have adorable outdoor huts set up allowing parties up to 4 to sit on their own with their own heaters and air purifiers. It's honestly one of the best options in Carroll Gardens for outdoor dining on a cold or rainy night (last night was both and it was cozy and warm in the hut). They also have mulled wine with isn't on the menu but available if you ask.

The food was great. We got French union soup, tuna tartare, octopus and Brussels sprouts and everything was delicious. The service was also friendly and efficient. Would definitely recommend.

The best Escargot in New York!
If I ever see escargot on a menu, I order it. This restaurant has the best Escargot I've ever had. What a delight that they are open during Phase Two of NY's Reopening after COVID19. They are taking every safety precaution: tables in outdoor seating that are separated 6ft apart, mini hand sanitizer bottles at every table and staff that has on face masks at all times. As a healthcare provider, I saw that they went above and beyond to take every precaution. I felt safe eating here. Oh yeah, and did I mention they have the best escargot in NY? And if you get the Drunken Boat, you won't be disappointed!

La Cigogne is one of the best restaurants in the neighborhood. Great food, great drinks, great wine. Very friendly place to hang out, too. It's French/Alsatian, which means a mix of French and German. It's largely a French menu, but has German dishes that make for great comfort food, especially in the Winter (schnitzel; Spatzles (homemade egg noodle dishes)). When the weather's nice, they open the front and we love to sit on their deck. Since COVID, they've expanded their tables out front, too. We love La Cigogne.

I declare La Cigogne to be one of the best, if not the best, restaurants in the Carroll Gardens vicinity.
The past visits allowed me to try selections from their appetizer section such as the Tuna Tartare and Baked Camembert,  but I dined here two consecutive nights this week and am able to share a lot more.

First night, my friend and I shared the Alsatian Mac and Cheese, Goat Cheese Salad and La Cynara  Flatbread. Oh my word. Each dish was absolutely delightful.

The Mac and Cheese was creamy and cheesy without being overwhelming or salty. The portion was definitely shareable or great when combined with a salad which is what my friend did.
The salad included baby arugula, goat cheese, slivered Granny Smith apples and walnuts coated in a tangy lemon vinaigrette.

The La Cynara Flatbread (Tartes Flambe) was indescribably delicious. Presented on a stone board, it was thin and topped with chunky artichokes, spinach, toasted pine nuts, Fontina cheese and creme fraiche. Cut into 8 squares, this was also shareable. Definitely recommend everything I outlined.

On the second night, we chose the Alsatian Mac and Cheese and Baked Camembert as starters. Since I tried both, I knew they would be a table pleaser. Perfect winter comfort food.

For main, I selected the half roast chicken with mashed potatoes while the other selection was mussels with pomme frites.
While the mussels were given bragging rights, I was in love with my chicken. A generous portion that was so flavorful, juicy and bringing roast chicken to a new level. The mashed potatoes were creamy and garnished with a handful of crispy green beans. Outstanding. Two consecutive nights of solid, delicious and excellent food accompanied by cozy atmosphere and stellar service.

La Cigogne does everything right. And that's more than all right with me! See you soon.

I was very pleased with my first time visit to La Cigogne. I've passed by plenty but never dropped in.
Upon a Yelp search, we decided to check it out and I'm happy we did.

The restaurant has a few tables for  outdoor seating, but the atmosphere is more than inviting indoors. It resembled a quaint French bistro---very welcoming---however, we decided to sit at the bar.

With a Yelp check in, we received an entire flight of 4 different beers. Super surprised and although I don't love beer, i managed to enjoy two of the selections.
I wish I knew the bartender's name, but he was extremely helpful when asked questions and also offered recommendations.

I transitioned to a nice crisp Rose afterwards which was delicious.
As far as food, we shared a melted camembert served with a small side salad, honey and accompanied by toasted bread (about 6 pieces).
This was absolutely delicious.

I really enjoyed my experience at La Cigogne--mainly an introduction--and am looking forward to coming for dinner sometime.

The ambiance was beautiful, service was attentive and food/drinks---delicious.

Who can ask for anything more?

Love everything about this place. My sister and I went yesterday, but all of the tables were full. The manager asked us to wait a moment and he quickly setup an extra table for us! Our waiter (forgot his name) was awesome and had a lovely French accent. Ordered a few spritz', which were made perfectly. The Caesar Salad with grilled chicken was really good, as was the Norwegian (smoked salmon) Benedict. Needless to say, there wasn't anything left behind on those plates! Highly recommend you giving this place a try. I look forward to my next visit. Thank you for a fabulous outdoor brunch experience!

In the infamous words of Homer Simpson, ""mmm... pretzel bun (sic).""

Want a few more reasons to visit this neighborhood French bistro?  How about great service?  Sure, the place might be run by a team of 18 year old food & drink wizards with no adult in sight... but whatever gets the job done, right?  The name we all cannot pronounce (?) means Stork.  ""Oh that weird bird mascot and the related bird paraphernalia finally make sense,"" you say.  Mystery.  Solved.  You.  Are.  Welcome.  And finally, beer (see also, Homer Simpson).

As if I have not posed enough questions, how about this one?  Why do I have to visit an Alsatian joint to enjoy a Belgian beer with dinner in Brooklyn?  Because there aren't any Belgian bistros in this borough.  Argh!

What about the food?  The grilled octopus appetizer was fantastic!  The frisee, cranberry bean, and potato accompaniment was creative and delicious.  Bringing this all full circle, let's talk about Le Burger - which is French for the American ""hamburger.""  That pretzel bun was simply divine!  Throw on your choice of dairy (I am partial to cheddar), bacon, avocado, or mushroom - and voila.  The ground beef could have used some extra seasoning, though.  And I really miss the signature Pavel Kwak glass and stand that is the de facto gold standard as far as Belgian bistros are concerned.

""Eh, bien.""  I googled this, so I hope this is the correct usage case.   Either way, I approve!

I love the food but the cocktails are  small  with a light pour ( the smallest in the hood).  So I may have to switch up my spots.  Feels like the bottom line is more important than  the customer.

I really like this place. The drinks were amazing and I had the burger with Swiss cheese and pretzel bun. Very good food and salads fresh. I liked the drink morning high. The place is cute and cozy and there is a fire place. It's a French cafe and is so nice. I would definitely recommend this place for dinner and drinks. Nice date spot or to gather with friends.

Love love love this place! Situated on a nice quiet street with a cozy outdoor patio, it's the perfect spot to enjoy some French cuisine. Food is absolutely delicious, wine list and cocktail selection is great and service is exceptionally friendly and attentive without being annoying. Never had a bad meal here and always look forward to dining here again! Street parking is fairly easy to find even on Saturday night.

Right away, La Cigogne has ultimately become my ""restaurant-of-the-moment""- (after ditching my former fave, Bar Tabac). Everything I like is right here: innovative cocktails? This place has 'em. Style? Yep. Music? Very nice 'Chill' playlist. Plus, phenomenal prices and detailed service.

Decided on early Dinner considering we were already in the area and had wrapped up with a quick stint at the Atlantic Antic. Cigogne is low-key but with a dramatic and monochromatic design that I was really digging: Charcoal Dark Greys, Whitewashed Brick Wall by the Bar and a couple of Black walls- adding a funky touch of French chic.

Tuna Tartare starter was simple but tremendously delicious. My 'Ideal Mistress' and 'Spleen & Ideal' (or vice versa)cocktails were excellent and hit me after 20 minutes. Salade Ni√ßoise, called for mustard in the vinaigrette and swapped it for a Balsamic & Oil dressing instead...Merci! This is where attention to detail meets coming back for more! While hubby enjoyed his medium rare Steak Frites and a beer flight (not part of the Yelp Check-In offer...just a sample of one) and included a Lager (I think) spiked with a French Orange Liqueur.

Mr. French Bartender was on point the whole evening and executed our cocktails with precision!!!!!! Merci! Service was very nice and apologies for forgetting Mr. French Bartender's name, but your cocktails rock! Based on reviews here, have to agree with Cigogne not being completely full but I felt we had everyone's undivided attention- especially, for an early Sunday evening.

This is by far the most unique breed of cool and nicely-priced French restaurant I've visited in Brooklyn in a while. Bookmark Checked off! It's a very nice first impression and right now, I'm having a serious moment with La Cigogne.

French food doesnt seem to be my preference so please take my review with a grain of salt.

Embiance... Dimly lit, wooden tables, dark church pews and iron seats. Jazzy French music plays and the smell of fresh baked bread engulfs the space. It's warm and intimate. Very inviting and romantic.

Service.... Friendly, sincere and attentive. But gotta say it was a Monday with only 3 tables.

Food.... Unfortunately, here is where they lost stars from me.

They start with warm bread. It smelled like a homemade biscuit but tasted like a baguette with a slightly softer exterior. It was really good and piping hot inside so the firm butter melted perfectly. I enjoyed the bread. And that was it. The meal went down hill from there for me.

Appetizer... Camembert Roti
Baked camembert with walnuts and honey. A side salad with potatoes and toast. The cheese was greasy and flavorless (and I love cheese). There were chucks of cheese floating in oil that just coated my throat. I was so disappointed. I wanted to like it. But I just couldn't enjoy it. I Searched for the honey but could not find it. The walnuts were bland but added a bit of texture (albeit mushy). The salad was okay but the potatoes were bland as well. They had great texture though, cooked perfectly. Overall, Not a fan at all.

Main course... La Chevre...
Goat cheese, bacon and imported honey on flat bread. Meh. I kinda feel like I could make this at home. The cheese was prominent and i like goat cheese. But I felt it was too chunky and crumbly. Not really a good balance of cheese to bread. The super thin crust reminded me of matzah and I wanted more melted cheesy bits and less chunks. There was just too much cheese in most bites. (Wait, did I just write that?! What!? But I digress).
The bacon was very good, it added flavor, saltiness and texture. No fatty pieces and not over cooked. And there was a decent amount. There were hints of honey which added a nice balance in some bites but it wasn't consistent. The cheese just overpowered all the other ingredients.

2 misses and no hits. I was done. I would go back for drinks or maybe dessert but I'll pass on dinner.

4 stars for the experience we had here while we hosted a bridal shower. The bride to be really enjoyed her time here and we were quite happy that management dealt with our shenanigans during the toilet paper bride dress challenge (we did clean up after ourselves after the fact!)

The staff at La Cigogne were very attentive and provided all the help we need before the bridal shower began, during, and after. I was surprised to see how big the space was. The restaurant manager was nice enough to allow us to arrive an hour before the shower started to set up decorations and rearrange some furniture to suit the theme. For a group of 20, I'm glad this place didn't force us to go with a pre-fixed menu; everyone was allowed to select their own meal. What was a nice was that the mimosas were consistently being filled by the wait staff. As far as recommendations, I recommend ordering a bit of everything and sharing it family style since on it's own the entr√©e can be a bit much to consume for one.

Things I tried:
- goat cheese arugula salad: I really like the goat cheese and wished there was more of it
- steak tuna tartare: It was a bit under seasoned; perhaps some salt and sesame oil will do the trick here
- mac & cheese: indulgent, cheesy & heavy; 100% recommend this as a dish to share
- croque madame: indulgent and also recommend splitting this sandwich with someone; or cutting it into quarters to share amongst 4

Casual and classy, chic but rustic, La Cigogne is the perfect mash up of a French backyard with some laid back Union St. vibes. This spot is just where I wanted to be on a Saturday night. I came here to catch up with a girl friend, but this spot would be cool for a first date or casual drinks by the bar. The vibe is a real crowd-pleaser. Onto the food and drink...

You'll get a free taste of their draft Alsatian with a Yelp check-in. This taster is quite a generous pour, served in a mini mason jar. Tres chic! The beer was pretty good too... so good that I ordered another after I finished up my first.

The bread basket - is it weird that I'm writing about a bread basket? If so, I don't care because that bread basket was so bomb. The bread was hot, buttery, soft, and super fresh. Honestly, if I didn't order such a big entree, I would have finished the second roll. But I needed to save room for my main and I'm so happy I did...

The burger - LAWD. I fell in love with this burger from the first bite. Perfectly cooked beef, a super soft and buttery pretzel roll (so many carbs, YAS), and some super salty French fries that paired perfectly with my beer. This burger was also HUGE but I devoured the entire thing because I'm not a quitter.

My friend ordered the tuna tartar app as her main and she definitely enjoyed it. And I trust her. She definitely has good taste. She did choose to hang out with me that Saturday night after all.

To finish up this meal, I ordered an espresso which was perfectly strong and a little frothy. I'll admit this was a bit fancy of me, but I needed help staying awake after demolishing that monster burger. Un caff√® well earned, I think!

The service was fast and friendly. Everyone was extremely accommodating and knew exactly what to recommend.

My new favorite place in the neighborhood. Can't wait to visit again.

My mom threw my bridal shower here and had such a wonderful experience working with Damien. He was so quick in responding to all my emails that I was able to find and book this place in 24 hours! Throughout the whole planning process, he was such a great help in answering any questions I had.

We had an area in the back of the restaurant for the shower and we were able to decorate it with our own centerpieces/balloons/banners. They even provided a small table that we used for photobooth props and a guest book. It was a perfect space for a small gathering (we had 20 people).

Now, for the most important part: the FOOD. Oh. My. Word. Everything was AMAZING. She picked out the menu and everything was served family-style. She chose the goat cheese salad, tarte flambe les champignons, taste flamb√© vegetarian, french toast, mac and cheese, ratatouille, french fries, bowls of fruit, and a dessert assortment (creme brulee, chocolate brownie, apple crumble). There was more than enough food and everyone was raving about the food. My favorites were the tarte flambe les champignons and the mac and cheese - but everything was absolutely delicious. We also had orange juice/coffee/tea for everyone which came unlimited.

Overall I would definitely recommend this place to anyone throwing a party or just a place to eat! I look forward to coming back soon :)

Brought a party in from out of town to what used to be one of my favorite spots to drink.
We were having a great time until the bartender came to our table (in an almost empty restaurant) to tell us that we were being too loud.
I didn't realize we were drinking in a Library.
How embarrassing!
Do not come here with large groups OR if you are intending to have a good time.

1/30/2020Good afternoon Janine, thank you for your review. I am truly sorry regarding your experience that night. I really value our customers and their experience and after speaking to my manager, he was only trying to do his job and make sure that other customers (who actually complained to him) also enjoy their experience. I can assure you that he wasn‚Äôt trying to embarrass you or your party whatsoever and was just making sure everyone was having a lovely time. I really hope you ll take the time to review your review (as you may know, they really burst out business), and that you ll visit us sometimes again and enjoy the drinks that you enjoyed in the past. If you would like to contact me directly, my email is damien@lacigognenyc.com . Best regards,  Damien

La Cigogne has a casual yet intimate ambience with its lighting and decor.

The dinner menu was great. There were many appetising options. I landed on the red snapper and it was lightly seasoned and tasted great. The steak that my friend ordered came out medium-well, when it should have been medium-rare. We informed the staff and they rectified it immediately without question. The second dish came out to our liking. I appreciated their attentiveness to our concern. Additionally, the cocktail and drink options are great. The Clouded Sky was good. Also, the complimentary bread was delicious. I am pretty sure that I had two baskets alone.

Do not waste your time here!

My fianc√© and I made a reservation for la Cigogne yesterday for 6:30pm. We took my in-laws to celebrate my mother-in-law's birthday. We were seated at 6:37 and did not receive anything but drinks until an hour later. Cold bread came out at 7:42. When we came in there was a family sitting next to us. They left and a couple then sat down around 7, their food and appetizers were served before ours even though we had ordered way before them. There were only 3 other tables on top of ours. We complained about the delay twice, and even asked to speak to the manager. He/she never came out or showed their face.  After our food came out, my father-in-law's burger was completely burned through. We sent it back, and no one offered him a new one or checked in to see if he would like anything g else. We received a complementary dessert aa t the end of the night and the burger was taken out oof the bill, but our night was ruined. They should have had more staff and the service should have been better. We were highly disappointed.

Wonderful spot for a date with a small outdoor space, but the doors can open which brings the outdoor in. The prices are a bit cheaper, but they have a great selection of cocktails. The schnitzel here is great and definitely fresh. We tried a little bit of everything being part of a large party. Most of the flavors were good, but needed a little bit of extra seasoning. Would definitely come again though!

This restaurant came highly recommended from friends of mine that frequent the place.

My dish was below par I got the pork schnitzel, my dining partner's dish was not eatable.

He got the fig flatbread which the waiter pushed pretty hard as the entree of the day.

My review of the dinner tonight is probably not indicative of how the other dishes are.

I doubt I would return.

Please let me know.

Went here for my mom's birthday dinner and it really was a perfect, intimate, yet trendy spot for a small family dinner. Ambience was great and the waiters were very nice and helpful with their recommendations. But now let's talk business... the drinks (and most importantly) the food!
- my dad got a fresh wheat beer which he loved. My mom and I both got their most popular drink on the menu- the ideal mistress. We totally get why it's so popular! Not too sweet and just strong enough.
- the French onion soup!! The only thing missing was the view of the Eiffel Tower. Baked to perfection and deliciousness.
- the tuna tar tar was very fresh and had a tin layer of avocado on top. It was served on a bed of thinly sliced cucumbers and a side of crispy bread.
- the crab cake was good but not my absolute fave. Not sure if I would order it again just because it was a little too heavy and too fried for my taste.
- the escargot was delightful! Highly recommend!!
- we also got the thin flat bread with melted Camembert, truffle oil, wild mushrooms, and bacon. Very good but as you can tell from the description it's a little heavy (which makes it that much more delicious)
- to top everything off, we got a creme br√ªl√©e for dessert. It was delicious. Caramelized perfectly on top and rich and creamy on the inside.

Definitely coming back to dine here again! Great food, ambience, and company... what more can a brooklynite ask for?

We, a birthday party of 8 people, had dinner here on Friday the 13th, and it was our lucky day! With the rain outside, the merry fireplace was the first lovely feature. The lighting is cozy (and very forgiving to a 70-year-old lady), the intimate room is inviting, and we were actually able to hear each other during lengthy conversations!
I enjoyed my delicious Spaetzle with wild mushrooms, others had  the half chicken, steak frites, and various other spaetzle dishes, all delicious. We enjoyed some Gewuerztraminer and each others' company. The service was attentive, and the overall experience will be remembered as very pleasant. Thanks!!!

My partner and I came here to have a few drinks and appetizers while we waited for our reservation at Lucali. It's a trendy, hipster bar that has a continuous playlist of jazz music. Seat yourself style and intimate enough for dates or casual enough for a group dinner.

My partner started off with a cocktail, a clouded sky, be drunk was fresh and tasty. I ordered the Kronenbourg a crisp fresh beer that was served in a cold mason jar.

They offer a small basket of complimentary buns which is great but they were stale and flavorless. I could do without them

For food, we ordered the charcuterie board. It came with Brie, Asiago, strawberry jam, honey, strawberries, blueberries, walnuts, salami, prosciutto, and a toasted baguette. This changes sometimes so make sure you ask what selections they are serving before ordering. The board was great. I enjoyed the flavors and the way they combined. After that we shared a hamburger patty which was greasy, burnt, and lacking in salt.

Later on, I ordered the beer sampler. Almost all of the beers were overly sweet and just not my taste.

Overall this is a nice place to go for drinks and hang time with friends, family, or significant others. They played Million dollar baby on the big screen and the music is great.

I would come back for the charcuterie and drinks

Really nice space and great food. I had the salmon and quinoa and a side of ratatouille, which was good but healthy. I tasted the flatbread which was amazing, and so was the seafood spetzle. The wine was a bit pricey at $12/glass. I would definitely come back.

Yikes.  As soon as I saw the fireplace I swore this would be the romantic night of my dreams.  Add to it that it was Valentines day and I thought the night would be great! Unfortunately.... it wasn't.  Food  was ok.. service was lacking alot.

We received  a full menu and a special one for the night. After agonizing over our choices, we were ready to tell our server what we wanted.  He then tells us that it is prefixe only.    Why not tell us at the start? (The couple who came ok after us had the same thing happen to them.) The choices were not that great. We finally picked  a second  choice. The salad was literally a plate of  bitter leaves. The portobello mushroom was better.  I then had the scallop risotto which was good.  It had alot of risotto for the three scallops. The duck with plum sauce and potatoes was not a successful dish.  My favorite part of the night was the beer sampler which was free with yelp. Dessert was a chocolate mousse (ehhh) and a berry covered meringue thing (ehhh again).

The thing is the service sucked. Hard. The minute it started getting filled, they couldn't handle it.  We had to call for our server twice who still didn't come over and then we had to go over to get him.  Unacceptable!!

Won't be headed there again.  Thanks but no thanks!

It's usually really hard for me to find a brunch food that wows my taste buds.

A friend found and recommended this venue. Visited on a Saturday, got there right when they opened so no wait time and the scene was relatively empty except for another party of early risers seated nearby.
By 11a/12p, traffic was def picking up.

I already viewed their online menu (&Yelp recommendations) so I knew what the deally was.

Staff were very Friendly and they speak French so feel free to practice with them.

The decor is cozy, there is even a fire place. It was raining cats and dogs when  I visited so the fire place added extra feel of warmth.

I had the mimosa, I am actually not a mimosa fan so not sure why I even ordered it with th grp.

Highlights of the meal was the Nutella banana pancakes, the French toast and the tarte flambee brie... Yummers. Def filling for a grp of 4.

I wanted to like the Tuna Tartare but it was too salty.
We also ordered the Le Petit dejeuner coubertin but were honestly too full to give it any attention.

Overall, I would recommend. Def with a grp so you can order several items and taste a bit of what's goodm

This place is TERRIBLE. This is a complete showcase of a bad chef. I felt like I was at an episode of Kitchen Nightmares before the make over.

Sadly, I chose this place for a birthday dinner due to  arriving too late to get a decent time at Locali.

I picked this place because I like French and it had good yelp reviews. Lesson learned.

Appetizers took 30mins to arrive
Escargot : burnt to a blackened crisp
Mussels: alchohol didn't cook down correctly so basically you had over cooked mussels in unreduced sauce
Noodles: over sauced and over cooked (notice a theme?)
The steak: I asked for Medium Rare and clarified w the server that it was a warm pink. What I got instead was perfectly cooked. Haha jking, the chef is clearly not that talented. It was a grey mess. (Sad face here)

Avoid avoid avoid. Unless you like overcooked food pretending to be French food

Edit: Another example, false response from restaurant. No one checked on how our food was nor did we get a new steak.

7/8/2018Salut Tim! Thank you for your review, we hope you feel better now that you shared your experience. We did indeed overcooked your steak, and I am trully sorry about that. We still served you a new one at the right temperature and after checking up on you I had the feeling it was right, obviously not? Again, im sorry about this temperature issue. As for the ‚Äúnoodles‚Äù (spatzles), this is the way they are served in Alsace. Im from there and this is how we serve them. I dont think this was worth a 1 star but as long as you feel better ....

Have a lovely evening, or not

This is an Alsatian bistro.  The tartes flambee are a nice light alternative to all the pizza in the neighborhood.  If you're hungrier, go for the steak frites.  Share the escargot for a change of pace and you won't regret.  Lucky for me La Cigogne is in my backyard and I can go anytime.

So I was trying to find a new place to eat near by and this menu looked amazing.
I walk in and was like oh whaaaa!? This place again?
Turns out I came here a few years ago. I couldn't remember if it was good or not though. Anyway, it's a romantic dimly lit joint. We sat in the back right by a speaker playing jazzy music for this whole place to hear. That made it difficult to hold a conversation and MAYBE it was hard for the server to hear what I was actually ordering. I definitely got the wrong dish. This thing had steak and mushrooms in. Two things I don't really eat. There wasn't one pine nut in it which, I know seems weird but that's my favorite nut and I'd honestly give my left one for anything with those babies in it.
I have to say though for not liking steak or mushrooms I ate almost the whole thing. Whatever it was I ate got taken off the bill so I can't really fault them too much, but damn now I just want to eat like a cup of pine nuts.
My husband ordered a steak and purposely ordered it like nearly raw...as if he were some sort of psychic he knew they would over cook it. Guess what. They did. He still liked it.
Everyone is super nice here though. You should check it out. You might end up eating something you didn't know liked!

9/22/2019Thank you for your honest review Joey and please accept my sincere apologies. It turned out that you received the Gambrinus (slow cooked beef stew with prunes, carrots and olives) instead of the Genova that you ordered. I am truly sorry for the inconvenience, theses things should not happen at all. If you ever stop by again, please ask for myself (Damien - I took your order of French Martini and Spleen & Ideal) and I will take great care of you. Best regards, Damien

My boyfriend and I seriously love this place! We've been about 4 times now and I'm not one to repeat restaurants with as many options as we have in NYC!
The interior has a warm, cozy feel with a fireplace in the back half of the restaurant. The menu puts a lot of focus on the Spatzle and flatbread options, so we've tried several. You can't go wrong with Le Ch√®vre, we order it every time. We've tried most of the spatzles as well, and my personal fave is the Kari with chicken! Appetizers Scallops and French onion soup are top notch! They put some focus on the Mussels apps as well, but I'm not too big on Mussels so can't comment there..
Such a small detail, but I also love that they always write a joke a day in the bathroom for something to ponder over the course of dinner.

Came here to kill time while waiting for our reservation at Lucali's down the street. Got some drinks here and small bites to eat.

I got the clouded sky cocktail and really didn't enjoy it. It just had a weird medicine taste to me since it oddly combined orange with a kind of spice/cinnamon taste. It just didn't sit well with me. I switched to Riesling after that and that was better.

Escargot was good, tuna tartar was good as well, but had a little more ginger flavor than I would've liked. We also tried one of the sp√§tzle dishes that was like tiny gnocchi with mushroom and had a Mac and cheese look to it. Rich flavor, but not too heavy. Their complimentary bread was also very very good!

Came here on a Sat. morning, when they just started. At first, I thought the place is very cozy and had look of a cute bistro. But when I went it, it had quite large a good amount of seating and was bigger than I thought. The food that we got was pretty good. Their flatbread Pizzas were good, as well as the steak tartar. Also had their duck and waffles which was amazing. The chef does the food right here. Will def come again at different times to check out the vibe of the place at night.
Def would recommend.

I'm in love with this restaurant. I was lucky enough to go here for a tasting at the Taste of Brooklyn's Food Crawl event and the servers didn't treat us any differently than a customer who was going there for dinner. No other restaurant at the food crawl did that, so it made La Cogigne stick out and I'm dying to come back here for a full meal.

My friend and i got the artisan mac and cheese, an appetizer on their menu, and the tarte flamb√©e de les champignons, which is a flatbread with mushrooms and brie. Both were delicious and they gave a pretty big amount for a tasting, which was great. I was left wanting more because both of them were soooo good.

Like I said, the server was really really nice. He let us sit wherever we want, gave us glasses of water, and checked up on us to see how we were doing. We got a full restaurant experience with great good from just a tasting event! I was seriously impressed.

I definitely recommend going here for a dinner date. The ambience is dark and romantic, and they had a pretty big bar as well. Can't wait to bring someone here for a romatic night out!

A French/German restaurant - not something you see everyday. Nonetheless, this spot took last minute reservations and had an interesting menu with something for everyone. Tuesday night and almost no one inside, so was able to secure a table for two on the patio outside.

To start off, got the Camembert frit/roti ($13) and a side of french fries ($6). Fries come in a deep fryer basket, extra thick and crisped well, just the way I like it. The Camembert dish is essentially a fondue; melted cheese in a pot with baguette slices to dip into it. The cheese includes walnuts and rosemary which added texture of the meal. For the main course, split the La schmidt flambee ($14), and the Nemrod spaetzle ($16). Flambee looks like a flatbread rectangular pizza with cr√®me fra√Æche as a base, gooey to eat and balanced well with the ratatouille. Chicken on top is a little bland, which was fine since the rest of the dish countered it. Spaetzle looks and tastes like a spicy pasta with mushrooms, onions, and raisins - solid kick that was a nice reprieve from all the creamy dishes. Cocktails and beer here are strong and on point as well.

Service here is solid. Our waiter went through the menu as much as possible and kept the water filled. This is a great place for a dinner date as it's not a bad walk to the riverfront afterwards.

I cannot believe I never posted a review until today because Vinegar Hill House is my (and my husband's) absolute favorite restaurant. For years now, it's been our go-to celebratory restaurant and we always look forward to their impeccable service, delicious cocktails and incomparable food -- it's seriously the best chicken you will ever eat! Finally, as someone with numerous dietary restrictions, I want to add that I am amazed that they always manage to accommodate me, even though the menu is so small. We cannot wait to visit the restaurant again as soon as the social distancing measures are lifted.

On a beautifully chilly Saturday morning we decided to venture to Vinegar Hill, Brooklyn. Upon walking in your greeted by the hostess asking for reservations or taking names. The environment was warm and eclectic; there was interesting lights and so many geodes(really cool rock formations look it up!)  all over the place. I felt very relaxed. The noise level was pretty calm, and it did have ample sunlight for pictures.

NOW for the main event! THE PEAR SOURDOUGH PANCAKES make me wanna cry from excitement! They were so warm and sweet and tangy. The pancakes were the butteriest and fluffiest I have ever eaten. I have been searching for pancake home and I'm never leaving. BEWARE they switch to apple every other week so call ahead to see if pear is on the menu. I was so upset they only serve one, but the guy next to me ordered two!!! I know for next time, its soo good and one leaves you wanting more two is the best number.

My brunch mate ordered the shrimp and grits and it was really good. I do feel that the shrimp could be bigger and have a more of a gravy but it was ok. The grits were the main attraction in my book. The were a course grind, full of that seafood flavor,and perfectly cooked.  The omelette.. was ehhhhhh.. underwhelming and could've done without. It needs to be improved. The egg is perfectly cooked it was fluffy and creamy. I just wanted more from the mushroom and goat cheese

Overall this was a great experience and i will be back for the double stack of Pear Pancakes

This place has been on my bucket list for a few years now and finally got there with 2 friends and a couple
Of cousins. The neighborhood is quiet you can find parking in the street
I have to say I was a bit disappointed. I don't like being charged for bread and butter, however it was amazing.
I also don't like being charged for sparkling water although I know it's a ""thing "" now with hipster joints.
The chicken liver mousse was awesome and probably my favorite dish however it was a tiny portion. The flavor was outstanding and the crostini was perfect. The octopus was also delicious but a really small portion

Main dishes- 2 had port chop which came sliced and rare. Delicious
Fish- hake - was told it was good. It came in a broth
I had the rigatoni with lamb Ragu. Also good but sauce was a drop overwhelming and tasted a bit salty

Desert- we had 1 of each-chocolate cake with the cream cheese topping. The cake was a little dry.
Panna cotta was good but extremely small portion

Just on the expensive side and we didn't even have drinks!

I'd heard great things about Vinegar Hill House and finally got the opportunity to come here last night for a work dinner. It's very cozy inside, and has that great quiet, laidback neighborhood restaurant feel. That said, I do not recommend for a dinner with your coworkers, as it's pretty small and you will essentially be sitting on top of each other and elbowing your neighbor every time you need more water.

We got the bread and butter, pear and arugula salad, and the octopus to start. The bread and butter was amazing - the whole wheat bread very fluffy but hot and crisp on the outside, and the butter had a slight sweetness to it. However, I cannot recommend ordering the bread if you're the one footing the bill, because they give you four small pieces of bread for $6. I get that New York has embraced charging for bread now, but $6??? I'm sneaking a baguette in my purse next time. Salad was decent, but forgettable. The octopus... meh. It was very tender but the sauce had an odd flavor and didn't seem to pair well with anything else on their menu. I am still annoyed I let the waiter lead me astray on that one instead of getting the chicken liver mousse, which I've heard rave reviews about.

For dinner, we had the cast iron chicken and the famous pork chop. As someone who usually avoids getting the chicken option at all costs (so many dry, sad, bland chicken breasts out there in this world), I was pretty impressed by the cast iron chicken - it's hot and crisp, a giant portion, and the meat is very tender. That said, be prepared to just eat chicken. I expected this to come with a few carrots or roasted potatoes, or something, but it's really... just chicken (I mean, there is an onion in the skillet, but come on). Which is very good! But not entirely satisfying to eat on its own. The pork chop is another fairly large portion, which comes on a bed of cheddar grits. I had a bite of this, and as someone who doesn't usually love pork chops (are all pork chops inherently dry, or was my ex just not that good at cooking them?), I was impressed here too.

We also got the sweet potato, which is roasted and topped with a generous heap of masala spices. It was good, but again, the flavors didn't seem to go with the rest of our meal, which was solidly in classic American territory.

Desserts, however, were a highlight. We had the chocolate Guinness cake and the earl grey panna cotta. I'm not a big panna cotta person, but this one was silky and the perfect density. The chocolate Guinness cake was basically everything I ask for in a rich slice of chocolate cake.

Had some misses, but overall enjoyed my meal here and really loved the atmosphere. Good place for a casual dinner with a friend on a rainy night, or some drinks and dessert at the bar. I also want to come back and try their famous pancake for brunch, as well as check out the outdoor space in the spring!

I'd been wanting to come to Vinegar Hill House since I saw it was rated as the most romantic restaurant in New York by some hipster magazine. So naturally, I grabbed a friend and came for dinner on Saturday night. It's a small restaurant, so make sure to make a reservation. Ambiance is quaint, dimly lit, and warm. Unfortunately, the food left me unimpressed and unfull.

Bread and butter - I can't believe they charge for this. It was indeed the best butter I've had in quite some time, but they also give you such a small portion.

Hake - light, small, forgettable, bland, simple. I mean, I enjoyed it - all three bites of it - but I wouldn't say it's worth $30! The price-to-market ratio left me regretting I chose this. The portion really was laughable. The few spoons of beans on the side were good and not too buttery.

Bourbon chocolate cake - good, but so dry!

It's more of an ambiance place, for sure. I was seriously let down by my entree, to say the least. Service was alright, but they kept taking plates away before I was finished, which is so rude. If I'm paying $6 for butter, you best believe I'm going to finish every teaspoon!

Cosy interior, friendly service. This place had never been on my list to eat, but apparently it was a trendy spot to go to a few years ago, and one of my friends suggested it for a catch up dinner, so we ended up here on a Monday night.
We shared the cheese platter to start, and each had one main dish. I don't normally order cheese platters at restaurants, but it was the beginning of a cold winter, and I figured I'd have another couple of months before it would be time to get my summer body back.
The cheese platter was actually a great snack to start off with, with crackers that I've never tried the likes of elsewhere. We finished these off quickly.
For mains, I had the fish, while my friend had the pork. I don't normally like eating pork, but Vinegar Hill's pork is excellent. The fish was a bit bland, and I wouldn't recommend eating this. There are no main dish options for vegans, and just one vegetarian main dish choice.
I probably would not come back here based on the food during this visit.

My friend and I decided to go to Vinegar Hill House (which is in Vinegar Hill, Brooklyn) it's a quaint little spot in a residential neighborhood. I'm telling you now that there isn't much around, and you might even pass by the restaurant if you aren't paying attention. But, once you go inside you will blown away by the interior, which is rustic and warm. The brunch menu was also unique and versatile. I ordered the Eggs & Tomatoes, which is basically Shashuka, and it was pretty delicious. My friend ordered their shrimp and grits, and they absolutely loved it. If you've never been you have to go, especially during the summer time

So I'd like to give this a better review.  Overall the food was really well done, and on par with what I had hoped it would be.

Then came the octopus.

We were there for my friend's birthday, and the three of us were sharing all the dishes.  The octopus arrived, a sad tentacle on the plate.  It seemed kind of like a joke -- $20 for that?  It wasn't a tasting menu, this wasn't le Bernardin.  I asked the waiter if that was actually all it was meant to be and he sort of bristled as if I was being rude to ask.

I spend a lotttt of money eating out in New York, but there is a reality that restaurants cut corners all the time.  It's at times egregious given when they're asking you to pay.  If they'd wanted to be gracious they could have replaced the plate.  Even if they're short changing people who won't mention it they could have saved face with me.  But they didn't.

If it were possible to adorn this establishment with zero stars, a thumbs down, a sad face, a photo of a dumpster fire, I would happily bestow such an honor upon this establishment. Alas, one star it is.

For those reading this review who are short on time, the essence of the complaint is that this establishment is not to be trusted and management sleeps on a bed of lies, as they say.  If you have an additional 30 seconds, read on dear friend, read on.

We negotiated an agreement with the event coordinator whereby my little brother's post wedding proposal and SURPRISE dinner jubilee was scheduled to held here. The evening, family only, was guaranteed-to-be full love, happiness, and of course the occasional tear of joy (likely mine) ...all commencing at 7:30.  We would eat, we would laugh, we would drink, and we would make memories never to be forgotten.  Or so we thought.  After negotiating the price, setting the time, picking the food, and arranging for a custom ""Congratulations!"" to be written on the top of the prix fix menu, I hung up the phone thrilled, knowing that the special day is soon approaching and that our siblings and parents, flying in from around the country, would have a place to join and celebrate the happy couple.  Apparently, management had other ideas. I received an email ...""not a phone, call?"" you ask - correct, not a courteous and professional phone call... saying, and I'm paraphrasing, we're changing your start the time to be an hour earlier (mind you they know the proposal is ACTUALLY OCCURRING an hour earlier) and, oh by the way we're increasing the price.  If that doesn't work for you, ""perhaps, this isn't the restaurant for you.""  Needless to say, substantially changing the terms of an agreed upon arrangement and throwing us into a tizzy to find a new place without even the hint of an apology is abhorrent and a practice which, in my humble opinion, mandates a scathing review of what I can only describe as terrible business practices and a complete lack of concern for other human beings. And for that I offer the free advice of, ""Try to do better.""

Oh wait, dreams do come true...

I'll [try] make this short and simple. Vinegar Hill House is great! It's intimate, cozy and the food is delicious. The menu is pretty simple. (I've only been for dinner and it was a date with my boyfriend). If you're looking for a date night spot or just some yummy food and a drink with a friend then Vinegar Hill House is worth checking out.

I have to knock off one star though because of the Octopus dish. I'm not sure exactly what I imagined when I ordered it but I was super excited when I did and majorly disappointed when it arrived to the table... It was one tentacle with a couple of raw sliced vegetables next to it. Honestly it was comical my boyfriend and I just couldn't believe it was $20 for one tentacle. I think the dish needs to be revamped in someway. Might I suggest a puree of some sort, or lemon confit.. To make up for it we did order lots of other dishes.

Now for the star dish of the entire evening, it goes to the Chicken Liver Mousse. When I first read the dish on the menu, I thought yuck! Now way. My boyfriend was convinced we had to just order and try it based on how odd it seemed. The bartender told us it was very good and we wouldn't be disappointed and boy were we not! We have talked about this chicken liver mousse whenever possible, especially when talking to friends about food and places to go and eat. It's delicious and we will definitely be back just for that dish alone.

We will definitely. Thank you to all the staff who were very friendly as the service was also very good

This place is known for its sourdough pancakes and yes they do live up to the hype. The pancake is thick with a slightly gooey center, which I'm a big fan of, but the best part is that it's completely soaked in maple syrup. And if you think that's not decadent enough, they also add two knobs of chilled butter at the top which slowly melts as you eat the pancake.

Service was friendly and attentive. Decor is rustic barnyard chic (so hot right now). They have a decent drinks selection at brunch, including a delicious aperol spritz.

This was my first time here.  Set on a small cobble stone street in the vinegar hill section of Brooklyn.  It's situated between Dumbo and the navy yard.  The closest subway is the York stop on the F train.   It has the appearance of a quaint storefront with a warm antique feel inside.  There's a small bar used for dining and a mixture of 2 and 4 seater tables.  They can combine for 6 easily.

The night I was there the menu had a good mix of appetizers from salads, octopus, chicken liver.  I had the chicken liver and octopus.  Both were tasty and octopus perfectly prepared.  Both were pricey  at about $18 each.  I enjoyed the chicken liver the most served with freshly charred bread and fris√©e and pickled red onions.  Plenty to share with the table of 4.

The main choices ran the gamut of pasta, chicken , pork and fish.  I ordered the pork chop served on cheesy grits.  It was sliced like a fine cut of steak and done medium rare.  The pork was tender juicy perfectly seasoned and rich.  It was well worth the $34 price.  Entrees ran between $24-$34.  There were two sides and we ordered the eggplant.  It was good and well prepared.

Service during the meal was attentive and professional.  I can whole heartedly recommend this place for a quiet romantic  dinner, family gathering or small celebration.  For 3 people with 2 beers and 4 wines 2 apps 1 side and 3 entrees the meal cost $240 not including tip.  I think it's reasonable to expect $100 per person for dinner.   It's a wonderful fine dining option in Brooklyn.

Delicious food!
I ordered the asparagus, beets and Brussels sprouts for the table and had the Pan roasted chicken as my main entree. Everything was perfectly seasoned and very flavorful. The chicken was tender and moist with a wonderful thin crispy skin. The caramelized onions and sprig of thyme were the perfect touch..Served right in the pan! I tried the homemade sodas and they were absolutely refreshing! For dessert I had a cup of coffee and the olive oil cake which was the perfect finish to a well rounded meal. Good service,Fresh food and a cozy ambience. Parking was very easy to find so it's def worth giving this place a try if you're in the Dumbo area of Brooklyn!

We stopped in on a Sunday morning for brunch and sat at the bar. Paul the bartender was cool as hell and was very attentive the entire time without being annoying. We ended up getting the omelet and the shrimp & grits with a side of bacon and a side of potatoes. The omelet was packed with big slices of squash and goat cheese which was the perfect combo of salty and sweet. The bacon was plentiful and perfectly cooked. The shrimp & grits were a delight to the taste buds and the potatoes were a nice surprise topped with creme fraiche and tomato peppers. Of course we had to have Bloody Mary's which were good n' spicy and we finished things off with a few mimosas. Paul kept topping us off and he gave us each another complimentary mimosa after we paid for our meal! Lastly, he made a great recommendation when we asked where was a cool place to drink some good beer. He told us about The Gutter; a fun, divey bar with great beer on tap, good music and you can also go bowling. This place was right up my alley (pun intended) and turned out to be my favorite part of the day. Thanks to Paul and to Vinegar Hill for the great food and good time. Cheers

Brunch review: A pioneer in a very remote & interesting  area next to Dumbo. The restaurant is charming and I've been here twice for brunch with different experiences. Their brunch menu is very very limited and first time was less than impressed. This trip was long overdue and enjoyed their food at 55 Water St especially the roast chicken.
Ate:
Shrimp and grits
""the pancake""
Greens
The shrimp and grits are tiny sized yet tasty. No bread or greens unless you pay $13 for some salad greens so value- eh. Now on to the PANCAKE - a superstar made from a sourdough starter and cooked in a cast iron skillet. It arrives bubbling with butter and syrup and baked with tart apples. I got the small size which is perfect for one or two.This is pancake pleasure at its finest and a top pancake, which redeems alot of misses.

Extremely salty food. Random incoherent flavors and also portions. A menu full of unhealthy and/or unethical options (chicken and pork, pulpo and foie gras). Careless, rude staff. The hostess showered our menus and table with drinking water--no one wipes it off, ever. The wait staff is too busy demonstrating inflexibility and angst.
Terrible salad, forced $6 bread and butter (toffee butter ?! Absolutely horrible). Main courses, which are 4 btw, take around 30/40 min to get out on the table--unappetizing, unmemorable. Ugly stemless wine glass, then a white wine glass used for bubbly. Extremely expensive for what is offered. Two stars for charming warm setting.

A hidden gem that chefs up a pretty solid brunch. No clue this place existed as I don't really frequent that block and didn't know there were any restaurants there. Yelp! to the rescue when I was looking for a brunch spot. This place is a bit eclectic ... it's a house with sitting on the main floor, basement and out back. Really chill vibe and thus draws a brunch crowd. I would definitely suggest give it a shot. The burger was legit and the service was friendly.

Usually a favorite brunch place but was disappointed when I went yesterday. Their sourdough pancake is ridiculously good. But when I asked for extra syrup the response was: ""it has syrup already."" ummm ok # 1 don't shame me if I like my pancake drenched in syrup #2 did you really just charge me an extra dollar for syrup?? I mean...Plus my wife got  the squash omelette but the squash wasn't peeled?! Hopefully they weren't on their game because it's thanksgiving weekend and the real pros were maybe away?

I used to love this local neighborhood spot. Unfortunately I don't know if they changed owners or management but the service and quality of good has not been on par. We had a dinner reservations for 7:00 pm and the staff asked us to wait at the bar, which was not a problem. But ended up waiting for 40 mins and while they took other guests that looked like walk ins ahead of us! We mentioned something to the staff when we saw this but just explained that they were waiting as well. Anyways we finally got seated we ordered and service wasn't an issue but the food from what I remembered used to be 10x better. Lacking flavor and just nothing worth going back for. I don't think we'll be back here again until something changes. It makes me sad to say this because it really used to be an amazing spot.

Made a reservation for dinner Monday night for a quiet meal in a new area. Restaurant is tucked away in what looks like a normal home, including a quaint outdoor area optimal for summer nights.

After spraying ourselves down with insect repellent (free of charge), ordered the Roasted Shishito Peppers ($12) and a couple glasses of red ($12 each) to start. Peppers are marinated and covered in a tangy spice; easy to eat and more than enough to get the appetite going for two people. Wine is strong, as we tried not to finish the glass while waiting for the food (about 25 minutes). For the main course, decided on the Cast Iron Chicken ($29) - a large half chicken marinating in a supremely lemony broth and a few heirloom potatoes. The chicken is tender, with crispy skin to give a nice balance. I found the lemon taste to be a tad overwhelming halfway into the meal, but didn't want to mess the dish up with hot sauce.

To finish off, had some Alpage Sbrinz cheese ($7) and a coffee ($3.50). Cheese is very similar to parmesan, a fine pairing with the jam and select crackers. La Colombe coffee is always amazing.

Considering the amount of food ingested, the price wasn't as bad I thought it would be. Service takes its time, but came often to check on us and the food was definitely well-prepared (not thrown in an oven). Would like to sit indoors next time if not too crowded.

Similar to some other reviews, I really wanted to like this place but there were some serious communication issues with the staff. Our party of 4 was forgotten.  We sat at the bar while we waited and the bartender was extremely rude and not accommodating at all. We tried to be patient and did enjoy our food when we finally got sat but I don't think it's worth it.

4 stars for great food: squid ink pasta, kale panzanella salad and the beet dish were all very delicious, fresh and light!

5 stars for superb atmosphere. The backyard is so lovely, shady, and enjoyable. Absolutely worth the trip to Vinegar Hill to score a table in this yard.

Magic. I had dinner with two friends here last night and we were over the moon by the time we taste the first few plates we ordered.
We decided to share lots of small plates because we weren't sure what to eat, and I think we won, because we were able to taste more than an usual dinner. Every single choice was incredibly tasty between the acid vinegar salad, the grilled smoky octopus, the delicate asparagus with ricotta, fresh prosciutto and sweet warm cornbread.
We all got glasses of different roses and they were all good as well. To end, we shared a slice of chocolate Guinness cake with a top layer of cream cheese frosting, which was surprisingly really light! Not sweet at all, just cacao. Amazing. Can't wait to come back!

I've been here twice for brunch, and both times were amazing. The place felt very homey, but a little small because depending on where you sit, you could be pretty close to your neighbor.  Both times we got the sourdough pancake and pork and grits. Sourdough pancake here could arguably be the best pancake I've ever had. Pulled pork in pork and grits was tender, juicy, and flavorful, and perfectly complimented by the grits and tomato sauce. Both times those dishes were sooo good that I don't think I'd want to try other dished from them.

One note tho, the first time we came, it was a male server and he was VERY slow on everything, I had to wave him down multiple times to get coffee and water refilled, and order our stuff. The second time we were seated on the other side of the restaurant and a lovely lady was our waitress, and she was on point, quick, and very nice. The inconsistency in service is the reason I trimmed on star off them. Maybe train the male server a bit more?

A one of a kind room, great setting for a meal. Have been many times since it's opening including recent dinner and brunch. While I love the light during the day, the brunch is frankly underwhelming.  Each dish we had needed something more on the plate. Dinner, however, is really great. Ate most of the menu with a group and loved it all. Simple yet delicious preparations with top ingredients. Excellent wine list as well.  Totally worth it if haven't been.

My husband and I hosted our Rehearsal Dinner here this past December. It was just breathtaking! The Carriage House has been renovated, and is an incredibly cozy, quaint, and unique space. We had nothing but incredible feedback from our guests, and our loved ones of all ages thoroughly enjoyed the evening.  The service was just phenomenal, as our team worked so hard to accommodate several requests. The night went without a hitch. We would, and often do, recommend this location for any private events as well as a meal! Great Job, Vinegar Hill House - we look forward to dining here again when we can. P.S. the Prime Rib and the Chocolate Guinness Cake ... some great stuff.

I went there on a recent rainy night and sat at the bar with my friend. The ambience is really special and the vibe is warm and cozy but the service and food were disappointingly sub par. The bartender who was waiting on us didn't smile once and seemed annoyed to even have to take our order. We ordered the liver pate (for $18) which was pretty good, although I've had better, and the portion was small with a few disproportionate pieces of toast. I didn't bother to ask our server for more. I ordered the lamb rigatoni ($26) which was tasty although a bit too salty and the portion again was very small. My friend ordered the hake which she said was simple and bland (at a mere $31). I won't be running back here. It was a lot of money for a very mediocre dinner.

Vinegar Hill House was named as having some of the best pancakes in NYC by Eater NYC, although only ranking 10 out of the top 15. Their sourdough starter is allegedly 60 years old. I'm on a bit of a quest to find the best pancakes in NYC and found these rather disappointing. The sourdough had a nice tang to offset the sweetness of the maple syrup and there was a very healthy dollop of butter on top for good measure, but presentation was decidedly lacking and the pancake was immediately made soggy by the syrup bath. It seemed like pretty average diner pancake fare.

Aside from the disappointing pancakes, the place had a nice vibe to it, reminiscent of something out of the historic part of Boston. It's got a certain rustic charm. There's no signage visible from the street so it's easy to miss, my taxi driver actually couldn't find it at first, and perhaps that's why I really hadn't needed to make that reservation. Either that or 11am on a Saturday is before the brunch rush, although that's certainly not been my experience at other places in my pancake quest.

I came here for dinner tonight with a couple of friends hoping to enjoy a ""farm-to-table"" type experience. Upon our arrival, we were asked to wait 10 minutes to be seated at a table that had already been open, set, AND reserved for us. Once we were finally seated, our waitress poured us a half-empty glass of water and proceeded to tell us which items on the menu were no longer available this evening, which just so happened to be all of the ones my friends and I were interested in trying. The waitress took off and didn't return for another 30 minutes to take our order from the remaining half of the menu. Of course, by the time she had arrived, yet another one of my selections was no longer available. I wonder why...

Alas, I was left to order the  ""cheeseboard,"" Field Greens Salad, and cornbread for the table to share, and the Market Fish as an entree. The food was brought to the table another 30 minutes later, exactly at the point when all of us were starving. The ""cheeseboard"" was nothing to write home about and the cornbread was halfway decent--a bit too bitter for my taste. However, three bites into the field greens salad was when I realized that the main ingredient (the ham) was nowhere to be found. I brought this to the waitress' attention who then called the manager over and apologized to us for the waitress' inability to communicate that they had yet again run out of another item on the menu. At this point, I was left to wonder--how does one have enough salad, but not enough ham? Hmmm?

Our entrees arrived 15-20 minutes after our appetizers. At last, we've made good time! I took a few bites of my fish which came with a calamari ragout and my mouth was parched from how salty it was. It tasted as though the fish was captured in the Dead Sea and then broiled in the tears of a chef who had just failed out of culinary school.

Finally, the bill came and the manager was courteous enough not to include the half-assed salad we had ordered as our starter. Overall, this may have been one of the worst dining experiences of the hundreds I've had in New York. I came for ""farm to table"" and instead, I got a bull in a china shop.

Over all 3.7 stars. Take F train to york ave stop. Cozy rustic spot to gather small group of friends for dinner. The menu is limited but all pretty good. Our group of 5 probably shared half the menu.

I can't say anything was sooo awesome that would entice me to order again but most items were done well and satisfying. The prices are higher than expected and the location feels remote and easy to miss.

The skillet corn bread topped with butter is large enough to share (I would not get this if I was sharing with just 1 person).

The roasted chicken was tender and the onions were good.

The pork loin was super tender and served medium well with large slices and side of beans.

The chicken liver mousse was pretty good with caramelized onions on toasted bread.

The manicotti was personally my least liked. Everyone else loved it. It wasn't bad at all but I'm just not a huge pasta fan.

The tomato salad was refreshing and light.

The octopus was good but forgettable...i think it had corn and chickpeas that lightened the dish.

We tired the Guinness chocolate cake with was rather very good. The other panacotta with smoked strawberry had actually more savory notes.

I didn't care for the cocktail menu so I opted for wine..i got a voigner but I didn't like it.

The staff was attentive and friendly. Certainly pleasantly  surprising experience given the location.

This funky historic house in the Vinegar Hill  eborgood offers old time charm, eclectic and interesting decor, and amazing food. Unique offerings arrive with perfect portion sizes and deliciousness! Got the pear pancake, the jalape√±o cheddar grits, and the goat cheese beet omelette. All were hot and perfectly cooked and Delicious! We split all three and were perfectly satisfied!
  The small sour dough pancake is about 6"" in diameter and delicious! Probably could have managed the large pancake, but that might have been a little too much! The coffee was good, the servers nice and knowledgeable, and the service great. It was a mellow Saturday morning, and while they were nearly filled to capacity, it didn't feel at all rushed.
    Good background music, clean silverware and linen napkins. Go there!

This place is perfect for date night. The food was exceptional -- everything we had was on point. We ordered: charred octopus, roasted beets, market fish (Bronzino), and the squid ink tajarin. They have an outdoor space as well so perfect

Quaint, Cute, Rustic in what I imagine is an up-and-coming-redevelopment-area.

We arrived about 15 minutes before the door opened so we decided to take a stroll around the neighborhood. It was quiet with a feel of ""please come and take me over and make be beautiful"" vibe to it.  I don't know... it's just a feeling.

Anyways... when we walked back to the restaurant right when they opened, there were 6 other people standing in line out front.  Darn... guess we should have just waited, we would have been the first ones in.  Ha!

We were seated immediately upon walking in, so no worries. The building was a home, so that when you walk in ... what I imagine was the parlor is now home to several 2-tops and 4-tops that can be arranged depending on your party size.  We opted for the garden seating out back since the weather was so nice. The tables and chairs are what you might find in... surprise, surprise... a garden.  The ground is a little uneven.. cuz you are in a back yard setting ... so the table and chairs may wobble a bit.  Use your core and stabilize your chair. It's not that hard.

Service was cordial, but a couple times we had to flag someone down to get more water.

The food was ok.... my BIL and I had the eggs benedict which were a little lackluster in presentation IMO.  No small slices of fruit or a couple little berries or greenery to jazz up the plate... just the eggs benedict.  I should have taken a picture but I was super hungry and just dug in as soon as it arrived.  The eggs and prosciutto were fantastic tho!  It was served on an English muffin so ... not anything out of the ordinary. Hubby had the shrimp and grits which I got a small bite of and it was super creamy.  The BIL's GF had a green salad and a side of bacon.   The salad was nothing special but the bacon was tasty since she shared a piece with me. Portions were average.  So, if you are starving and are thinking that Brunch here is going to be your only meal of the day... I'd say order a couple dishes.  On the flip side, they don't give you huge portions so that you overstuff yourselves to a glutinous mass. Which in reality, we really should be more mindful of our portion sizes.  Anyways...

This place is cute and a great place to come that is OUT of the hustle and bustle of the city, so if you are looking for a place that is quiet... this is the place.  If you are looking to get your BRUNCH ON with hearty portions and a lively atmosphere, you may want to try somewhere else.

Vinegar Hill house is in a pretty remote location unless you live in Dumbo. It's been on my list of places to try, but always fell off at decision making time for its small menu. What's crazy though is that in my recent travels on two separate occasions, someone has recommended that I go as soon as I mentioned I lived in Brooklyn- so back to the top of my list it went.
I arrived at 10:45 on a Sunday (they open at 10:30) so there were still plenty of 2 tops available and no wait. I beat the person I was meeting, so I sat that the bar for a drink, and read through the NYTimes style section that they had sitting out to flip through.
When we sat, the waiter suggested that the top ordered item was their pancake so we ordered that, eggs Benedict and a side of potatoes since the eggs came solo. The pancake was for sure delicious, smothered in a big scoop of butter with apples baked in. Eggs were yummy but nothing to rave about at their $17 price tag. We enjoyed our meal, but I wouldn't be running back unless I found myself in the area at brunch time.

Me and my closest friend have been craving wine for the longest, and what's the best thing to do after a long work week? is to find a new adventure. I took it upon myself to surfer the amazing world of Yelp and I stumbled upon this place. It's a vintage looking establishment, that provides a cozy feeling. The staff is very welcoming and answer your every question, I must say they have a good selection of wine. We had the Sauvignon Blanc, which satisfied my taste buds from beginning to the end. I'll be coming back.

Gowanus is probably my favorite section of Brooklyn for fabulous food. Black mountain wine house has a great neighborhood feel, you like you're in someones home. It doesn't feel stuffy, or pretentious. It's an extremely warm and welcoming resturant.

I started with the petite sirah for wine, and I wish I had stayed with that the whole night. It was smooth, bold, not too dry with good spice notes at the end.

The cured meat was probably my favorite small bite. Don't sleep on the housemade wholegrain mustard.  Everything was very well executed and had a great balance of flavors. I can't wait to come back and try more wine.

Overall: Would definitely come back to try more food. It's so home-y!

Ambiance: Cozy with a real fireplace and casual outdoor front area (enclosed). Feels very much like a lodge. Loved the random books inside. Limited seating though.

Service: Attentive without being bothersome. Staff seemed chill.

Food: Cheese was good, especially the t√™te de moine swiss. Charcuterie was average - nothing unique.

Drinks: Lots of solid wine options. Enjoyed the Cannonau red wine.

This is such an ideal date spot. Or in my case, it's such an ideal third-wheel spot. I've passed this place numerous times walking over from Gowanus to Park Slope. Its eye grabbing. Its a little log cabin house that looks like it belongs in the mountains or an abandoned forest and has been converted into a wine and cheese night cafe. They even have a cute porch with chairs out front. Wine was pretty affordable. For not being happy hour I could still get an over flowing chalice of Tempranillo for $8. Interesting food menu of cheese and charcuterie platters, mac and cheese with truffle oil, paninis, meatballs, crostini, and tarts. What you would expect at a wine bar. But the ambiance is really nice. I imagine this is great in the winter time and I think they even roar up a fireplace then.

Oh, they surprisingly also have a decent bottled beer menu. Any place that sells Samuel Smith oatmeal is doing something pretty right. I also played that game while I was half listening to my couple friends called 'How many of these people are on blind dates and how many of these people are in actual relationships' game. It's a good one. I'm pretty sure the table next to us with the two kids downing red wine, staring awkwardly at their menus and avoiding eye contact, separated as far apart as possible were blind date.

Rainy days in January and February were made for Black Mountain Wine House.

As the name suggests, it's as cozy as your grandma's house, and chances are you'll walk by thinking it's someone's living room and not actually a wine bar. They've created such a comforting environment, each seat should come with an eye mask and neck pillow for napping purposes.

It's small, but they pack a punch with a menu of comfort foods like mac 'n' cheese, charcuterie boards, and fondue (on Tuesday's only) and a rotating cast of wines of all colors and varietals. Nab a seat near the fireplace to up the ante on hygge vibes and enjoy one of the warmest wine bars this side of the Catskills.

What a gem!  Super cozy inside, great little seating/waiting area outside. The server was very welcoming and gave us great suggestions.  We ordered the pork belly special with pureed sweet potatoes, the tuna nicoise salad and the salt cod and Artichoke.  We loved everything we ordered.  The one slight disappointment was that the salt cod was supposed to come with potatoes and came with bread instead (without anyone mentioning it) - but it was still very delicious.

Most amazing cavernous, cozy wine bar in BK. Every time we're in from LA, we beeline it to this sweet spot. Curl up by yourself and dive into your novel or meet a friend for an intimate chat. It's the loveliest!

Been wanting to try this place since the winter! Wine and cheese is an excellent way to start the night. I had the Georgian wine (yes the state Georgia) and the petite sirah. The Georgia wine was a bit bitter but warmed up to me after a while. Petite Sirah came from the California region. It was a sweet wine and I tasted black currants. It reminded me of Ribena.

For food we ordered the Charcuterie (meat platter) and Fromage cheese. You got to order the cheese! It spread and tasted like butter. All the meats on the meat platter were great. Tasted wonderful with the cheese we ordered.

Come here for cheese and wine! They have an amazing selection of beer and wines. Cheers

What a lovely place. Nice service. Friendly staff.

Cool small outdoor area in front with wooden chairs and tables.

Ok..they have a working fireplace!! Books and bottles of wine on the wall along with farm implements. Farmhouse feel and smell (of the fire). This was a welcome hours stop on a cold afternoon.

Primitivo wine, Brooklyn brown beer, cheese plate and charcuterie plate.  Was perfect!!!

Craving a weekend upstate but your exorbitant NYC rent is holding you back? Come to Black Mountain Wine House. You'll totally feel like you're in a cabin somewhere with a fireplace, even if it's the middle of July.

A first date brought me to this spot after I mentioned my admiration for wine. He was on point with that, I have to say (thanks Michael, if you're reading this).

It's super cozy here with dim lights and warm decor. You're tucked into a really good neighborhood so that somehow makes you feel even more cozy and safe and chill. The chairs at the bar have backs on them thankfully so that when you start feeling that second glass buzz you can relax.

I had a Pinot Grigio from France which was great. The glasses will range from $9 to $20 and a bottle can be double that if you're in need of some major TLC.

The bartender was attentive and didn't bother us. I did not have any food but I'd like to come back and try their bites.

Stumbled upon the best winter date spot in the area!! I've never heard of this place before, but I passed it on a walk from Carroll Gardens to ParkSlope and at first glance thought it was just an out of place cabin.
The interior is cozy and on a Friday around 7 there was no lack of seating! My boyfriend and I ordered a bottle of wine and sat back and enjoyed the scene. It's definitely a unique spot and excited to go back- I've noticed a lot of reviews on the Fondue, so gotta try it!!

Geography is such a funny animal in NYC.  After slavishly following my phone's directions and turning off of bustling, 5 bar-per-block Smith Street onto bucolic, brownstone-laden Union St., I couldn't have made it more than half a block without thinking to myself ""This can't be right.""  You couldn't have felt more distinctly as if you were leaving a Brooklyn neighborhood's commercial district for an exclusively residential one.

But deep down, I knew better than to ever question the scary accuracy of Google Maps.  Sure enough, another half block later, I stumbled upon the cutest little oasis of a storefront.  It looks almost as if someone dropped a little Adirondack cabin on the corner of Union and Hoyt.  The outdoor area is gated enough to feel like a private garden - it's quiet and lovely, and hard to believe you are having a drink on an NYC street corner.

The food is great, and quite reasonably priced.  All plates are $12 and range from amusingly named/described sandwiches (e.g., the BLAT - BLT+ Avocado on 12 grain or Tuna Nicoise featuring ""Really expensive Canned Tuna"") to Salads or small, hot plates.  What they really specialize in, though, are the important things in life, by which I obviously mean beer, wine and cheese.

The Black Mountain Mac & Cheese is stellar, with the truffle oil being an incredible, luxurious touch.  The cheese plate option is wonderful as well - 3 for $15 for a great assortment of carefully curated options.  The beer and wine lists are both excellent, with a diverse array of styles/varieties.  You won't fail to find something to thrill your unique palate and/or pair with anything on their diverse menu. seem designed to provide a wide array of options to properly pair with their excellent food.

At any rate, I was enchanted - BMWH is charming and cozy without feeling cramped or in any way pretentious.  From the outdoor garden/country cabin vibe to the inside fireplace & French boite feel, I can't imagine a better place to steal away with a loved one for an intimate date, or to gather with friends for a small-to-moderate sized party.  I can't wait to come back many, many times... in particular on a Tuesday to experience their Classic Swiss Fondue night!

Cutest little cafe type wine bar in Caroll Gardens.  Slightly off Smith so it doesn't have all that busy crowd.   Has a tiny seating area outside, it would be nice to have a glass of wine by the fire at night.  Inside is cozy, great for a date.  Atmosphere lighting and all.  I also saw a small birthday dinner in there so they can accommodate a small group it looks like.

Cheese platter - they have a variety of cheeses to chose from for your platter.  I didn't know all the different types they had and the waiter was really helpful with descriptions and helping me decide.

I also had the Mac n cheese (without truffle sauce!!!).  I was amazed and delighted they could do That!  It was a creamy sauce, but could have used a little breading on top some type of texture and baked after.  I love mac n cheese, order it almost always order it when available so I get picky over little things.

Wine was good, only tried one glass though.  I need to do a flight tasting next time.

This little hall in the wall in Gowanus literally took me 10 minutes to find as I paced back and forth looking for the entrance.  Once I finally went inside I realized how intimate the restaurant ""seemed"" as it packed to the brim with people.  I ordered a Portuguese Scrumpy Cider which was quite unusual and delicious.  I kind of had to be on top of the staff to make sure I got a table for my date and I as there were more people coming through the front door.  Once we sat down the restaurant no longer felt crowded and was an incredibly intimate setting, trading conversation over an excellent Argentine Malbec, various cheeses, and a charcuterie board with imported meats.  I can't speak higher of this local date place although I wouldn't necessarily plan my who dinner there.

Pork belly on mashed sweet potato is done to perfection. The bartendress gave excellent wine and food suggestions and was so nice. Think sitting at the bar is likely roomier than sitting at a table.

I went to black mountain wine house last night for some drinks and dinner. It's really cozy and intimate. It's a nice date spot. They have a nice wine list, and a good amount of beers as well. They only serve beer and wine.

We shared a BLAT, which was a BLT with avocado. It was good, the bread was toasted. We also shared truffle macaroni and cheese. It was delicious! It had mushrooms. I love anything with truffle. The service was very good. The server checked in and made sure we were ok with drinks.
Overall, it was a cute place. I would definitely return!

Extremely cozy spot with great small dishes to share and a fantastic wine selection.

Came here on a Saturday night as a group of 5 for a chill night, looking for some good snacks and a cool spot to share a couple bottles of wine - and that's exactly what we got. We arrived around  9PM and the place was full but not many people waiting. Put our names down, and the staff were super friendly as we waited - they promptly put wine glasses in our hand and kept us updated. It's such a small space though that standing with a glass of wine in your hand next to the wood burning fireplace waiting for a table made us feel like we were already seated. Food was delicious and reasonably priced, though the portions could be a little larger, or we could have gotten some guidance on how many to order for 5 people. Will definitely return.

A sweet, intimate place with great wine and light food. A great date spot. My boyfriend and I love this place, especially in the early afternoon before the dinner crowds. I don't think I would come here with a bigger group because there's kind of limited seating, but what a nice quiet date place!

Everything about this place is amazing! Great food and wine and the ambiance is excellent.

I docked a star for the service - particularly for the asian man with the bun. He was outwardly short, abrupt, and rude to us. From the beginning, even if we asked him questions regarding the menu or drinks he was absolutely the opposite of what this place is supposed to be - a good, relaxing time.

Not sure why he works here with a bad attitude, it was the LOW of our night - dealing with his behavior.

I'm hesitant to write a review for fear of this place getting popular, but here we go...

Talk about a hidden gem! You would never know that this is a restaurant & bar just by looking at it from the outside. It is so adorable and cozy - they even have a working fireplace which blows my mind! With lovely wine and mixed drinks plus a very nice happy hour and a good choice of tasty food to eat, this place has it all.

My friend and I met here after work one day for happy hour and some snacks just to chat and hang out. She got a couple glasses of muddled wine which was delicious and I went cup for cup with white wine. We split an order of spicy meatballs and a BLAT (bacon lettuce avocado and tomato sandwich). Both of these dishes were super tasty and very filling.

Please don't tell anyone about this place...I'm hoping to keep it a secret as long as I can! It seems to be a local spot that only a few people know, so let's keep it that way.

This is one of my favorite spots in the neighborhood. The wine is great, but also so is the food! I recommend the mac n cheese, meatballs, the BLAT and....those are the only things I ever get because they're consistently good.

Wine-wise: the Nebbiolo is a great red and the Gr√ºner are my go-tos.

Ambience is super cozy, especially in the winter with the fire going. Highly recommend this spot!

Absolutely loved this little cozy restaurant and wine bar.  We went here for Valentine's Day (actually, the night before) and the decor is simply cozy, adorable, classy and romantic. The lights are dimmed and the fireplace is crackling.  The wine display on the wall is beautifully done.  It was a bit crowded when we arrived but we found a seat within 10 minutes.   We were seated right next to the fireplace and the mood was simply perfect. We ordered some absolutely delicious wine and some tasty fondue (a treat on Tuesdays), which was delicious, but I would suggest an array of different fruits rather than just bread (which got a bit bland).

The Mac n Cheese was simply divine, with the gruyere cheese and truffle oil that gives it such a special and upscale flavor.  I cannot stay away from anything ""truffle"" on a menu! I was hesitant to try it, but the Goat Cheese Tart might even be my favorite item.  Neither my husband and I are a fan of beets, but with the goat cheese, it came together perfectly.

Although all the wines are tasty, I cannot describe how delectable the mulled wine was.  The flavors were amazing and it was the best mulled wine either of us has ever had in our life.  No aftertaste, no bitterness, simply a perfect blend of spices.  I'm dreaming of this mulled wine for days afterwards! I highly recommend this place for a sweet, romantic date night with your loved one!

A really cool out of the way type bar. You go there and you feel super local. There are a few wooden seats outside in the front that when you sit there, you feel as if you're on a neighborhood stoop. This is a perfect date spot to impress any date!

One of our favorite neighborhood go to's, especially in the winter -- so cozy in there you feel as though you've escaped to some cabin in New Hampshire.

Great food (portions are pretty big even though they are technically 'tapas sized') and perfect for a casual night out. Good wine options as well though sometimes a little hit or miss, could just be our personal preferences.

I love this place! I've been here twice and both times were great experiences. It's so homey and cozy inside, and looks like an adorable country cabin from the outside. Definitely a chill, relaxed vibe!
The food, wine, and service were great. Awesome selection of various cheeses to try. The meatballs and mac and cheese were also super yummy! Such a great wine bar, I'd definitely recommend!

Second time here and love it so much I almost don't want to let so many others know how wonderful it is. But they deserve it, so -

A mountain cabin hidden in a quiet neighborhood close to the Carroll St stop. Extensive wine list with affordable house options, hot mulled wine, AMAZING rotating menu churned out of a tiny kitchen, and a roaring fireplace in the winter. Incredibly attentive and beyond able small staff to man a busy Saturday night. They kept us updated as we were waiting for a table and bought us a glass on the house for our patience.

TLDR: Get the mulled wine and mac and cheese.

The only downside of an evening at Black Mountain Wine House is the possibility that a woman will instantly and urgently ask to change her table after you sit down near her. I'm fairly sure I showered that month, but I suppose the issue could've been my voice, my face, my intimidatingly acute fashion sense and/or my general joie de vivre.

Whatever it was, I was left to ponder why I was so repulsive for the rest of my night/life.

Luckily I was at Black Mountain Wine House, and this cozy, snug spot is the only thing that can cheer you up when a stranger so blatantly and immediately despises everything about you. Everything about this place is perfection. And I mean everything; this includes:

The fireplace.
The excellent wine list.
The excellent beer selection.
The friendly, attentive service.
The delicious, well-executed menu of small plates, like...
The mac n' cheese, the seared chorizo special and the wedge salad.
The rustic, spare decor, especially when combined with the down-home musical choices.

How can anyone not love this place? Tucked off the main drags of the area, it's the ideal date spot, and the neighborhood joint that everyone wishes they had on the corner.

Take your lady here and you will have to actually fight to preserve your virtue afterward, because just knowing about such a fantastic little place will ignite an uncontrollable attraction within anyone with any semblance of good taste.

Cozy spot for a nightcap or late night snack with your sweetie. It's dark, warm and perfect - like a log cabin in the middle of Carroll Gardens. I loved it! There are enough tables for a small dinner group, but I would recommend this place for a date, double date max. It's a super intimate vibe.

Ordered mulled wine and Rioja. My first glass of red must have been from an old bottle, cuz it tasted old and flat, but the next few glasses were perfect.

Beer, liquor, cheese plates. Front yard with Adirondack chairs for the smokers. The short menu enticing enough for next time. Noted: Fondue Tuesdays.

My mister man took me here for a simple and cozy anniversary dinner. Loved it so much. The cheese is fantastic and the wine. My goodness. I had the resiling - soooo perfect. Not too sweet not dry. Nice and crisp.

We will be coming back! Oh try the fondue, Mac & Cheese, and the Roasted tomatoes. You'll love.

Small and cozy place with interesting cocktails!!
We literally ordered all their cocktails.. My favorite was Pacific Crest Trail which was jalape√±o infused tequila drink and Fiona apple which is a bourbon based drink.
Their Midnight oil drink was quite interesting.. it actually had Wasabi and Ginger!!! Can you believe that!!!
We also ordered their garlic fries which was yummy!! Its a small place so can get quite full..however we were 10 people on a Saturday evening and got ample seats to sit.

This place is nice. It's dimly lit. Very warm and inviting literally. You might break a sweat. They have a few tables and a long bar. They're happy hour is pretty damn good. I had the build-your-own charcuterie. That's not what it's called! I decided that's pretty much what it is. You choose whatever cheese and meat you want and it automatically comes with certain accompaniments. I was there relaxing and chatting with friends. There no rush. The staff is friendly and it got busy. When we left someone was ready to scoop up our table. The train station at Clark Street is nearby. And its also walking distance from Brooklyn Bridge Park and the Time Out Market.

Came with two other people on a weeknight and got a table right away. I had the There will be blood to drink, and shared the Shishito peppers, Grilled octopus, Duck confit tostadas and Parmesan garlic fries. The duck was cold (not sure if it was supposed to be) so that was a little off-putting, but everything else was delicious. I loved my drink (I'm a sucker for anything with blood orange) and out of the food, the fries were my favorite.

I stopped in for drinks on Halloween and had a great time. They had decorated the whole bar and it had a spooky vibe. I tried a few cocktails off their special menu and really enjoyed them. Nicole the bartender was super helpful in describing the drinks. One of them was a take on a Trinidad sour which I didn't know existed, but using some pumpkin related ingredient. It was one of the most interesting drinks I've ever had and absolutely delicious.

I also got the chance to try some of the food. I ordered a burger, medium rare, which came out perfectly cooked and delicious. I got about half way through until my girlfriend arrived and gobbled up the rest, remarking on how good it was. We also went with the meat and cheese plate which we liked. I would 100% recommend asking for extra bread because you're going to need it. It was pretty dark so I couldn't tell exactly what the cheese were but there was a salty probably Italian cheese, a milder cheese, and something what was definitely goat or sheep's milk based. The meats looked like some sopresta and maybe speck or prosciutto. Overall a solid meat and cheese plate for $21.

I'll definitely be back here in the future. From the other reviews it sounds like I need to make sure to hip up happy hour, $8 for a cocktail here is a bargain.

The drinks here are creative, sensational and delicious!  The food matches the quality of the food as well! However the mixologists here take care of their drinks whether happy hour specials or not - they take pride in their creations which absolutely shows and is appreciated!  I say get all the drinks and pad your stomach with a delicious burger!  I am not a fan of the restaurants along the street so if you can find a table - I'd do drinks and dinner here! They wont disappoint you! I promise!

Fun cocktail bar with pretty good happy hour deals.

$8 basic cocktails until 7:30 and $4 Gansett bottles (didn't even know that was a thing).

The Manhattan was great and strong. The Vodka Southside was simple but delicious. Our bartender Nicole was awesome.

They share a bathroom with Bevacco and there are only two, so if it's busy, it might be a bit of a wait.

Also the last Tuesday of the month is Tiki Tuesday!

This spot is PERFECT for date night. Low lighting, music is at a low volume, booths & bar seating. All around divine.

I had the Raspberry Road. It was perfection.
My companion found a really delicious mezcal-based drink.
They have a lot of beer and wine offerings.
All the drinks were tasty and they were served in fun glasses with pretty garnishes.

Employees were attentive without being overbearing and seemed like they were always up for a good conversation or an encouraging word in regards to the menu.

Drinks on the menu were $14. Allowing the bartender to make you a surprise drink (you choose the liquor and then let them go to town) runs $15. They may also have small plates?

This place is the jam. Good drinks, great service, AND it's steps away from the A/C train so you don't have to stumble home very far. Check it out!

Four stars on the food and five stars on the ambience and drinks here - the epitome of a sweet, intimate and cool spot to come for a date or hangout with a friend that you know will be filled with juicy relationship details and life ponderings.

Had a crispy Peroni at the marble bar and we split the sriracha wings, fries with garlic and Parmesan, and quinoa-asparagus bowl.

All were very good - not groundbreaking but great compliments to feeling tipsy. The wings were the standout and tasted like sesame chicken at a Chinese restaurant which was satisfying with my beer! I'm not dying to go back but I'd definitely come back for a last-min get together.

This is a fun and friendly spot to have a few drinks. The staff makes you feel right at home. They have a great variety of drinks on their happy hour menu especially the Vodka drink with mint, which I absolutely love.  Food is excellent, I enjoyed the fries with garlic oil, and they are one of the best I have ever tried.  The serving of the fries was massive. My belly was full after a couple of them. This is one of the best places I've been. Totally recommend it.

What a great place to end up on a rainy evening... With a smoky almond Mezcal cocktail. The ambience of this bar and adjacent restaurant is very classic prohibition. I can count on one hand the number of five star ratings I have given to places; but, for some odd reason, this place just flipped all the switches. Maybe it is the very cool 'candle scale' at the center of the bar. Maybe it's the very hip music vib that syncs with the Decor. Maybe it's the excitement of coming to Brooklyn for the first time. But whatever it is, kudos to all the previous yelp reviewers that beckoned me to this place!

We've lived around the corner from Binc for the past few years and decided to try their ""famous"" Binc Burger. Unfortuantely, we were both disappointed (we've had our fair share of NYC burgers).

The bar and atmosphere is awesome. Dark, cozy, romantic date spot. We sat at the bar and service was spot-on. Their artichoke appetizer was delicious (but very small portion).

Anywho, let's go back the Binc Burger. The burger was quite dry and under-seasoned, the bun was way too doughy for the thin beef patty, while the fancy cheese they used didn't seem to add anything to the experience. Could've used some acidity, if you don't mind be being a pretentious burger snob. I was just expecting more considering how patrons and the establishment seem to showcase the shit out of this burger.

On the first bite, one can immediately tell that the beef quality is nothing up to par with the likes of Brindle Room (East Village) or even two8two (Cobble Hill) or Long Island Bar (also on Atlantic) which are in the area. If you're looking to eat a delicious burger, head to those spots!

Also, all burgers at a place like this should include a side of fries. Don't charge extra. They were good though.

Come for the atmosphere and drinks. Nothing more.

Good night.

Came here on a Friday night and they had few drinks on their happy hour menu ($8 drinks) so I got a Manhattan, which was made well.

For food, we got the sirarcha hot wings, they were really good and not spicy like they sound. Overall, they were flavored well.

We also got the mac and cheese, which was good but nothing extra ordinary.

The place is small and cozy, I loved it!

Our server was friendly and quick.

Definitely recommend this place for some drinks and tapas/small plates.

There is one great bartender left. As as a tourist to Brooklyn when a group of thugs who think they are tough because they have strength in numbers are regulars you have to question why go to such a place.

Very disappointed that the local ""workers"" in the area are wannabe gangsters who have something to prove. Grow up children and this includes the owners. Know your clientele.

I come here for the sweet happy hour. Vodka drink with mint doesn't sound fancy or special, but it finds a way to be exactly that. All other drinks on happy hour awesome as well. Also have had the power boy which was fantastic, but if you need a ""light"" snack for the group, the fries are massive and close to best fries I've had at s restaurant. Well worth it. HH till 7:30! Score!

I was staying in Brooklyn for one night and was grabbing drinks with a friend, so she suggested checking out The Binc before eating dinner. I was asking the bartender what they recommended on the menu and they actually made a custom made cocktail based off my likes/dislikes. It turned out great and even my friend's Hatchet Jack was made perfectly. I then ordered the Isla Calavera and was surprised how smooth it went down for a tequila drink. We also shared a Hatchet Jack that had a complex taste, but worked really well in the end.

The way the bar is setup is great to have a conversation with another person, so we ended up staying longer and that started to cut into my dinner. I ordered the pastrami tacos and cheese plate, but was completely let down by both. The pastrami tacos had a strange aftertaste while the cheeses included on the plate were a bit harder than we would have liked. I would have given this place 4 stars if it wasn't for the food, but I'd come back for the cocktails if I'm in the area.

Hit up the binc on a Wednesday night to find ourselves in an incident location with great ambience. They have a wide variety of drinks selections including some great craft beer. Bartender/mixologist knows his stuff and is quite friendly. Had the binc burger and the wings both were excellent definitely a great spot if you're in the neighborhood.

A swanky old world cocktail bar with retro black and white hexagon floor tile, intimate, dim lighting located in Brooklyn Heights that offers Happy Hour and small plates.  After attending a poetry reading nearby hunger pangs strike hard as I was enticed for a cocktail and some small plates.  Upon arrival the business appears small similar to a caf√© size.  I was the sole customer after thirty minutes upon opening the business on a Saturday evening, ergo I was serviced immediately.  My server George was prompt, polite, attentive and made suggestions for cocktail.  Manhattan cocktail is listed in their menu which is an essential basic since the drink originated in New York City in the early 1870s.  Happy Hour is available everyday for cocktails only.  The bill is submitted to the customer embedded in a wine cork with the business's postcard- innovative and a fresh outlook rather than the standard traditional black leather guest book.

Mexican Mule $8.00- tequila and sliced jalape√±o and ginger beer crushed ice with fresh lime served in a highball.  Drink was ok, nothing to boast for greatness as it was too much crushed ice than the drink main ingredients and I am not a fan of jalape√±o.  I did tasted the ginger beer.

Truffle Fries $9.00 -roasted garlic aioli with mayo and ketchup but disappointedly no sea salt.  The portion was abundant which can be shared.  The fries appears very burnt.  In the NYC French fry scene, the golden rods from Pommes Frites are covered in sea salt and served in a white paper cone while competitors use parsley and chives but, disappointedly, The Binc uses neither.

Pastrami Tacos $14.00 - three short rib pastrami tacos covered in mustard seed a√Øoli, cornichons, and cilantro with fresh lime.  The meat was extremely dry and somewhat stale or not fresh.  I prefer pulled pork rather short rib.  The cornichons (pickled cucumber) were microscopic small and mustard seed a√Øoli green spread or sauce was very minimal as I was unable to swallow for the blandness.  I like the soft shell of the taco.

Note:  The Binc opens late either 5 pm or 6 pm because they close at 2 am in the morning.  Visa and MasterCard accepted only for credit/debit cards.

This is a cozy spot (love the lighting) with a generous happy hour- $8 cocktails every day til 7:30. They also serve my favorite beer right now the Forever Ever IPA. But what pushed this review to a 5 were the fries with garlic aioli. They were so delicious- and I've had many a fry in my day! Service was top notch. My only recommendation would be to make the bathrooms gender neutral so there are two options for everyone instead of one.

I recently went on a cocktail date here. We sat at the bar and ordered a few drinks. Their happy hour ends at 7:30, so we caught the tail end of that. My first drink was a well-made Manhattan. My second was something the bartender made for me after I told him what I liked.  It had scotch and orange something from what I could taste. Either way, it was smoky and I liked his confidence.  My date enjoyed his drinks as well.

Drinks, bartender, bar back, atmosphere, all of that would garner 5 stars, but minus 1 star for the sad cheese plate.

From a cocktail bar, I expected a little more effort.  The cheese plate included 3 pieces of oiled toast, three piles of distinct cheeses, and a handful of toasted walnuts. What it was missing was a jam, a jelly, a mustard, a condiment of sorts to bring the cheese and bread together.  Maybe I especially feel this way because all the cheeses were hard cheeses, not one soft, so it all felt kinda dry.

Either way, I would go back if in the neighborhood, or for a cocktail date.

This cocktail bar has a list of cocktails that will interest any fan of mixed drinks. The menu is short but well presented. This is not a large place but with a 1920's feel is most refreshing.

Great spot for cocktails and food!
I loved the vibe and decor. It was cool being able to go up to the bar and have a waitress so there was never a shortage of drinks.
Everything tasted great and got me sufficiently buzzed for not so much money .

These restrooms were amazing !!! It was a pleasure to relieve some bladder stress in there .

As relatively new Brooklyn residents, we're still exploring all the restaurant options in and around where we live. We've been working our way down Henry Street and finally got to visit The Binc for happy hour and a light dinner.

First of all, the atmosphere. Very cozy and intimate. It's a relaxing place to enjoy their awesome cocktails. Try the Corpse Reviver #2. Delicious.

#2: The staff. Very friendly and helpful and the speed of service was fabulous. This feels like a neighborhood bar where you are treated as a regular even if you've never been there before.

Finally, the food. Every single thing we ordered was really, really good. Not just ""okay"" but amazing! Simple dishes like roasted baby beets, truffle fries, and short rib pastrami tacos were prepared and plated perfectly.

So, to summarize: I think we've found a favorite new neighborhood spot. We'll be back again soon!

I met an acquaintance for a drink here. We both ordered beers from the happy hour menu and shared a plate of truffle fries. I'm surprised to hear complaints about the fries because mine were perfect and delicious. The ambiance is perfect for a date and is quite charming. The bartenders were friendly and attentive. They asked a few times if we wanted more drinks without being pushy. They consistently refilled our water glasses without any prompting. Overall, my first experience here was pretty good. I'm looking forward to coming back and trying a different drink and bite to eat.

A really neat little tucked away spot for anyone looking for some tasty cocktails and great ambiance. Close to the subway station, and just a short walk from Brooklyn bridge park,  the binc is a perfect place for a couple of drinks before heading home.

Service is impeccable. When my group and I arrived we weren't sure there would be a spot for us to sit as it was a bit crowded, but they made it happen for us, which I truly appreciate.

As for drinks, take a risk and have one of the bartenders make a special concoction just for you based off of what you like... you won't regret it! These bartenders have such a knack for creativity in mixing drinks, and their attention to detail is impressive. I applaud them immensely. Plus, it's fascinating to see them create a drink for you on the spot. Wish I got the name of our bartender**edit: Richard!** as he deserves to be recognized for such a great experience at the Binc. Loved my arboreal drink, hey! Thanks again for a wonderful night!!

It's not a speakeasy - it's a bar - but the drinks they make are very, very good.  We had recently tried Le Boudoir, which was a little disappointing, so we were happy to have good drinks with more substance and balance.  And the fact they have happy hour drink list till 730 on Saturday was a pleasant surprise.

We ordered from their happy-hour drink menu ($8), and my favorite was their version of Manhattan.  And for our 2nd round, we ordered from their regular drink menu and they were all very good.

Since it's a bar, it can get too loud to have conversations since there's background music and all other noises bounce around off the hard surfaces.
And their fries are no good.  Very soft and soggy.  But the drinks?  Yay!

Visited The Binc as a party of three and shared the salmon poke, mac and cheese, artichoke hearts, baby beets, and calamari.
The five small plates were large enough to satisfy our appetite and each plate was tasty. We particularly enjoyed the artichoke hearts and the mac and cheese, especially since they removed/put the pork on the side, and we liked the happy hour cocktails, $8 each.
Definitely worth a visit if you're near Brooklyn heights/dumbo/Clinton hill/vinegar hill.

This place honestly was nothing special when it comes to the food. Had the burger and something that tasted like gnocchi and both were pretty bland tasting. Not bad but nothing to come back too. Beer was good and they had great cocktails so I'd say I would rate it a 3 for food and a 4-4.5 for drinks.

Ambiance is low-lit, low-key, swanky cocktail bar. Tables along one wall, and a wraparound marble bar. Service was quick and succinct at 8pm on a Monday, one bartender tending the whole place. I ordered a cocktail from the menu and the burger.

If you remember one thing from this review... the burger is effing AMAZING. $12. Get it before they raise the price. Medium rare. So good.

The first cocktail (High Country, some sort of hot apple cider with funky lavender flavors) was good and sightly on the boozy side. I opted for a daiquiri (not on the menu) as my second, to which the bartender happily obliged. Very balanced and just downright delicious. I'd recommend ordering a classic daiquiri if you come here on Mondays and Thursdays.

Bottom line: Impressive, sexy ambiance; good food; tasty cocktails. Need I say more?

It's the best Thai food we've had in the States. Hands down. Spicy AF but oh so good.

We've been trying to support small businesses especially our Brooklyn restaurants during this COVID-19. Thankfully AMEX is doing a small business promotion where you get $5 off a minimum purchase of $10.

The overall headline-- this food was AMAZING. This, my friends is the REAL DEAL. As soon as we got to the car with the food, you could smell the aromas of spices from the bags. It was absolutely heavenly. Honestly, I think it is the BEST MEAL we have had all year. Definitely the best since COVID-19 hit.

We ordered:

Kanom Jean Kiew Warn Gai- Rice Vermicelli & Spicy Chicken Green Curry- $18 Spicy, so spicy but oh so delicious. Such a yummy mix of chicken and veggies. The liquid gold was out of this world. Initially I was let down by the portion size but to be honest, it was the perfect amount in the end. I would have preferred rice instead of noodles but it was so so so so so good. (Is that too many so's?)

Khao Soi Nuer- Northern Egg Noodle Curry Soup with Beef Shank- $18
Also spicy-- these dishes are NOT for the faint of heart. We liked that they didn't water this down at all. Every bit full of flavors and heat. But so delicious. It came with various toppings to add in including the porkskin. It was a really nice touch.

Tue Ka Ko- Fried Little Coconut Milk Cakes with Black Bean & Taro- $9 Sweet but not too sweet. Little muffins of tasty goodness. The sweet sauce that came with it -- divine.

Bonus Drinks- They gave us to Thai Iced Teas for free-- which was nice and as we chomped down on the meal--well appreciated given the heat! They were a little too sweet for our liking but that was easily remedied in a few minutes after the ice melted.

So, we plan to go there again (and again) to try other things on the menu. We ordered 30 minutes before closing so they had sold out of everything on the specials menu-- maybe we will call earlier to get something from there next time.

Our hats off to the Chef!

Had a little date night with my boo tonight.  We've been trying to support small businesses especially our Brooklyn restaurants during this COVID-19.  Thankfully AMEX is doing a small business promotion where you get $5 off a minimum purchase of $10.

The overall headline-- this food was AMAZING.  This, my friends is the REAL DEAL.  As soon as we got to the car with the food, you could smell the aromas of spices from the bags.  It was absolutely heavenly. Honestly, I think it is the BEST MEAL we have had all year.  Definitely the best since COVID-19 hit.

We ordered:

Kanom Jean Kiew Warn Gai- Rice Vermicelli & Spicy Chicken Green Curry- $18  Spicy, so spicy but oh so delicious.  Such a yummy mix of chicken and veggies.  The liquid gold was out of this world.  Initially I was let down by the portion size but to be honest, it was the perfect amount in the end.  I would have preferred rice instead of noodles but it was so so so so so good.  (Is that too many so's?)

Khao Soi Nuer- Northern Egg Noodle Curry Soup with Beef Shank- $18
Also spicy-- these dishes are NOT for the faint of heart.  We liked that they didn't water this down at all.  Every bit full of flavors and heat.  But so delicious.  It came with various toppings to add in including the porkskin.  It was a really nice touch.

Tue Ka Ko- Fried Little Coconut Milk Cakes with Black Bean & Taro- $9 Sweet but not too sweet.  Little muffins of tasty goodness.  The sweet sauce that came with it -- divine.

Bonus Drinks- They gave us to Thai Iced Teas for free-- which was nice and as we chomped down on the meal--well appreciated given the heat!  They were a little too sweet for our liking but that was easily remedied in a few minutes after the ice melted.

So, we plan to go there again (and again) to try other things on the menu.  We ordered 30 minutes before closing so they had sold out of everything on the specials menu-- maybe we will call earlier to get something from there next time.

Our hats off to the Chef!  Two new fans over here!  We strongly recommend Ugly Baby.  Support local and check them out.

Best Thai food in NYC, bar none. And probably the best restaurant in Carroll Gardens. If you haven't been--why? You are seriously missing out. This is the closest you'll get to a trip to Thailand right now, and the people that work here are the BEST!

Yes, many of the dishes are spicy! Very spicy! But not all: try the tumeric fried sea bream or the little coconut cakes if you don't want spicy at all; go for the khao tod nam klook (sooo good) if you want a little heat. And get some Thai iced tea to soothe your tongue! They also have to-go cocktails and wine.

It's carry-out only rn due to covid, but SUPER fast (15 min wait on a Friday night), everyone wearing masks, safe, clean, easy system to pay. Love this place so much.

Aug 20th 2020 - Better than ever, and here's why...

To say that we've been huge fans of this restaurant since the day they opened would be an understatement of epic proportion.  We love everything about Ugly Baby!  The food, the staff, the creativity and uniqueness, to the heat and their fun sense of style.  It's all authentic and truly one of a kind.

Now Yelp has been pretty inactive since Covid-19, but I am compelled after having yet another epic and delicious meal delivered to Brooklyn Heights that I want to make sure y'all know that UB is open and still making incredible food... and BEST OF ALL... are the weekly specials!

Every week it's something new, and it's ALWAYS worth trying a plate or two from the specials menu!  So while currently they are only doing take out and delivery, please know you have to take advantage of the weekly specials!  We have been ordering weekly and we are consistently delighted in an over-the-moon kind of way about how exciting and delicious these dishes are! The specials change every week, and that keeps it *very* interesting, and it brings us back for the following week.

A neighbor of ours didn't realize Ugly Baby delivered up to Brooklyn Heights (check deliver range map below), so please check their delivery range map!  They post weekly specials on Instagram under the name uglybabynyc.  Check it every Thursday!

To those wanting for a place to start, we suggest going with the Fried Turmeric Sea Bream as a must have.  We order it every week, it's flavorful and addictive beyond belief and not spicy hot.

That's all for now; now go get some Ugly Baby!  :-D

June 4th 2020 - first experience with delivery service after COVID-19, and...

Our taste buds are resurrected, rejuvenated, and rejoicing thanks to their delivery service to Brooklyn Heights!  Hallelujah!!!

What a meal!!!  Frankly I wasn't even terribly hungry before eating and once I started on the Duck Salad I realized how much I really missed Ugly Baby.

In addition to the Duck Salad, we ordered the Sea Bream, Shrimp Squid & Salted Egg Yolk, and the daily special of grilled hanger steak & sticky rice.  Seriously 10/10.

We also had a bottle of the Farnum Hills cider, which is always a perfect pairing to anything on the menu.

Thank you so much, we love you guys and your food!  We'll be back next week.

We just came back from Ugly Baby tonight and again - no matter how many times we go - they just never cease to amaze and delight us with their wonderfully delicious dishes!

It just so happened that tonight was their one year anniversary of being opened, and although we go way back with many of them to the original Kao Soy days from years ago (see below for the whole story) it is just stunning that they still continue to impress and even surprise us with their wonderful cooking.

I would also be remiss to not mention a word about the staff.  Not only are they all very attentive, but they are warm and genuine people.... and FUN!  You can see everybody is really happy to be there, and qualities like that count.  It's just good Mojo!

We always leave with a smile on our face and a satisfied appetite. And then we immediately talk about how wonderful each dish was!

So we had dinner for two.  Here's what we had:

1) Laab Ped Udon aka spicy duck salad.  A great way to start a meal!  The heat is here, and we want it!  Such a wonderful array of tastes all in one lovely dish.

2) Pla Tod Kamin aka fried turmeric sea bream.  Always one of our favorites, we pretty much always need (not want - need!) this.  It's a whole fish with seasoning and flavors to die for.

3) Nuer Ping aka beef skewers.  This was new for us - and WOW really so tender and tasty, so flavorful - ok we just finished dinner and I am not hungry - but I am truly salivating just thinking about it right now.  No exaggeration.  I think I always need this.

ALSO - Congratulations to the entire staff for making the September 2018 bon appetit Top 10 list of America's best new restaurants!!!  #3!!!!!  That's a nationwide list.  This is the only restaurant in NYC on the list.  It's a lovely piece on the restaurant, well worth the read.

To Chef Sirichai, thank you.  To us, you are not just a chef.  You're a great artist that just so happens to use food as a medium.  Your food and your entire staff always makes us happy!

To the staff, thank you.  Without your hospitality and wonderful spirit the food would not taste quite as good.

Thank you all!!!  Ugly Baby will always be our favorite restaurant!

WOW!!!

OK, so we were huge fans of the original version of Kao Soy and Chiang Mai in Red Hook.  When Chiang Mai closed, we were really bummed out, but we were told they were going to open another restaurant in the future so that alleviated some of our sorrow!

In subsequent months we tried other Thai restaurants, nothing was nearly as good as the food we had grown so accustomed to and loved so very much.  We *really* missed Chiang Mai...

Month after month we would check Chiang Mai's Facebook page desperately trying to find an update on the status of the new restaurant, but there was little information.  And then.... after a year or was it two years?... FINALLY!!!  Our wait was over!!!

Ugly Baby!  What a great name!  We went to the website and learned that the dishes are based on cuisine from all different regions in Thailand.  The prior restaurants were focused on Northern Thai food, so this would be something new and exciting!

Literally the next day we went to Ugly Baby, and we were so happy to see all of the familiar faces we missed so much!

We looked at the menu and didn't know where to start.  We went with several suggested dishes, knowing we would be in good hands...  and then..  our first dish was presented...

Kao Tod Nam Klook - curried rice, pork skin, peanut & ginger.  And with the very first bite, oh... my... god!  The wait was over!  Such flavor... oh my... so yes, we both decided we could eat this dish every single day and never get tired of it!

Gai Golae - southern style chicken thigh skewers.  Amazing!  Chicken so tender it almost melted off the skewers... wonderfully flavored...  really superb.

Khoong Muk Kai Kem - shrimp, squid & salted egg yolk.  Simply delicious.  Need to have this again.

Kang Hoh - northern dry Hung Le & red curry paste with pork shoulder, spare ribs & mungbeen noodles.  Fantastic!!  Really special.

So that was dinner for two, and we absolutely loved every dish equally.

All of these dishes present a symphony of different flavors that seem to have a beginning, a middle, and an end!  It's not just one note of flavor that stays consistent throughout the plate.  It's a symphony for the tongue!!  It sounds crazy but it's true!

We didn't think it was possible, but Ugly Baby is even better than the former restaurants.  We can't wait to go back and try the rest of the food on the menu.

Thank you Chef Sirichai!

TL;DR - If you want the best Thai Food in NYC go to Ugly Baby.  Period.

Spice junkies near and far - I have found your temple. Ugly Baby is not just any Thai restaurant. If you think you have already eaten the spiciest Isan Thai food you could find, think again. I know this because I asked how spicy the spiciest dish (Kua Kling) here was and the server just laughed to himself. However, fortune favors the bold so we dove headfirst into the fiery dishes to come.

You can probably start things slow with the Tue Ka Ko, which are fried little coconut milk cakes with black bean and taro. This is a great appetizer to prepare your palate for the volcanic flavors to come. Next up on my first visit here was the Laab Ped Udon spicy duck salad. If you want to consume your dishes in escalating heat order, then this dish should be eaten last. This unassuming salad will set your taste buds ablaze, but oh it just hurt so good. Same with the Kua Kling Southern dry eye round curry. This and the duck salad could go toe to toe in a heavyweight spiciest dish boxing contest.

If you can still read the menu through the tears in your eyes, other great options on the menu encompass noodle dishes, rice dishes, and fish. The Khao Soi Nuer Northern egg noodle curry soup with beef shank is probably the way to go in the noodle department, wonderfully creamy and savory but also devilishly hot. The Pla Tod kamin fried sea bream also helped somewhat in cooling our mouths as did the Kao Tod Nam Klook curried rice.

Sensitive stomachs be warned - Ugly Baby may not be the place for you. For the rest of us, every dish is expertly prepared and bursting at the seams with flavors - spice included. If you cannot get enough of spicy food, Ugly Baby will truly put that to the test. If you can make it out alive, you will want to keep coming back again and again.

Review for visit before COVID-19. This place is open for pick up (and maybe delivery) so please support!!

Guys let me tell you, brunch is THE time to go! We came here at 1:30pm on a Sunday. It was my first time but the couple I'm with have lived in Carroll Gardens for 5 years and said that they've never been able to just walk in and get a table. Note that the restaurant closes between 3-5pm.

Not completely sure but it seems like a family business. The person who took our order is super knowledgeable and I love that she gave us suggestions based on our questions and recommended complimentary dishes based on our order. I love people who have an opinion about the food they serve.

In terms of food, here's what we had:
Tue Ka Ko -- Fried little coconut milk cakes with black bean & taro. Really good, I highly recommend. Little bites of heaven (almost like a muffin bite but better). Not overly sweet and the black bean adds an interesting component. It's supposed to be an appetizer but I basically saved one for after the meal to help combat the spiciness and almost serve as dessert :)

Kao Tod Nam Klook - Curried rice, pork skin, peanut & ginger. SUPER delicious, definitely very flavorful and different from what you'd probably expect. There was less rice than I'd expected, a lot of flavor and spice. I think this was probably the spiciest dish out of them all. There was literally basil leaves still on the stems, super fresh. I personally enjoyed adding it to each bite but I like that you have the option yourself. Almost like DIY!

Kang Hoh - Northern Hung Le, red curry paste, pork shoulder & glass noodles. I think this is the name / description what we got? Although what we got came with pork skin and also sticky rice. The pork shoulder was good, but nothing super amazing. There was also bamboo shoots from what I remember. The different components came separately instead of mixed together like I expected.

Khao Soi Nuer - Northern egg noodle curry soup with beef shank. This is probably THE dish everyone gets when they come here. My couple friend broke the crunchy pieces to soak in the curry. Looking back, I actually would've preferred it not broken and pushed in because it all just became soggy. I missed having that crunch with the noodles. Don't stir in the spicy stuff on the side if you can't handle super spicy! Overall, I was disappointed by this dish. I liked the Pig and Khao once (before they got a new chef in 2018) and really wanted this one to be better.

In summary, definitely worth a trip! But not sure if it would be worth anything over a 30min wait.

We got the memo that they serve REALLY SPICY Thai food probably around the third time they informed us of that, as we pored over the menu. They were not wrong; there was a good amount of heat in some of the dishes, and they don't entertain any requests to tone it down.

My favorite dishes were the shrimp/squid in salted egg yolk, and the green curry. We ended up pairing the salted egg yolk sauce with any garnish that was available by the end of the meal - because it was AMAZING. Overall, I thought it was a solid 4.5 stars experience - great authentic Thai food, fresh modern decor and cutlery, topped with personable and honest service. Can't wait to be back.

1. Kanom Jean Kiew Warn Gai (rice vermicelli & spicy chicken green curry)
2. Sai Tod (fried pork intestine & Jaew)
3. Laab Ped Udon (spicy Udon Thani's spicy duck salad)
4. Khoong Muk Kai Kem (shrimp, squid & salted egg yolk)
5. Moo Hong (phuket stewed pork belly)
6. Kang Prik (spare ribs & bird's eye chili curry)
7. Durian sticky rice porridge

Before coming to Ugly Baby, I read all the reviews (and warnings). I even planned a short trip to Ample Hills for dessert and wore a shirt underneath my sweater in case the sweats came on too strong. I'm happy to report that I made it through intact. If you are not a huge spice freak like me, it's imperative to order a good balance of dishes and highly recommended to share (the party next to us ordered individual entrees and I could see sweat dripping down their face throughout our dinner service).

We ordered (in order of increasing spice levels): the Kao tod nam klook ($17), Sai tod ($12), Khoong muk Kai kem ($20), and Khao soi nuer ($18). It's hard to pick a favorite because they're all singularly delicious but complement each other well.

The sai tod, crispy fried pig intestines, could be lightly spicy if you choose to eat it with the jaew, a smoky dipping sauce made of dried chilis, cilantro, and lime. It's a great appetizer to get you started for the rest of the meal.

The kao tod nam klook is a savory and tart rice dish that features crispy pork skin, crunchy peanuts, fermented isaan sausages, and loads of ginger. As one of the few non-spicy options, it comes with raw cucumbers, string beans, and lettuce which are very useful when quenching burning tongues. Overall, it provided a refreshing respite to the spicier, heavier curries like the khao soi nuer. This intensely aromatic curry noodle soup was well-balanced, with the heat slowly creeping up on you as you continue slurping the wide egg noodles and beef shank bites. The pickled mustard greens and the sweet fried bits sprinkled atop the khao soi helped to counter the heat but this is where munching on a cucumber from the kao tod nam klook would come in handy.

The Khoong muk Kai kem, an intensely savory but equally sweet stir-fried shrimp, squid, and salted egg yolk dish, comes with a side of rice. As the dish is lightly spicy, the rice is great paired with the seafood or as a palate cleanser in case you run out of raw veggies to cool your tongues with from the khao soi. To be fair though, the staff is pretty attentive about refilling your water (as well as providing recommendations if you're unsure what to order).

Overall, the spice was not as punishing as I expected it to be. Instead, it was nuanced and balanced well with the other main flavors in Thai cuisine; salty, sweet, and sour. This was some seriously sublime Thai and I look forward to returning and trying out the rest of the menu soon.

According to my foodie Thai friend from Bangkok, this is likely the best Thai restaurant in the city. She knows her food (not just Thai) and I trust her judgement.

Lucky for me I moved into the neighborhood and have been able to dine here on a few occasions and even get takeout during this Covid pandemic.

Spicy food is SPICY, they will warn you as best they can so don't take their warning and suggestions lightly. If you love spicy like I do you won't be disappointed and the flavors STILL come through. Delicious offerings with carefully crafted classics and delicate touches... a true adventure for the palate. Not everything on the menu will set your mouth ablaze, there is variety but if you don't like spicy, you will be a little limited. Southern Thai food is known for the Thai chilis that bring these dishes their heat.

Among my favorites are the Squid with Egg Yolk (exact name escapes me), Sour Pork, Khao Soi, and if you dare Laab Ped Udon (spiciest thing I ever ate). Their dishes vary in flavor and yes despite some of their spice, they are still full of flavor. Their menu changes and they do not take reservations so put your name down and grab a drink somewhere.

A feast for the senses and a far cry from most ""Thai"" food Americans are used to.

Delivery was just as delicious as on site dining.  Food was sheer perfection of earthy heat, spice, tang, crunch and cool snap. From the weekly special menu, we ordered the Yum Mamuang which featured fresh Betal leaves which you wrapped around sour mango, ground pork, peanut and coconut.  We loved it and hope they will feature it again.  From the regular menu we ordered three favorites; Kang Hoh, Laab Ped Udon and Khao Soi Neur. The Laab is the spiciest and you smile as you cry a bit eating it!

Phone service was quick, friendly and helpful, ready to explain any dish and make suggestions ordering.  We placed our order at 4, they start cooking at 5, and our order was delivered at 5:30.

Check out their delivery area map.  We were super happy to see Brooklyn Heights included.  Weekly specials, of which there are several each week are posted on Wed on their Instagram account.  But don't be tardy, the specials run out!

Next time we will order Thai beer or wine to go with the meal to put the bow on a perfect dinner.

Another 5 Star meal with bold, complex, spicy flavors.  No dish is ever quite like another!
The menu had some new updates since I last dined here and tonight we had:

Kang Hoh - since these tender chunks of pork shoulder were my favorite dish last time, we ordered it again, and again hands down no quibble delicious!

Stingray in curry - sweet, juicy stingray in a very spicy curry that did not overwhelm the perfectly cooked fresh fish.

Beef tendons - a base of tendons, noodles in sauce, bean sprouts and peanuts, cicharronds, fried wide noodles and cilantro!  It is a brilliant combination!

Truly amazing, tastebud dazzling dishes with super friendly efficient service.  I had take out the first time and walked 1.2 miles in the cold home because but I was determined to give them a try and not eat somewhere else.  Four days later I was back at 5:00 sharp to ensure I got a table and not wait in the cold or do take out again!

Laab Ped Udon - the spicest and hands down favorite!  It's a good burn!
Kang Hoh - hard to stop eating! Each forkful had its own flavor nuance
Mee Kati Isan - started scooping the sauce that wasn't clinging to the noodles onto our rice so we could eat every bit of it!
Tom Som Pla Kra Pong - the red snapper tasted sweeter than usual in contrast to the other spicy dishes.  I loved the ginger and tamarind broth but others may find it a bit too sharp and spicy
Kao Tod Nam Klook - very good, but  other dishes out shined it

I've never been to Thailand but have eaten at a lot of Thai restaurant all over the city and this place is a keeper!  They have been only open a few months and I'm really hoping they maintain their high standards and never dumb down on the spices!

I've seen a lot of ugly babies in my time (some on Yelp), but this Ugly Baby bites back. If you're into authentic Thai food with a giant spicy kick, then you've come to the right place.

The Khao Soi Nuer (northern egg noodle soup) WILL make you sweat. But that's good. Get all those toxins out. Don't worry, the staff will keep your ice water cup filled. And provide you with more cutesy napkins to dab your forehead.

Portion sizes are also pretty big, so just when you think you can make it through without burning a hole in your stomach, you find a whole 'nother hunk of beef and even more noodles. Yowza.

Their beer list is also surprisingly good. A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one!

Saturday evening, was hit with a 20 minute wait for a table of two. Thankfully there are enough things to do in the area to whittle away time before heading back. After sitting down, didn't feel too cramped despite the tiny interior.

Good variety in the menu for both food and drink. Beer list is especially impressive, eventually deciding on the Lost Nation ""Tossing Seeds"" ($12) - an odd tasting ale that had an almost sour like flavor. For food, ordered the Tum Kanoon ($18) - a combination of pork belly, jackfruit, pork crackling, and greens. Heavy spice in the dish (which you get warned about), and full flavor in the meat. Wasn't able to taste much of/if any jackfruit; also not getting anything out of the burnt jackfruit pieces to the side, apart from a texture change.

For the price and wait, was expecting more from here. Also, a side of rice is $2 extra.

So excited to finally make it to this place! On a Monday evening I popped in at 6:30pm and got seated at 7pm.

It's pretty small inside, but very bright and colorful, which I can say the same about the food and experience. I loved it! They are famous for having very spicy food, but the waiter was really good about warning us. Since it was our first time there, we tried a few of their most popular dishes (the table next to us literally ordered the same 3 things!)

Tue Ka Ko (Coconut Milk Cakes, 5/5): so fun! Little round fried balls that are crumbly like cornmeal, fragrant from the coconut and peanuts on top, sweet chili sauce underneath. Taste one, then save the rest for intermittent relief between the spicy foods.

Khao Soi Nuer (5/5): I LOVE khao soi, and this was hitting all the right spots. Spice level is 8 out of 10 for me, but somehow the extra spice just made me eat it faster. They will warn you about the extra little scoop of chili on top - remove that and taste the dish first. You can always add it back in, but you can't take it out.

Khoong Muk Kai Kem (Shrimp, Squid, & Salted Egg Yolk, 5/5): my friend's favorite dish, and also mine! It is quite a mild spice level, and so delicious from the salty egg yolk sauce. I would love a steamed bun or extra rice to dunk into the rest of the sauce. The seafood is bouncy and fresh, cooked perfectly.

Beef Curry (3.5/5): beef ribs that are falling off the bone tender, in a drier curry with tons of lemongrass, ginger, and bay leaves? Spice level is about 7 out of 10. Personally the flavors didn't speak as much to me, I usually enjoy curries with some coconut milk or something sweet to balance the savory.

We went home directly to get some ice cream to soothe our happy stomachs. I was still feeling fiery 5 hours afterwards, so next time I'll probably go for lunch. Don't let that deter you though - this is some of the most exciting Thai food I've ever had.

This is not your average run of the mill Thai food - you won't find pad thai on the menu. I had also heard from several people that their food is seriously spicy so to go easy. The waiter there was able to recommend 5 items which worked out really well:
Tue ka ko: fried coconut milk cakes (great to start off with these, a bit like cornbread)
Khoong muk kai kem: shrimp, squid, and salted egg (the salted egg really packs a punch, and this was my favorite dish. Medium spicy)
Kang prik: super spicy spareribs with birds eye chili. Brace yourself for this one!
Kao tod nam klook: curried rice, pork skin, ginger (we had this without peanuts but, that pork skin really added some delicious flavor and texture)
Tom sum pla kra pong: red snapper in ginger and tamarind (great soothing ending to some fiery dishes)
The beers complement the spicy food also (I had the Mango mango mango sour ale)

Ugly Baby--what a name! You won't find familiar Thai dishes here like pad thai or tom yum soup, and if you ask someone to read the terribly-fonted menu, they probably wouldn't be able to recognize a thing! But the flavors here are seriously authentic and spicy without reprieve (though they do have non-spicy dishes and recommend getting a mix of dishes for balance). The place is small and loud, but colorfully painted and quirky (the napkins have drawings of cats and baby chicks), and you can see the open kitchen where all the beautifully plated dishes are assembled!

Our very friendly waiter gave us some recommendations, and we started off with the Tue Ka Ko, or fried coconut milk, taro, and black bean fritters topped with crushed peanuts, cilantro, and a sticky sweet-savory sauce. This tasty (non-spicy) appetizer had a crumbly texture and was a good way to prepare the palate for the very spicy dishes to come.. Next came the Kanom Jean Kiew Warn Gai, a dish of green curry with chicken, eggplant, basil, and red chilies, all served over rice noodles. Our waiter had warned us that this was a spicy dish, but still I was not prepared! The first bite doesn't necessarily seem overwhelming, but it just builds and builds, the pain lingering long after, and after it all settles down, you can't help but go for more! I love it!

And finally came my favorite dish of the night, the highly recommended Kao Tod Nam Klook, described as a ""curried rice"" with fermented pork, peanut, and ginger, and served with herbs, green beans, lettuce, and cucumber spears! Parts of the rice had a really crispy fried texture, and the flavor of the soured pork, the crunch of the peanuts, and the freshness of the vegetables all just came together!

What a meal! I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this gem of a restaurant--great service, lively atmosphere, explosive flavors, and amazing value too!

Burn, (Ugly) Baby, burn.

This place certainly lives up to its reputation of exceedingly spicy Thai dishes. We ordered the khao soi nuer (northern egg noodle curry soup with beef shank), tum kanoon (young jackfruit, pork belly, curry paste, and roselle), and tom som pla kra pong (red snapper in ginger and tamarind broth). The red snapper was by far our favorite dish, not only because it was the one mild and therefore manageable dish, but because it was genuinely delicious. The broth was lightly tart and very comforting and full of flavor, while the fish was wonderfully tender... and there was a lot of it.

The khao soi and jackfruit dishes were the same level of spiciness, and both were a bit too much for us to handle. I've tried better khao soi before. Parts of the beef were  unpleasantly tough and chewy. The sauce did have good flavor, though, and I enjoyed the pickled veggies. The jackfruit dish was fine, but not very memorable. I did like the crispiness and saltiness of the pork rinds and fried roselle leaves that came with it, and it wasn't quite as searingly spicy as the khao soi because it was a drier dish.

I'm really not sure why they can't alter the spice level of their food. It makes sense if only 10-20% of the menu boasts very spicy dishes... not 90%. The duck laab is literally listed as ""stay-away spicy."" There comes a point when the spice level is so high that it just ruins the enjoyment of a dish for me because that's all I can taste.

As someone who has a pretty high threshold for spice & drenches everything in it, I must say this place was absolutely amazing. It was incredibly spicy, very brutal. But walked in super excited, had an awesome sauce meal, and crawled out tearing but totally satisfied.

Do yourself a favor & grab a refreshing drink while you have your meal. The Thai Iced Tea was very refreshing! The staff was very friendly, they kept giving me cucumbers (supposed to help with the spice!) because they knew I was dying. Thank you!

Kua Kling - Southern Dry Eye Round Curry
Let's start with the spices dish shall we? This dish was very flavorful (yes, you can still taste it). But I must say after like the 7th bite I was like okay, I need rice, which made it even better! It's that dish that's too spicy, but it's so good, so you eat it anyway!

Khoong Yang Aroy Aroy - Ayuthaya's Grilled Prawns
Big fan of prawns & these definitely did not disappoint. Yes, they're spicy, but also fat & seasoned so well. If you're one of those people who's lazy to peel the shell, get over it. This one's worth it!

Pla Tod Kamin - Fried Turmeric Sea Bream
This was probably my favorite plate of my meal! The fish was cooked very nicely - soft on the inside & crispy on the outside. The spice level was okay compared to the other two so if you need a break, definitely the dish to get. Loved it!

One of the best Thai restaurant in Brooklyn. If you can handle the heat, the spiciness-go try this place out. A small store with limited seats and a small bar area so be prepared to wait. We got there early, before 6:30pm and got seated quickly. But the place got full by 7pm so plan wisely people. The waitresses were courteous and explained their dishes and recommended which dishes paired together taste good. They tell you when arrived at your table that most of their dishes are spicy. We chose the fried turmeric sea bream (a must!) and the northern egg noodle curry soup with beef shank (also a must!) This pair was recommended by the server since we really wanted the sea bream and she recommended the noodle, which is pretty spicy and blended well with the fish which wasn't.
Amazing food. These two dishes were enough for 2 people. All their dishes are shareable and everyone can try other dishes if you go with a large party. But you probably shouldnt since it is a small space. The dishes came out fast but bc we were seated near the entrance, our food got cold pretty fast since people kept coming in and out. They have a very heavy curtain to try to block the wind but it makes exiting and entering very difficult. Had a hard time moving the curtain. There is one gender neutral bathroom. Overall, will be back to try more of their dishes!

I'd heard rave reviews about Ugly Baby ever since it opened, but hadn't had the chance to go due to its popularity and location. Finally got the chance to drop in on a weekday evening during the holiday season. Even though we walked in approximately 3 minutes after the restaurant opened, there were already several tables taken, so this place is clearly still very popular.

Of course the one thing that everyone knows about this place is the unforgiving spice in the dishes - no substitutions or replacements, thanks. Ugly Baby definitely lived up to all those rumors.

We ordered the coconut milk cakes, khao soi, and kao ta nam kloot. Thought we had it easy with the coconut milk cakes, but the waiter laughed when he saw us struggling through the kao ta nam kloot (supposedly a mild dish), and warned us that our final dish would be really spicy. We should've known better than to defy his warning, and had to give up on the khao soi after just a few (delicious) bites. The waiter helpfully brought us some cucumber slices to cool down our mouths, but it was too late for us. Despite our failure, Ugly Baby was a success and we loved every bit of food that we could stuff down.

Highly recommend - come early to get a seat, and order a side of Thai iced tea to cool down that heat.

Restaurant Overview - While the eclectic, hipster-painted walls make this little Brooklyn-based Thai restaurant feel welcoming when you walk past the colorful draperies, do not let your guard down - your taste buds are in for an arduous (and spicy) journey.

The Service - Arrived around 5:45 PM on a Saturday night and left my phone number with the hostess while I waited 45 min with a nice cocktail at Brooklyn Social just two blocks up the road. Be sure to arrive early if dining with a mid-sized party (i.e. 5+ people), especially on the weekends as the wait can be stretched deeper into the night.

Once seated, our waiter was extremely friendly and provided us with a well thought out, 3-course dining plan for the evening: one non-spicy dish, one mildly spicy dish, and one extremely hot dish. In addition, he maintained our supply of cucumbers which is crucial for getting through this dining experience.

The Food - Started out with the Tue Ka Ko which consists of sticky and sweet fried coconut milk cakes with black bean and taro. Garnished with crumbled peanuts, this dish served as a flavorful appetizer.

Up next was the Kao Tod Nam Klook, a cold yet mildly spicy salad dish that served as the perfect ""heat step up"" from the Tue Ka Ko. Consisting of curried rice, pork skin, peanut & ginger, this dish is best eaten like a lettuce wrap.

Finally, the main event: Kang Hoh. This dish is not for the spicy-weak. Made up of pork shoulder, spare ribs & noodles coated with Hung Le, a Northern Thai curry, the Kang Hoh offers a wonderful aroma of spices that kicks your taste buds with tastiness and heat.

TL;DR  - A fantastic, authentic Thai experience tucked away in Carroll Gardens that will strain yet please even the most experienced spicy-eaters.

For years, I was under the impression that Queens was the boss when it came to Thai food. My go to joints were SriPra Phai, Zabb Elee (now closed) to name a few. I never thought of Thai food in Brooklyn as a thing.

Then one day, I asked about Ugly Baby in Carroll Gardens. I had seen the place while passing by several times and decided one night it was worth investigation. Boy was it a worthy visit. Queens move over, Brooklyn has hit the jackpot with Ugly Baby. Now, to be forthcoming, this place is not for everyone and I mean the food. As one could discern from some of the other reviews, if Spicy is not your thing, then this mother of all Thai houses is not your home. Leave it to folks like myself.

The food is exceptionally good. Scrumptious and the best part. Spicy AF! This is not your ""Americanized"" Thai food. This is legit, the real deal and as someone who has visited Thailand, the food here is spicier than many places there. Alas, some of those places in Thailand have fallen victim to the tourist demands of fried and non spicy...UGH!

But I digress. Ugly Baby is small. A tight squeeze for dining but cozy enough. The wait can be tough for those of you accustomed to short waits. On busy days, especially Friday nights it could be up to an hour.  Be prepared for 30-45 mins wait. I recommend getting there early. That way you get a shot at all the dishes before they run out of some items. You don't want to miss Pla Tod Kamin which is a a sea bream in fried Tumeric or the Pork Ribs with Fresh Bird Eye Chilis (spicy and delicious) or the brutally spicy Kua Kling.

The service is solid and the staff quite nice but don't expect the service to be at your beck and call. They are busy, busy, busy. I always like to get a spot where I could watch the magic in the kitchen and where sometimes I get to raise a glass in toast to a job well done. Thanks to all off you at Ugly Baby for making some of the best Thai Food around. I have now tasted pretty much everything on your menu. Please don't ever change

I've been hankering for a meal here since they opened nearly two years ago. In that time I must've built up Ugly Baby to be a bastion of authentic flavors, a haven for spice lovers, a place where they warn you the food is gonna make you sweat, and they mean it. And sure, the food was pretty spicy. But tasty? I'm second guessing some of that now.

A part of me feels like maybe my group ordered the wrong dishes. But considering we ordered 5 items off the menu, that's enough of a menu sampling to make a determination about their kitchen, right?

The sea bream was highly recommended by our server, as were the coconut cakes. We took his word and were a bit underwhelmed. The sea bream was a whole fish that had been deep fried so much that most of the edges were burnt, and the fish itself didn't have a lot of meat on it. A lot of bones, though.

The coconut cakes came in a nice sweet sauce and were crispy on the edges. This is definitely a good dish for vegetarians, as it's one of the few veggie friendly items on the menu, but it's nothing special.

The most flavorful dish we ordered was the khao soi. Lots of texture in this dish from the crunchy noodles, noodles and cilantro. And the soup was very delicious, and in my opinion the right amount of spicy.

We ordered the pork belly salad and green curry dishes as well, but much of the dishes were left untouched, which says something to me. I think these dishes were lacking a wow factor, I very much felt that I could've ordered these dishes from my local Thai spot.

I'd totally give it another try to taste their other dishes.

Ugly Baby is a Thai restaurant that is unapologetic about their spice levels as well as their cake service fee of $25. With that said, I will probably not be back. Their spice level is too much, even for me.

I can't stress enough that this is a spicy restaurant. If you love spice, then this is the restaurant for you. Bonus points if you have wanderlust for Thailand or miss Thailand. This is 100% legit Thai spice. I needed two cups of Thai Iced Tea to regain my sight back and calm down my mouth which was on fire. Other people had sweat pouring out of their heads and runny noses. You have been warned!

With that said, the staff is really great and patient to walk you through the menu which does not include any typical Thai dishes like pad thai or thai basil fried rice. The food at Ugly Baby are complex dishes which use all sorts of Thai spices and special chilis. We picked the most tame items hoping to be edible for our palates.

For seven people we ordered:

Pla Tod Kamin (fried tumeric sea bream) NOT SPICY
Kao Tod Nam Kloot (curried rice) NOT SPICY
Kang Hoh (Northern dry hung le + red curry paste w/ pork shoulder, spare ribs, mung bean noodles) SPICY
Curried Shrimp SPICY
Kanom Jean Kiew Warn (vermicelli, chicken, spicy green curry, bird eye chilis) SPICY
Khoa Soi Nuer (egg noodle, curry soup, beef shank) VERY SPICY

Please note that SPICY is really very spicy and VERY SPICY is extremely spicy. I don't think my words even convey how spicy the food is here. You just have to taste is for yourself. And all you will taste is spice.

Good luck!

So much flavor, yet so much BURN!

Our waitress did her due diligence in thoroughly warning us how spicy the majority of dishes, particularly all the curries, come.
Her guidance was necessary because the menu won't give you many clues. Cause this place is just that authentic: no basic pad thai nor picture guides in sight. Just straight up original dish names and some lists of ingredients that would still stump a neophyte.

We went with the one of the waitress's recommendations of medium dishes to try--the curried rice--and then ventured on our own cause me and my dining mate are comfortable eating spicy. So, we just HAD to test the limits. We also ordered the fried coconut dough balls and the green curry with chicken and rice vermicelli.

All dishes are made to be shared. It would seem like a lot of the craft beers are too given their size and prices! I'll have to return and investigate that further some other time. This go around I settled with a sour from upstate, which was a solid choice.

Our food came out rather swiftly and we went straight into the curried rice. SO MUCH FLAVOR. In fact, it was a little too citrus forward for me at first. And, it was legit on the medium-hot end of spiciness. It was super yummy, but definitely full of kick. Made me ripe with nervousness at just how much spicier the curry could possibly be...

SO. MUCH. SPICIER! Yes, the curry was rich, the chicken tender, the noodles slurp-slurpy. But eating this dish was exactly how videos of habanero or ghost pepper challenges go: you're fine for the first 15-30 seconds, and then the burn sets in. By the time I finished 5 bites, my mouth was on fire--tongue burning, saliva pooling, eyes watering. After that, the curried rice level of spice tasted below mild, and we gobbled it up desperate to swallow away the remainder of the curry burn.

We should've order a ton of rice on the side and milk drinks like I noticed other tables did. Though I'll admit, glancing around, few people seemed to have ordered our dish. It quite possibly be the hottest curry on the menu for all I know. But besides the small setback of that dish being inedible for us, I really enjoyed the explosions of delicious flavors and bursts of color throughout the restaurant's decor. While not cooling enough for me on a hot summer day, I see myself a regular adventure once autumn hits.

Ain't nothing ugly about this baby. This is JonBenet Ramsey right here (minus the tragic death). Worth the trek to Brooklyn for real Thai food with real Thai flavors--none of that watered down, Americanized crap so prevalent in Manhattan.

Try the Tum Kanoon to see jackfruit done right, the Laab Ped Udon for real duck salad, and the Pad Tua Ngok Rau Kao if you need some fiber with your protein. Only complaint I had was that the spicy dishes were nowhere near as spicy as I would've liked. I guess for that, I'll still need to go back to Somtum Der (ironically, in Manhattan).

- Superstar A+ service
- Waitress had great suggestions
- I like the, you get what you get attitude. No replacements of items on the menu to make it less spicy
- This is not your traditional Thai (no pad Thai or drunken noodles here)
- The sauce on the coconut cakes is worth the price alone
- loved the fried fish (its not spicy)
- The beef shank is good, but spicy (I liked to try it, but I wouldn't order it)
- Went on a Tuesday at 8pm, and there was one table left
- Cool soundtrack
- Tasty wine

""According to the surgeon general, if you eat this food while pregnant, your baby will be ugly."" *

* The surgeon general may or may not have actually said this, just my friends, but I've never been pregnant and eaten here so I can neither confirm nor deny. But if you want to test this theory- and/or cry tears of pain/joy- I highly recommend a trip to Ugly Baby.

This is not a place you go for pad thai or similar basic dishes. This is also not a place you bring those who can't handle spice (me) without prior warning. But if you're looking to try seriously cool and creative Thai dishes (and maybe cry a little), Ugly Baby is a good place to start.

Everything is spicy - literally everything. But in return for a little pain, you'll be rewarded with a variety of funky sweet, sour, umami, and salty notes that you rarely taste all in one dish. I highly recommend gathering a group of your bravest friends and sharing in the pain together.

The little coconut and corn muffins were an excellent starter. The fried whole fish was both crispy and succulent. Their khao soi was an excellent and hearty dish, with plenty of curry broth, beef, and crispy noodles. I actually found this dish spicier than their infamous green curry, which apparently was the spiciest dish on the menu. At this point in the meal, I may have been hallucinating and/or numb from the spice, so it was hard to tell.

The staff is more than happy to give recommendations, and will liberally warn you if they think your weak American tastebuds aren't up to the challenge. You should definitely listen to them, but also not be afraid to get outside of your comfort zone, because you will be rewarded with so many delicious flavors.

Anyways, eat here. Just be prepared to set your mouth on fire (and potentially ruin the aesthetics of your future children- a worthy risk, if you ask me).

Was really excited about visiting this spot after hearing all the hype about it from locals and social media. We got there at 11:55am on a Sunday (5 min before they opened) to make sure that we could get in without a long wait. There were a couple parties waiting outside already, but we were able to get seated right away when the clock turned 12.

We braced ourselves for the spice, ordering: Kao Tod Nam Klook (mild/medium), Kang Hoh (medium), and Laab Ped Udon (one of the spiciest dishes). While they were spicy, nothing was unbearable. However, it would have been nice to receive rice as a side. We only received a small portion of sticky rice with one of the dishes.

Our favorite was definitely the Kang Hoh. The glass noodles and pork shoulder were superb. We split the three dishes among three people, and honestly at the end we couldn't tell if we were full (the portions are kind of on the smaller end) or if we were just full of heat from the spice.

Everything on the menu is really interesting, and you won't see Pad Thai or Pad See Ew like you do at other Thai restaurants. It's definitely a place to check out if you are a bit on the adventurous side.

Stepping back in here to update my previous review. The first time I had Ugly Baby I was mostly embittered by the fact that the pickup time quoted was really off. Fast forward almost a year and Ugly Baby is definitively my favorite Thai place in the city.

After now having tried most things on the menu I can say that the Kang Ho and Khao Soi (especially the latter) are my favorites. The Kua Kling is amazing but BEWARE: it is the spiciest thing I have ever eaten before in my life. This place is no joke and makes the spiciness at Boons and Som Tum Der look like absolutely childs' play. Make sure to have a tall glass of milk next to you at all times while eating.

Service is continually great. Had a wonderful birthday there this past year.

Super mixed feelings about this spot. On one hand, the food is solid. However, I was hoping it would stack up with the likes of Uncle Boons (my favorite Thai in the city but frequently inaccessible thanks to some serious hype, and consequently minimum 2 hour waits at peak times), and it just didn't.

I ordered the Kang Ho, which contains pork shoulder, spare ribs, and mungbean noodles. At $17, it's considerably cheaper than any of the entrees on Uncle Boons' menu. The portion size was solid - I was totally satiated after eating without being uncomfortably stuffed. I was hoping it would be a little spicier than it was - I found the dish to be relatively mild (maybe 4/10 spice-wise), although at one point I did bite into an angry-looking red pepper that set my mouth ablaze and had me feeling some type of way for the rest of the night.

I had ordered take-out, but went into the restaurant to pick it up. It's tight on the inside, possibly a little smaller than I would like, and there isn't much seating. It has a fairly casual vibe and lends itself better to a dinner with a close friend than a date spot. I do believe it's still BYOB, though, which is a total game-changer. Not sure if there's a corkage fee, but I can absolutely get behind not racking up a $100+ bill on booze alone.

Would have been 4 stars except for a frustrating experience with delivery. I live about 30 mins from Ugly Baby (it's my boyfriend's neighbor, however) and I called right before I left my apartment to place the order and was quoted 45 minutes, which was perfect. However, less than 15 minutes later I get a call saying my food is ready. I suppose I appreciate the promptness, but this meant that it was sitting out and getting cold.

TL;DR: Would return but the fact that it's BYOB has a lot to do with that. Anywhere else but NYC Ugly Baby would really hold its own, but with so many great Thai choices around it barely makes a blip on the radar.

Ok, first...the name is HILARIOUS. We've all seen them and yet no one acknowledges that there are such things. But I digress. The entire menu is spicy so if you are not looking for spice, this is not the place for you. But if you are looking for flavor filled yummy food. This is a great place. It is also small. If you want a table here. Optimal times are an hour before closing or at the start of the round.

Worth the 6 hour flight, 1 hour subway, and 20 minute walk in freezing winds. The best Thai food I've had, inside or outside of Thailand. They're not joking about the spice- take your server's advice seriously! Ask for sticky rice on the side. To round out the meal, you must get the Thai tea to soothe your burning tongue.

This was really outstanding, and just as spicy as everyone says it is.

First visit, we got the tue ka ko (small coconut cakes), kang kua supparod (mushroom pineapple curry), khoong muk kai kem (a mix of shrimp and squid), and kanom jean kiew warn gai (vermicelli noodles in a green curry sauce). I would have a hard time not ordering any of the first three next time -- all of them were incredible. The shrimp and squid dish had a pretty perfect spice level for me (probably a bit too hot for my wife, but she still really enjoyed it). The mushroom pineapple curry was one of my favorite Thai dishes I've ever eaten -- the sauce alone was so good, I downed the entire bowl. The green curry was our least favorite, and also the spiciest -- I'm not sure that it was actually the spice level that put it below the others, but we probably wouldn't get it again.

Can't wait to come back and try more stuff -- this would be a great spot to come with a group of more than two so that we can share more. (That duck salad is supposed to be incredibly spicy and I'd love to get that next time around.)

Ugly Baby is, without a doubt, the best Thai restaurant I've yet experienced in this city--or really, anywhere. I'm no expert, but to the best degree I can tell, it's got ""real"" authentic Thai food. No pad thais or standard green/red curries here; instead, you'll find an incredible array of new and exciting dishes, ALL of which look equally appealing.

We went with the Khao Sui Nuer and Shrimp, Squid, and Egg Yolk, which was plenty for the two of us. The Khao Sui Nuer comes with a fiery curry sauce on the side that you can titrate in to your liking, but be careful--it's really, really good *and* really, really potent. The shrimp and squid dish is a little milder, but equally fantastic. It's not as spicy, but very flavorful with coconut- and tamarind-ish notes. I'd highly recommend both.

If anything, our only regret here was not having a larger group to share (and try) more dishes. That being said, it's a small-ish space, so I wouldn't plan for more than 4, maybe max. 6.

A few other notes. First, the staff here are excellent. There's a lot to work with on the menu, and they were great with helping us find something well suited to our preferences. Second, the place is simple and has a sort of hole-in-the-wall charm, but the quirky, rainbow decor adds to the fun of the whole experience. And finally, this is one of the best ""value-for-quality"" deals in the city. Most entrees are in the $15-20 range, with generous, very much splittable portions.

In short: Ugly Baby is freaking great. Go ASAP.

Unfathomably spicy. Unreasonably spicy. So spicy I am seriously advising you to not go because it's too spicy.
Seriously, we were advised against getting the duck noodle because it is ""10 out of 10 spicy"" so instead got the (beef shank) khao soi which was ""medium spicy"" and the pork rind salad. Nope! Khao soi was so uncomfortably spicy that we just gave up and boxed it up to dilute threefold with more noodles or rice later. It might have been still tasty in the meanwhile but we were too busy crying and wiping the waterfall of sweat off our brows to really tell.
The fried pork skin salad was nice though. Still spicy, but the pork rind, peanuts, fried rice (like actual crunchy chunks), romaine, and cucumber pair with the 11/10 extra-loud mint-cilantro-lime-fish sauce flavors well.
I will give them credit for sticking to their guns and their reputation. The servers are very kind and open about their menu and advise you appropriately, but apparently both the kitchen and service really stick to their guns about not turning down their spice level. Why??

Well don't go here if you can't handle spice. I'm pretty good with spicy food and even I needed a little water break whilst digging in to my kao sa. It was delicious the meat was tender and the flavors were balanced despite the spice. We also got the fried sea bream...to me this fish was not spicy and it balanced out the other one. All in all a great experience except that the bar seating isn't very steady or comfortable.

I'm going to start the review of this really outstanding restaurant with a tip:
Order your ""Family Style"" meal no more than two dishes at a time! We ordered all six dishes when the waiter asked us what we wanted and us three souls sitting at a 3ft. X 3ft. table were inundated with plates, serving spoons, dipping sauces and any other things they could throw at us. I actually started eating with an order of *Sia Tod (pork intestines) sitting on lap; our table was THAT crowded!
But, with that being my only gripe at this restaurant, our Thai dinner here was not only one of the most original Thai dinners I've ever had, it was in the top 3 (out of Hundreds) in terms of taste and heat and presentation.

So besides the pig intestines sitting on my lap we had:
*Kang Prik - spare ribs in a bird's eye chili curry that was really good
*Khoong Muk Kaikem - squid and shrimp with a salted egg that just knocked me out. I would come back just for an order of this and a beer
*Lab Ped Udon - which was a rich and deep Udon with shredded duck meat in a deconstructed salad......simply divine / very different
*Pla Tod Kamin - this was a fried whole Sea Bream just dosed with turmeric spice. Sublime!
Tue Ka Ko - these delicious fried coconut milk cakes with black beans and taro rounded out this damn perfect dinner.

This place is small and gets VERY crowded so expect some wait time. The staff is friendly and accommodating in every respect and this dinner is not inexpensive, but with what your getting and the originality of this food makes it well worth the price of admission.

We don't know if it was the freezing situation at the tables near the door or the spiciness of the dishes but we were quite disappointed with our dinner here.

After reading so many positive reviews, we've decided it's about time to trek to 4th street on a cold winter night to try Ugly Baby. Compared to our first attempt, this time it didn't take us long to be seated, but near the door.

We found the tables so close to each other that private/intimate conversation is not expected here. Our waiter however was genuinely helpful and she discussed with us the spicy levels of each of the dishes.

We started with a bottle of IPA beer and ordered the fried sea bream, pigs tongue and pork belly with shrimp paste, it was served in timely fashion although it gotten really cold as soon as they put it on our table. In fact it was so cold we could not even remove our jackets and beanies because of the temperature, my lower body was freezing, it was that bad!

I hope that the management would read this and do something with the door situation specially in winter time, as I said we didn't enjoy our dinner this time but will keep an open mind to come back in warmer weather.

Went for a late lunch on a weekend to avoid the long wait. Was seated in about 25 minutes.

In short: Ugly Baby is fine, but a bit overhyped. People make the mistake of calling the food here super-authentic just because it's spicier than they're used to. And while there are some dishes here that you'd be hard pressed to find on other menus in the city, there were some liberties taken: for example, for all the time I lived in Thailand, I never saw a green curry served over rice vermicelli.

The food is good and pretty spicy, but it's not going to kill you. Just step up and try it. The overall heat level is still not as aggressive as you'd see in Thailand, so it is toned down somewhat for western palates. Ped samrap farang :)

I was disappointed when they were out of some of my top choices on the menu. They were fresh out of Khao Soi when I went for a late lunch. They were also out of a beef dish (I forget which), so I settled on my third choice, the green chicken curry on rice vermicelli. It was fine, but not spectacular. They might have taken the spice too far on the green curry, too: there was enough chili in there that the curry was red, not a more typical (and authentic) milky green. Don't get me wrong, I'm a card-carrying spice junkie, but green curry isn't usually spiced that aggressively. I couldn't help but think that the heat was being used as a gimmick here.

The service is also interesting. The staff were great; nothing wrong with them. My dish came out first, then my wife's fish dish arrived quite a bit later. My curry was lukewarm by the time her main course came out. I know Thai food is often served family style, but when they serve such polarizing food (too spicy for many), they should expect that some folks there will be ordering individual dishes, not family style. Perhaps clarify with customers up front whether the dishes should be brought out together, or as they are ready?

All in all this was tasty food and I appreciate that they dial up the heat a bit compared to some other Thai restaurants. I just can't justify waiting for more than an hour for a meal here, as many seem to do.

This is the spicy Thai food, not the typical pad Thai or drunken noodle type of Thai food. The restaurant focuses on Northern Thai food. We ordered:
- Mushroom pineapple curry
- Mixed seafood
We were both crying while eating but it was so tasty!

It was great to be able to dine inside at Capital Grille again.  We had taken out from them since the pandemic began but ventured back in for the first time for dinner on an early Saturday evening.

What we noticed immediately was that the tables being used were nicely separated for social distancing. We felt very comfortable eating indoors there, probably more so than any other restaurant that we could think of.

As for the food, our favorite steak, the porcini rubbed ribeye with balsamic was as good as ever. The lamb chops were also excellent.

The service was also terrific. Brett, who has been our server in past visits also, was again friendly and helpful.

Hope to be back soon!

Went back to The Capital Grille - Wall Street on a Saturday evening and it was relatively quiet in the restaurant. Had a burger from the Wagyu and Wine menu and it was terrific. Great burger and great promotion!  Brett our server was also very friendly and helpful.  Will definitely be back.

The Delmonico Steak here is arguably among one of the best steaks that I have ever had (and I have been to many steakhouses: Sparks, Palm, Peter Lugers, Morton's, Wolfgang's, Del Frisco's, Ruth's Chris, etc) - the flavor is simply amazing. The Lobster and Crab Cakes Appetizer and the Flourless Chocolate Expresso Cake Dessert were also excellent. What impressed me more in my most recent visit (3/3/2012) though was the service that we received. When my wife commented to the waiter that she was cold, he promptly adjusted the air conditioning. My wife was also having problems with one of her knees and the manager who walks around the restaurant checking on the customers graciously asked if there was anything he could do to help.  After we had left the restaurant, the manager saw through the restaurant windows that my wife was hobbling down the street and he rushed out of the restaurant asking if he could help call us a taxi. Now that is customer service.

So it's Covid-19 and I need to treat my wife cause she's been cooking for weeks. Cooking is not my forte. Fact is: I don't have many options. But what I do have is The Capital Grille. Amazing chefs, fantastic food, trusted delivery. If you're in the FiDi area, I suggest treating your lady. Everybody wins.

My office is right down the block and I used to dine here all the time for business lunch and after work for about 8years before COVID. Impeccable service and amazing food. Always made reservations and never had to wait more than 5min to be seated. Every single staff here is well trained and very polished. Everything I've tried on the menu was delicious. Great food and dining experience guaranteed! You just can't go wrong with this place. It's my favorite place in financial district!

I had a reservation for a party of 4 in celebration of my birthday wth friends. I've eaten at capital grille before at a different location and even though it's a steakhouse and I'm meat free I wanted to make sure the meat lovers had a great time. I settled for the crab cakes and salmon and everyone else had the filet mignon, Brussels sprout , mashed potatoes and lamb
Ashley was our server and she was excellent. She kept the drinks rolling in and made sure we were all good .
My guests all had a wonderful time and enjoyed their food . Service was excellent , pricey but worth every penny. Loved it ! Second time around and I've been pleased with the service and happy that I shared  the experience  with friends

NYC Winter 2020 Restaurant Week (RW) Lunch review

I came here yesterday with 11 other colleagues for RW lunch. Reservations were easy to make thanks to OpenTable app. We were given a private room since there were so many of us and it was pretty nice to have a room to ourselves. So for RW lunch, you had to pick an appetizer and entree which costs $26 without tax & tips. Some colleagues ordered drinks (i.e soda or iced tea) that was $4.25 each for themselves.

I ordered the Caesar salad for appetizer.
The salad was fresh and delicious. For entree, I ordered the roasted chicken and it comes with mushroom parmesan risotto. There also some chopped up pieces of asparagus in the risotto as well. This dish was super filling and I didn't expect that there would be two big pieces of chicken breasts. I definitely enjoyed my meal. I was so full and I took some of my leftovers home.

Service was good. Our waitress was very friendly and nice. Although, it took awhile to get our entrees. At least everyone's food came out all at once. Overall, definitely come to Capital Grille for RW and take advantage of RW menu offerings!

I realize this place is part of a chain, but they do a really great job. I went last night to celebrate my own birthday and all the staff was so accommodating, addresssd me by name from the start, and just treated me first class the whole way.

I had a half dozen oysters with a cocktail. They were very fresh and briney.  Then the porcini rubbed bone in ribeye with a half order of creamed spinach. The steak was cooked perfectly.  They provided a birthday desert that included a flourless chocolate thing that was really great.

I truly appreciate being treated like a VIP and will totally come back.

Every Valentines Day we do a steakhouse. This year, we chose the Capital Grille, Fidi edition. We had easily the best table in the restaurant. It was upstairs, in a private little room, overlooking the rest of the restaurant. Had a round of martinis to start which were excellent. We ordered a bunch of appetizers for the table to share. The lobster Mac and cheese, crab cocktail, oysters and the spicy calamari. All were great but the lobster Mac was the winner of this round. Big pieces of lobster always makes it great. For my entree I had the Bone in Kona which was cooked perfectly and an amazing piece of meat. Add on sides of truffle fries, creamed spinach and mashed potatoes? A perfect meal.

This was one of the discreet restaurants by my office that I knew was very upscale and I really wanted to try someday. Thank goodness for restaurant week. $26 (before tax and gratuity) 2 course lunch menu  special woot woot !
Ambience: very regal  (we reserved for 12 people so we got a private room). The bathroom was very clean and had a full length mirror.
Service: excellent! The waiters were coming around frequently to assist us with anything we needed.
Food:
For the starter, I went with the new England clam chowder. To be honest, it just tasted like glorified hale and hearty soup. There's only so much you can do with clam chowder.
For the main course, I had the seared salmon. It was really good except I didn't understand why it didn't come with pilaf or some sort of side dish. I'm certainly not used to eating salmon on its own. Overall I like the texture and it wasn't dry.
Soft drinks were 4.25 each (rolls eyes)

Overall I'm glad I had a chance to finally experience this restaurant.

I finally got the chance to experience restaurant week and picked the best place to start - The Capital Grille. The restaurant was beautiful, elegant and classic. In the historic Equitable Building, what was once a mighty bank vault is now the entrance to the private dinning rooms on the lower level. Just stunning, don't forget to check it out.

For starters we ordered the Clam Chowder and Green Salad w/ Parmesan vinaigrette. The clam chowder was soft, creamy and had a substantial amount of clam in each bite. Now, I'm a fan of green salads but this had to be the best salad dressing I've ever had. I loveeeee Parmesan cheese and the vinaigrette was exactly what I was hoping it would be. I ate every single bite of the salad and really could gone for more.

We ordered a Blackberry Bourbon cocktail and an Old Fashion. The blackberry  bourbon drink was delish, just the right blend to accompany the mouth watering steak.
We ordered just about the same thing, the Bone-In Dry Aged NY Strip 14oz, one with lobster, one with jumbo shrimp and both with mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were just melt in your mouth creamy. It was such a great side to the steak. He ordered his steak medium and mine medium - rare. When they arrived to the table his steak wasn't cooked to his liking and the waiter Donavon noticed by the look on his face. Donavan asked him if he wanted to order another steak to his exact liking, he hesitated for a bit but then went with Donavon's suggestion to ""eat the steak exactly the way you want it."" Moments later Donavan returned with a steak cooked medium- rare that was exactly how he wanted. Thank goodness Donavan asked him a couple of times because it was really worth the extra little wait. I genuinely appreciated Donavan's attention to detail and vibe. Donavan was just a delight, exceptional service, fun and very helpful.  His service was 10/10.

Oh and just when we thought we were done, the desserts arrived. Hello chocolate cakes! First bite into the cake and I knew this was the right decision. The cake was served with raspberries on the side which allowed for a wonderful blend of sweetness from the cake and a bit of tartness from the raspberry. I really didn't have enough space to finish the entire cake but I did my absolute best.
I highly recommend this location we had a wonderful dining experience and can't wait to comeback.

I've been to this restaurant several times for lunch in the past and each time was great in every way. How can anyone top this?... by going there for lunch during restaurant week! My party of three ordered the pan seared salmon, roasted chicken breast and the signature cheese burger from their set menu. Our appetizers were the Field Greens Salad with Parmesan Vinaigrette and the New England Clam Chowder. Everything was delicious although the lack of side vegetables for the salmon and missing garnish for the burger was noticed when compared to my previous restaurant week dining last year.

If you want the absolute best Ribeye steak sandwich you have to go to one of the Capital Grille locations. The steak is literally cooked to perfection - medium rare! The French loaf looks like it will be very hard to bite into until you actually do and it's that flawless crunch on the outside with the soft breading on the inside. Also, it comes with a pairing of caramelized onions and havatri cheese that finish off this amazing combo!
The sandwich also comes with Parmesan truffle fries! Now, I am not a huge fan when the fries are loaded with truffles and parmesan, but at The Capital Grille they use just the right amount of seasoning! Waiter and waitresses are very welcoming and want to make your experience very enjoyable. One caveat, this meal is only served at lunch, not dinner. Their dinner menu is great but I like lunch time because it's a little cheaper for us frugal folk.

Always been a big fan of Capital Grille and been to several different locations. This was my first time to this location and I met a few friends after work. We visited because it was restaurant week. I ordered the field greens for a starter, grilled chicken with mushroom risotto and creme brulee for dessert. Everything was great. I know it was pretty busy so the service was a little slow. But our servers were very nice and welcoming.

My Aussie friend and I decided to come to this location for lunch since we went to midtown location the week before. I told her Hubby and I have been to midtown location for anniversary, the one in NJ for birthdays and the one in Garden City too. So yes, we are Capital Grille enjoyers! After introducing this restaurant to my Aussie friend, she loved it a lot, so, that's why we're here again.

I enjoy coming here because of the warm welcome from  professional staff plus the good meals. We had Tim as our waiter that afternoon. He was very good. We ordered two types of filet mignon. My friend ordered the 10 oz steak entree and I had from the lunch menu the 8 oz filet mignon. My sliced filet mignon served with the mushroom and her whole filet mignon came alone but we ordered a side of grilled asparagus. First they gave me a whole piece like hers, which we immediately knew it wasn't from the lunch menu and we mentioned to our waiter and without any hesitation he took care of it right away. It might have been a miscommunication because my friend ordered the regular entree filet mignon. This is what I love about coming here because the entire operation is a problem-free environment where the staffers were trained very well how to handle the customers. I must say that everything was excellent! I had salmon the week before at their midtown location. That too was amazing! Just check my salmon photo from midtown location. At the end, we were both satisfied with the meals and ready to explore NY again. Believe it or not the next day my friend is ready for another filet mignon! No way, I said.

The restaurant, the food, the ambience and the staff were excellent! I would go back in a heartbeat.

I came here the other night to celebrate a birthday dinner and we had a great time. The food and drinks were delicious you won't leave here hungry; we did have to send the steaks back 2x to get it at the right temperature we ordered medium well and we received medium rare. They even gifted us with a complimentary birthday dessert. We even took a little time to visit the famous vault downstairs- overall it was a good experience.

Came here with friends for Restaurant Week.
This was my second time at a Capital Grille, my first time was at the Garden City location and I've been craving it ever since, so when I saw that they were participating in restaurant week I knew that I had to go.

We came at our reservation time and were seated promptly by the hostess. Our server was great and very attentive the whole time.

For apps, we ordered the clam chowder and salad, both of which were pretty tasty. For entrees, two of us ordered the ribeye with green beans and one of my friends ordered the filet mignon, (which were all cooked to perfection) with mashed potatoes and we all shared an order of the lobster Mac & cheese, which is mouth-watering. For dessert we all got the cheesecake which was the best cheesecake I've ever had. I think it's safe to say that we all thoroughly enjoyed our meals.

I can't wait to go back again! Even if it's just for the cheesecake!

This was my first time here and we came to celebrate a friend's birthday. We we're running late but the staff was still kind and courteous. On the table was a birthday card and birthday confetti, It was so sweet and thoughtful I had no idea the staff would do this.

The waiter was very kind to give us plenty of time to select our appetizers and entree.

We ordered Hennessy sidecar which was very good. The calamari was light and crispy but salty and the lobster crab cake was perfectly delicious and portion size was good for one person.

I ordered the scallops with risotto; AMAZING! The scallops melted in my mouth and the risotto was divinely cooked and seasoned well.

When I have heard of Capital Grille it seems synonymous with high end service and food. Ifoe an appetizer I had the tuna tartare with avocado and crisp bread. Delicious with the only exception of mentioning mango in the description with only a small bit in the sauce. I was expecting more to layer the flavors. For the main course I had the dry aged steak au poivre which was perfectly encrusted with an absolutely deliciously buttery sauce that was wonderful to savor. Brussel sprouts perfectly cooked and wonderfully charred. And I was too full for dessert. And brought home enough for a second meal.
My only disappointment was that our drink glasses were dirty when wine was poured in. They were replaced and comped.  And also our orders got mixed up and the guest of honor did not get what she ordered. Again this was perfectly corrected with the expected apologizing.
The atmosphere is reminded me of someplace I would go to after a fox hunt  with a few dead animal heads on the walls. As the evening went on and the light started to fade the lighting got darker. Almost a bit too dark for a business dinner.
Price is what I would expect at a high end steak house  if I could give half stars this would be four and a half.

Five Stars. A must visit while in NY. The chef came outside with lunch for my 4 co-workers and I. The food was delicious and fresh. We appreciate everything about this restaurant. Cleanliness and customer service was excellent. Thank you, the steak sandwiches were delicious!

I have to say, I understand the time that we are in but I am not fan of this outdoor dinning. The tables are right in the sidewalk people are walking right pass you looking at you, I was not fan of it. Beside that the food was good they have special menu they don't have there full menu just so you know. The staff was great and super nice.

I have stopped eating here for lunch because I feel that they are too busy during lunch and the quality of the food suffers as a result. I recently went for restaurant week and I ordered a medium rare burger. The burger came well done. I didn't send it back, because everyone else got their food and I didn't want to wait for the time it would take another burger to be cooked.
On the other hand, their dinner is nice and good quality cuts on the steaks. I would recommend coming here for dinner rather than lunch.

The Capital Grille - Wall Street is known for their gigantic wine cellar vault dining room. My boyfriend and I visited here for our first time for Restaurant Week Lunch. We both chose the creamy Clam Chowder as a starter. The Clam Chowderwas filled with an abundance of clams. The Grille's Signature Cheeseburger was cooked perfectly medium rare, but the Truffle Fries were the BEST!!! My Tenderloin Salad was looking a bit sad on the big plate. I wanted to try their filet mignon with my salad, but was told that it was NOT an add-on. I would have to pay an additional $10 to REPLACE my Tenderloin with filet mignon, and same for the bone in dry aged NY strip. I did not choose that option. I'm not used to eating dry-aged steak and would have preferred my steak juicer. The steak tasted very dry like in beef stew. The arugula salad had some cherry tomatoes, wished it would tasted more flavorful. Overall, not incredible steak and bit pricey. You can definitely get better steak elsewhere for a better price, ambiance, and service, in NYC.

Had my Valentine's Day dinner here and it was great. The service, food and vibes are all 10/10. I used to always get the seared tenderloin with butter poached lobster tail (amazing) but I've recently been getting the filet mignon with the porcini rub and it's next level. SO GOOD. Sides also always great. I like the potatoes au gratin and the Brussels sprouts. I go here a lot with my boyfriend and it never gets old!

Update to 5 stars. Kept thinking about my poor steak all day and couldnt wait until the restaurant opened at 5pm. Spoke with the manager Jeffery Horn and he saved the day!

Again, I would suggest packing your own food or at least check you bags before leaving otherwise like I said before service, decor, food exceptional!!

Three stars for me : Do not let the ""bus boys"" pack your food!!

Found out this morning one of my leftover entrees went missing. Never in my life have I had someone take my food after a courtesy ""pack up"". This gentlemen had at least a 5 min conversation at my table telling us how he would pack the food - two steaks together and sides in separate boxes. He knew everything on the table needed to be packed togo. This was no accident. Unacceptable.

Really dont even want to write the rest of this review but anyway... the restaurant itself is beautiful!  Definitely a great place for birthdays, anniversaries, date night...very cozy and romantic.

Our actual server, Thalia Alonzo, was exceptional. Very attentive and personable. Food was excellent from the wedge salad with bacon/bleu cheese to NY Strip/Filet Mignon (melt in your mouth so tender). Also, opted for the mashed potatoes which were o so creamy and delicious! I was super full after the entree probably because I consumed too much bread before lol but there is always room for dessert, right? haha.  I didnt think I was going to enjoy the creme brulee but wow I couldnt resist! I had a great experience at this restaurant and was raving about it until I just found out somebody stole one of my to go meals. Smh. Im still in shock. If it wasnt for this I would have rated this restaurant 5 stars.

The Capital Grille is a chain of high-end business restaurants that you will find in many major US cities. Always reliable and always consistent. Good steaks and seafood starters. The wine list is also excellent. Service is efficient. The price is high, but not outrageous. The food is good but more clubby than creative.

Classy Location and setting inside and out. Located in NY's Financial district.
Sam orchestrated a very nice meal. Started with rounds of freshly prepared drinks, table bread and crackers; and some lightly breaded, nicely seasoned fried calamari. Second round....more drinks and some starters - most had the lobster bisque and I had the wedge salad - fresh chunk of iceberg lettuce topped with candied bacon and cherry tomatoes, with just the right amount of dressing.
Next the Flintstones would be proud of a 22oz Bone-In Ribeye prepared with delicate Porcini mushroom crust, topped with a 15-year aged Balsamic sauce, perfect medium rare. The table sides of: Lightly grilled asparagus drizzled with lemon; Soy Glazed Brussels Sprouts with smoked bacon; Au Gratin Potatoes, hearty slices layered with a blend of cheeses and Lobster Mac N Cheese.  All served hot and fresh. We finished with various deserts and coffee. Top quality experience. Not impressed with my photo quality, so no pics this time. I will be back.

I made a reservation for around 8 PM on a Friday. Even though I arrived a bit late, I was still seated promptly.

Ordered the filet mignon and the seared scallops. The seared scallops were absolutely delicious and possibly one of the best dishes I've ever had. The pur√©e used in the ecallops mixed exquisitiely with the asparagus and mushrooms that were also there to ornate the dish. A must try.

This place is a delight. My boyfriend and I made reservations to celebrate our 3 year anniversary and we had a wonderful time. Everything from the moment we entered, to our waiter, to the food, was great! Our table was retired from everyone else, which was perfect because we had a corner all to ourselves in the second floor, making the night extra special.

The server was VERY knowledgeable and attentive and even offered us a complementary appetizer, which was delicious by the way. We loved him! he seemed very happy to answer all our questions and didn't hesitate to make suggestions throughout our visit.

When it comes to the food, I won't say it was the best steak I've ever had, BUT not disappointing at all and totally worth the price. Huge portion by the way.

I must say the wine was my favorite part! They had an amazing selection and our choice went perfectly with our dinner.

All in all, I definitely recommend this spot! We will definitely be revisiting

This was my boyfriend's chosen eatery for Valentine's Day. We were seated fairly quickly although we arrived an hour after our reservation.

The restaurant is large. We were seated downstairs and we had two servers, whom were both very attentive and friendly. The drinks were displayed on tablets which was very cool. I ordered the French 75 (which I didn't like) and my boyfriend ordered the bourbon drink (he enjoyed it).

For dinner, I ordered the roasted chicken (1/2 chicken) without the Mediterranean olives. My boyfriend ordered the steak. We both felt our entrees tasted okay. As sides, we ordered the lobster Mac and cheese and creamed spinach. I lovee the lobster Mac and cheese. That was the highlight of my dinner!!! Plus, if you see my boyfriend eating mac and cheese then it must be really good cus he doesn't even like Mac and cheese and he really enjoyed it.

The ambience is lovely and the service from the staff is excellent. I would definitely return for that delicious Mac and cheese lol.

My first time was a great experience. The food was delicious. I would definitely recommend for a date night. I loved the lamb chops. I believe the bill was about $150 for two people with two entrees, one shareable side, and two drinks.

Always nice to come in here as its classy and great quality.
Great service and everyone was happy with their choices..

Here for the a dinner, lobster and crab cake was good but sauce on top was way too salty.  Normally their salad was ok but tonight their salad was extremely salty.

The waitress who took our orders was nice but bus boy was kinda rude.  He seems to be harshed and kept banking my head a couple time.  The part that I was waiting for this dinner was dessert but I was disappointed cause they forgot mine.  One I mentioned it the waitress was like ""OMG I totally forgot and what did you order again""  I also asked for tea, by the time she served me tea was just warm.  Really disappointed this time.  I wont go back to this location again.

Sitting at the bar. It's not overly busy. We weren't offered bread we ordered a bourbon and a beer and two iced teas an appetizer and salads waiting on our entree our dirty dishes sat for about  15 min. We about to drop about 200 dollars bartenders consist of one male and a female who is kinda bitchy. Never offered bread but other people were.   Sad very sad. Steak wasn't prepared improperly. Oh well I'll go back to Houston for a steak. As a frequent traveler it's very sad.  Would not come back as New York-has a lot of options. Sad when your potatoes are better than your steak. Giving two stars cause the salad and potatoes were the best part.

Wow, I haven't had a steak dinner like this since I was in Chicago.  This Capital Grille Wall Street location has a dining area right inside of an old  bank vault.

The Creme Brulee was delectable.

The quality of food and service was second to none.  I look forward to going back.

I have been here a ton.  I only come for business and only lunch.  It is across the street from my office.  The service is excellent.  The wine choices by the glass are ok.  I always get the same thing.  The French onion soup is fantastic. The sushi tuna is outstanding.  The flourless chocolate cake is very good.

It is not cheap, but it is also not one one the super expensive restaurants.  All my guests have always enjoyed their meals, most get a steak.

Capital grille is within my work building at 120 Broadway. What I love about my building itself is the ceiling which was featured in Wolf of Wall Street!

As soon as you enter capital grille you hear the numerous business conversations as you pass by to find a seat at the bar. If you choose to sit by the bar, the service is great. The bartenders are friendly and are accommodating to how you would like your drink.

You'll always here one business man call them by them name and say ""the usual"".

I cane here with my boss  for business right before the our holiday party. He knew the waiter by his name, Brian. He was extremely Accommodating in providing me with a vegetarian pasta option. The pasta was delicious and the portion was amazing. For drinks I had 3 rounds of stoli doli! What I LOVE about capital grill is that their drinks are STRONG. Now there have been times where it is a bit overwhelming so I recommend giving this feedback to your waiter as they are extremely accommodating and nice to adjust your drink preference.

I have great memories at this Capital Grill in particular as it is where my company and I spent out boss's last day. My boss was nice enough to get an gorgeous room in which sat over 10 people. We were able to shut the doors of the room to silence the business chit chats of the main floor. We were told the chefs special which sounded drool worthy but we stuck to appetizers and drinks.
The service was great, the food was delicious and the drinks were able to keep me calm for the awkward conversations that were occasionally Carried out throughout the night

This place is expensive but what do you expect? You're on Wall Street baby

This is a great neighborhood bar that's often pretty busy during happy hour.

They've got a little outdoor area in front, with a cozy and spacious bar on the inside. It expands all the way to the back which has more private little tables.

Drinks are decently priced and their bar is well stocked. They've also got some bites on their menu if you need a light meal or a snack.

Check this place out if you're around!

Was exploring Brooklyn with a friend and they recommended this place from a resent visit during the holiday pop up. It was a Sunday night, so very chill. We sat at a table, no menus on the table and no acknowledgement or instruction from the staff (hence the stars). Luckily, seats opened at the bar and we moved. Once there the girl bartender was friendly and pleasant and the drinks we ordered were SUPER delicious (cranberry club and non alcoholic spiced hot chocolate). I'd go again, but as a customer definitely felt a bit unimportant initially.

We were visiting Brooklyn from California and we were testing out a bunch of bars.  But this one was a real good find! The Bartender was awesome, very friendly and he had made a drink of the night.

""Hearing aid"" couldn't tell you what was in it, but it was delicious and had so many fancy mixing and things to it. Burned a cinnamon stick which I really
Liked!
Also I ordered a pina colada which was super yummy! Not too sweet at all.

How did I get so lucky to have a bar like Livingston Manor so close to my apartment?! It has proven to be a solid bar choice with every single half a dozen times that I've been here. Bartenders are super friendly and quick with the cocktails, which are always strong and leave me without complaints. The beer selection is plentiful and offers a decent variety.

Sure, the bathrooms are a tad on the gross side and the smokers completely take over the small outdoor space, but neither of those things is enough to keep me away. I would describe the overall ambiance as fancy divey - dark, fairly large, yet somehow still cozy. I am all about their skylight - unique feature for a bar of this caliber.

More times than not, I stay out way too late when I hit the Manor, but it's hard not to with their great music that always keeps me humming along and makes me forget that they stay open until 4am most nights. I still have not gotten around to trying any of the food, but I'm sure that is just around the corner in the near future.

Joe and Lindsey are fantastic bartenders!

We went late late late for a nightcap a couple weeks ago, just three of us ladies. We grabbed a beer and chilled for a while. Really nice atmosphere, and a gem in Downtown Brooklyn.

While we were there, a man started hitting on my friend. It was unwanted and aggressive. (I won't go into detail). In seconds, both Joe and Lindsey were swatting the man away, and the bouncers were dragging him out the door. SEE YA.

Then we continued our egregious amounts of drinking, took some shots with our two heroes and headed home around 3am.

A delightful evening.

5 Stars for a cocktail bar that would be on my regular, multiple-times-a-week rotation if I lived nearby.

Walking in, I heard Mac Miller playing in the background and a great crowd enjoying what appeared to be finely crafted cocktails (not a margarita mix in sight) and I knew Yelp had led us in the right direction once again.

The bartender, a casually dressed dude with a beard,  greeted us at the bar and asked what we had in mind. They had a nice little cocktail menu, but I was unsure and let him know I was leaning towards something whiskey-based, that wasn't sweet, and wasn't your typical old fashioned. He quickly suggested something he'd been making which was similar to an old fashioned but with a sick kick from ancho chili syrup.

This drink, along with a tequila and sherry drink my companion ordered, was right on the mark. It wasn't too sweet (which for me, is a low barrier), and the bite hit you at the end in a subtle fashion towards the back of the throat. My friend's drink left a taste of sherry in your mouth that was delightful and helped me forget about the tequila (bad past with tequila).

Beyond that, the ambiance and music went from great, to epic. With Mystical playing as we were leaving, making me reminisce HARD about those nights out at the club in college. Ahhh, the early 2000s... May we never forget...

The highlight of the bar though was the bartender. I didn't catch his name, but this dude would have me coming back night after night. And the tunes.

Stopped into Livingston Manor for happy hour on Friday. Decent food, decent drinks, decent prices, but nothing that left me with the urge to head back.

Quality: Livingston Manor is a pretty standard bar. Falling somewhere between cocktail and dive, it serves up drinks and a limited food menu. I went with a few beers from the happy hour selection. Nothing crazy, but a few local options and okay variety. I also shared a Meat & Cheese Board. They leave the compilation of your three selections up to you. We went one cured meat, one soft cheese, and one hard cheese. The options constantly change, which adds some variety. What came on our board was good, though I think they could have made it look a bit prettier.
Quantity: A fair sized Meat & Cheese Board and solid beer pours.
Value: $26 for a Meat & Cheese Board. $2 off Draft Beers during happy hour, leaving most options between $4 and $6.
Ambiance: Livingston Manor is found along an alley in Downtown Brooklyn. They have a tiny patio outside, which was occupied by smokers our entire visit, and then a decent sized indoor area. The bar sits on the left wall, while high tops spread around the front space. The back area of the bar is a bit more cozy and private. A mix of brick, concrete, and wood, industrial accents, and a classic rock playlist should all be expected. Unfortunately, nothing that really stands out.
Crowd: A good sized crowd for happy hour. Always a few seats available, but busy enough and a fun group.
Service: Quick and helpful service. Appreciated the bartender who went out of his way to get us drinks even after we moved to a table.
Parking: No easy parking in the area.

I was so focused with catching up with a college friend who I haven't seen in years & forgot to take any pics. I'll just say this about the bar. It's near Barclays & Alamo movie theatre. I came here during their happy hour & it was lovely. Service was great & the waiters made you feel special like it was your birthday if you know what I mean haha. For those who didn't get that reference, it means that the drinks were tasty & strong. It felt like a hidden gem because it wasn't flashy at all, just a dive in bar that you would expect in some dark alley with a few tables & a bar table. No TVs in sight whatsoever which was a refreshing touch because you don't see much of those anymore especially since millennials are all for visual experiences. Bottom line is I enjoyed myself & I will come back for sure

The drinks are generally good.  I appreciate a well made cocktail, I wish they had more food options.  They have a great bourbon hot toddy in the winter.  My big complaint is that they once charged my credit card twice for the same transaction.  The bar tender didn't even apologize.  Don't play with my money.

My friends and I found this gem while figuring out what to do on an unseasonably warm fall night. We came across this place and fell in love right way. It is dimly lit, and tastefully decorated. My friends really enjoyed their drinks, and we shared an amazing cheese & meat plate. There bar menu was small but filled with some really great selections. This place was really enjoyable and I highly recommend it.

Great place to hang out with co workers or bring a date to. This place is a very cozy casual spot to hang and grab a drink. I personally never got food from here so I can't speak for the food. Wolf the bartender is the man and always on top of his game.

This is a very cool bar.
They have great appetizers, cocktails, draught beers and wines.  This is a nice size with plenty of seating and even a little outdoor space.  Bartenders and servers are always very cool and attentive.
Good place to meet with friends.  Can get pretty crowded in the evenings.

I just keep coming back here.
Appetizers are delicious and I've been ordering their specialty cocktails instead of classic cocktails (i.e. Old fashioned) and they're really delicious! Really interesting and well balanced and strong-I suggest you order off their menu and get a favored classic.
This place is so chill.

Ok had to update review.
Usually I reserve 5 stars for ""fancy"" places  that wait hand and foot but this place is awesome.
Classy meets chill here.
Bartenders are friendly, low key and attentive.
Cocktails are a little weaker than I like but they have tons of top shelf whiskeys and the happy hour (2 pints for ten or something like that) is awesome.
Had some cheese and ""small bites"" here and everything was delicious-so much attention to detail.
All in all, fantastic experience and a real treasure. I look forward to becoming a regular.

Came here on a Friday night to meet up with some coworkers and had a horrible experience. Don't come here hungry as their food menu is skimp with just meat and cheese platters. No options for people with dietary restrictions. Not even French fries!

The waitress who was working our table was extremely rude and condescending after screwing up our requests. It was horrible. First she ""didn't hear me"" order a garden salad. Then it took forever to arrive at our table. THEN my glass of wine had a miscellaneous substance in it and she seemed annoyed with us for reporting it to her. She brought back a new glass with the only attitude. It was also very clear from where I was sitting that she was talking crap about me to her colleague at the bar. I'm not sure if she was treating me this way because I'm a person of color or if she was just ticked off that night. Either way I won't be returning here again.

This was a great spot for happy hour! So many of their beers and wines were discounted which made it a great deal. It was perfect for a friend and I hanging out, but is also great for groups. There is a cute outdoor space which makes it perfect for the spring and summer months when it is nice out. Because this place is in Brooklyn, it has much more space than similar bars in Manhattan
Would definitely go back and try some cocktails but stuck to happy hour deals this time!

I prefer the vibe here on the weekends. Great place to start or end your night. Joe is pouring and controlling the music. No complaints about either, ever. I've only gotten here in time for the only late night food option, the grilled cheese, and it's yummy. Tomato, bacon and mixed cheeses pressed on quality bread with a bag of Cape Cod chips for $9. It's a nicely kept spot also. Come through!

There happens to be a staggering number of figures in early American history named Robert Livingston, all of whom are bound by knots in the blood. The town for which this bar is named, as well as the street just beyond, are both named for Roberts Livingston, who were cousins and contemporaries, yet not the same person. One ruled over an anachronistically feudal estate in the Catskills; the other was the master mason who swore in George Washington as the first president, a singular act marking the beginning of centuries of uniquely American paranoia.

The Livingston bloodline tangles into those represented by many other New York streets: Bleecker, Cortlandt, Clinton, Van Ness, and so on and so forth, concrete threads of conspiracy. Outlandish legends readily spread of a population of escaped crocodiles making their home beneath them, as well as of lizard-like beings secretly controlling American politics while wearing human skin. Such stories seem absurd until we remember that the reptilian cortex underlies all of our higher brain functions; that every supposedly rational belief of man is built atop the thrashings of a terrified, skull-shelled tortoise.

That being said, the Illuminati are real. You can often find them on commuter planes between LaGuardia and Logan, as well as throughout the Under East Side, holed up in bars run by the troglodytes of antiquity. These establishments are torchlit and densely-packed, accommodations intended to compensate for their ectothermal nature. There they decide on the taxes in blood that each earthly nation shall pay while devouring handfuls of tempura-battered cigarettes like popcorn.

Fortunately, this is not an Illuminati bar. There are no exchanges of mermaid fingernails for drinks, no ice blocks congealed from the tears of endangered species. This is a place for the warm-blooded.

Weaving spiders come not here.

This spot is a breath of fresh air in a part of town that isn't really know for good bars. We were meeting some friends before a movie at Alamo, and needed a place to unwind before we went in. We could have, of course, gone to house of wax (which is an OK bar in its own right, and is located inside Alamo), but wanted something different that night. They suggested Livingston and we agreed. Happy we did, as we found a new spot that we will be sure to return to.

Walking up, its hard to miss how dramatically the neighborhood is changing. Huge new residential buildings are really taking over, and its starting to feel a lot more like downtown Manhattan than ever before. Leaving aside if this is a good thing or not, it really is interesting to see how Livingston fits in. The space doesn't feel new (like its neighbors), but it also doesn't feel out of place. Its cool that a place like this can fit in so well in a space that is so fluid. The bar dominates the interior (as you might expect...at a bar), but there are plenty of tables and booths to be had (not a bad choice for a larger group). The staff was friendly enough, and their HH beer prices are not bad at all for what might be considered a pricey neighborhood. I didn't try a cocktail, but the one's I saw being made looked pretty solid. The bar was pretty full on the Friday we went, but considering the options of the neighborhood, that wasn't really surprising. That said, if you're coming with more than four, I'd make an effort to get here early for one of the larger tables. If you're really lucky, you can grab one of the small tables outside (and if you sit long enough, a new building might spring up in front of you...)

All in all, this place is a solid call; I've no doubt this will be my new go to if I'm in the area.

I have found my new favorite bar! I would live in this place if I was a resident of downtown Brooklyn. We were bar hopping since we only had one night in the area, but loved this place and my drink so much that we came back for our night cap. When we returned there were 4 bar tenders instead of the three earlier.

The vibe coming from this place is fantastic. It seems inconspicuously tucked away, because it has a great little porch before the entrance. The front wall is a large door and huge windows with seating on both sides. When you enter you will see there are multiple options for seating with five high tables and a concrete bar that stretches the length of the space. In the back is more seating and another small outdoor space. The lighting is uniquely industrial. I drooled over the large circular antique mirrors that balance the wall behind the bar. They play a mix of music that I appreciated. The bar tenders were very friendly, had great smiles, and fast for creative cocktail place. They were good at multitasking as would make a drink and take your order at the same time.

They had an impressive cocktail, beer, wine and food list.  The prices are normal for a nice cocktail bar. I sipped on, well tried to sip on, the Corner stone. It was a red currant infused vodka with cognac, fresh lemon, cherry jam, topped with Prosecco. I am a sucker for a cocktail topped with Prosecco. My hubby enjoyed the local gin with tonic. Since we were only staying for one round and nibble we opted for the deviled eggs. They were scrumptious. We liked addition of frishee greens, pickled fennel (?) and green sauce. We saw another table get the veggie sandwich which we were eyeing on the menu and it looked delicious as well. The people  who got it didn't leave a crumb on their plate so I think I can assume they enjoyed it.

Good beers, good cocktails, a tiny backyard space, and a tiny frontyard sidewalk space. Big interior though. And cool bartenders and waitresses.

I've also run into multiple people that I've known from high school and college here. Small world, but I guess this is where lawyers and law school kids like to hang out.

This is a charming little spot in Downtown Brooklyn that's easy to miss (small 'Manor' sign that can get lost in the shuffle between avenues). I've only been a couple of times, but the staff has always been friendly, the music's never been too loud, and it's always had an overall great ambiance for a lowkey hang.

This was the first cocktail bar I went to when I moved to Brooklyn nearly two years ago, and it remains a favorite.  The cocktail menu changes seemingly as frequently as the beer list--always something new to try.  Last time, I went with one of my usual no-syrup/no-juice (i.e., all booze) selections and followed it up with a fun tiki-style drink.  Both great.  They also nail the classics every time I've requested one.

The charcuterie is reasonably priced and well-portioned for sharing a snack or for one person's dinner.  Atmosphere feels sophisticated without being stuffy or contrived.  Usually bustling without being overcrowded--can always find a seat or two at the bar.

Love it.

Downtown Brooklyn has definitely changed. I lived in BK x over 20yrs.  Recently went to visit a friend living in the newly re-established buildings now converted into condos. He suggested to go for a drink nearby, I thought maybe head over to Court street area. Surprised I was to be on Livingston St.

I certainly knew I wasn't in Kansas anymore. Anyway, I won't turn this post into the gentrification of Fulton St.

We got there a bit around midnight (Thursday?). Not packed but there were several people still there getting their drank on.
Seats were available by the bar. Waitress was friendly enough.
Atmosphere is ""dark"". We stayed for 2 drinks each, chatted with some other friendly patrons.

It's still a distance from where I live but I would like to try the Happy Hr. Glad to see the space around there is drumming up some life to it.

In the depths of the downtown Brooklyn area it can be hard to find a good place to get a drink. Luckily Livingston Manor now exists.

Came here for happy hour and was pleasantly surprised. An excellent array of beers, cocktails, and wine. All at an excellent price. Playing some good tunes, sippin on some whiskey, and hanging out with my girl, I couldn't be happier.

Happy Hour does get a little crowded so make sure you come a little earlier to find your nook. I still would like to come by and check it out at night, I've heard great things. Maybe you should too.

I never post on Yelp but had to this time. Livingston hosted our welcome drinks the night before our wedding. They were really flexible in customizing the offerings for our group to meet our budget and vibe. It was a really fun, relaxing night and the service was amazing. Guests had a fun time and loved their drinks. Thanks for helping kick off our wedding weekend!

Good, solid bar. I just wandered in here the other day, and the staff was super welcoming and cheerful. I went during happy hour on a Thursday and there was a lot of available seating. I'd recommend sitting in the back because the bar is rather dark, but there's a huge skylight in the back.

Would go again!

I came in here last night after running a few errands...ducked in here to avoid the rain and so glad I did. Upon entering you notice the rustic and inviting feeling immediately. I sat at the bar and ordered a glass of wine, which was priced fairly for the quantity served. They have a wide selection of Beer on tap, which I will try next time. Their Menu offers suitable items for everyone and appetizing enough that you may be inclined to want to try different things. The bartender was super cool and courteous! Can't wait to go back!

The owners and talent behind Franklin Park and Crown Inn in Crown Heights are behind Livingston Manor, a new bar in downtown Brooklyn. Located between Hoyt (2,3) train station and Hoyt (A,C) train station Livingston Manor  brings a much needed watering hole to the area.

Being very familiar with both Franklin Park and Crown Inn I had high expectations for this bar, and opening night didn't disappoint.

The bar is beautiful and spacious. There is ample seating throughout and a cool skylight in the back.For people who smoke or like drinking outside, there is small area out back and a front porch where you can indulge.

The beer selection covers just about everything ( they have 12 taps) including several from Catskills brewery.

I spent my time enjoying the cocktails which are fantastic. The standout was The Bugsville Fizz, a $13 variation on ramos gin fizz, but with bourbon instead of gin. An egg white based cocktail, so delicious  it was hard to sip slow. The Dominicana, a $12 rum and coffee liqueur based cocktail is also excellent, Both were pleasantly sweet but not excessively so. If you prefer a spicier cocktail try the Blinking Light ($12) a mezcal based cocktail with chili salted rim.

With all that said what makes me return to a bar is the staff. Being  familiar with a few already and liking who I met last night, I can see this becoming yet another bar for me to hangout in regularly.

PS-  they do have food, but arrived too late to try any.

Very nice bar for an after-work drink. They have an interesting selection of beers on tap and a nice happy hour on those.
I prefer to go there in the colder moths for some reason--it's dark and cozy. In the Summer, they have a front patio available.
It is usually very loud (there are always big groups there!) and the bartenders can be a little rough over there... depends on a day!

A speakeasy-like bar in the middle of an underdeveloped Downtown Brooklyn street! So glad I discovered this spot.

It's sandwiched between some beat down buildings and maybe a grocery store, but once you step in, it's like you're in another world. I absolutely LOVE the smell in here...you know the cocktails will not disappoint.

They must change the cocktail menu quite frequently so unless you are willing to gamble, I recommend asking the bartender as the Yelp pics from a few months ago might be old news.

The jamon y queso sandwich is soooooo good and flavorful. I didn't really enjoy the meatballs, but highly recommend the sandwich.

This spot is a must try!

Before COVID19: We were in NY visiting the city for the Christmas holiday and staying in Brooklyn one evening.  Gran Electrica was a fun vibe and great place to grab drinks.

Came here during COVID and was seated in the outdoor area. The outdoor seating is gorgeous and very ambient. Wait staff was very attentive and came around frequently to see how we were doing. The cucumber margarita was amazing and super refreshing. My partner and I shared the fish and carnitas tacos and it was TRULY spectacular!! I will be coming here again shortly! Just put an order in for the Churros which look amazing too! Come here!

My lover and I often frequent this establishment after seeing a show at St. Ann's Warehouse. Meaning, we come here when we are in need of intravenous margaritas. That's bc St. Ann's often produces over-hyped trifles directed by the latest Euro-auteur who is basically just recycling some design method that was cool in downtown theater in the 70s. Anyways. We come here and get the margaritas and fish tacos because they are amazing and deep fried in some perfect batter which has some surprising ingredient in it that I can't remember. The margaritas taste non-alcoholic, but trust me. They are. That's because they too have a secret ingredient in them and that secret ingredient is Combier. Bless the gentleman that answered the phone during the pandemic and shared with me the secret to Gran Electrica's margaritas bc they are seriously what has gotten me through the pandemic whilst separated from my best friend, my lover.

I feel like I only go here when I'm in DUMBO because there's nowhere else to go.
Lovely atmosphere but so far the only thing I've had that I like is the queso fundido, which is really good.
Barbacoa tacos weren't very good: they were fatty and I couldn't finish them even though I was super hungry.
Went with a friend around 9pm on a Friday night and we were able to get the last high too table for two.
I've always had a good time here even if the food isn't amazing.

This is a great place for last minute plans because they accept walk-ins! Their chicken tacos were amazing and their salsa and guac is so worth a try! Would definitely go back for the ambience and the food
Ask for their signature cocktails when you're there.

The food and drinks were really good. I had the  carnitas tacos w/ rice and sangria. I particularly loved the backyard area. It was very spacious so nobody was sitting on top of each other. The staff was very nice and wearing masks, which made me feel safe. I would definitely come back here and it's super cute

Probably, the worst tacos I've ever had. I ordered pork tacos and my friend got shrimp or fish tacos, I couldn't tell  We were both trying to figure what was inside.
Pieces of pork were so hard it was almost impossible to chew, and absolutely tasteless. How can one screw tacos so bad?.. they're super easy to make, I cook better ones at home. Guacamole was okay though. Also, I was a bit surprised by the prices. My to-go order came up to $30, plus tip. I had pork tacos and a glass of ros√® wine. If tacos were $13, the wine obviously made up for the rest. Rooftop prices for alcohol without the rooftop? No, thank you. I'll pass next time

Gran Electrica reigns supreme as both a dinner or brunch spot in the summer months. I've been here before for dinner and had a great experience, so when friends recommended this spot for brunch on a sunny Sunday, I was in.

Garden seating is where it's at. I had only ever dined there at night but it's equally as beautiful in the day.

The drinks were spot on. I went with the Pepito which was extremely refreshing. My friends tried the Paloma and the Sangria which they raved about as well.

I will say that the portions are pretty small for the price, but the ambiance really makes it worth the splurge.

Gran Electrica is date night ELEVATED.

Do the smart thing and make reservations if possible, or else you will wait about 45 minutes or more for a table in the outdoor dining space. Whether you have a wait or not, just know the outdoor space is entirely worth it. Perfectly lit, vibrant, and fun (with awesome music playing in the background, naturally). It is the perfect little escape from Brooklyn and would make an amazing venue for a private party.

We ordered a few plates to split which was a good choice. Here's what we went with:

The ceviche - orange, avocado, jicama, red onion, cilantro, and pickled jalape√±o. The perfect summer dish ($ = MP)

The carnitas tacos (2 per order) - pork, cilantro, and a really good salsa ($11)

The carne tacos (2 per order) - with beef and that dope salsa again ($10)

I will admit that the prices here are a little steep, but keep in mind that you are not only paying for the food, but for the ambiance and experience. Service was really quick and friendly enough. I'd definitely be interested in trying out their brunch too.

This was a disappointing experience. It wasn't awful, but there were some pretty glaring flaws that put a damper on our brunch. Booked a reservation for 8 well in advance for a big group to sit in the fabulous outdoor space in the back. Beautiful ivy on the wall and view of the underside of the Brooklyn Bridge, it had the ambiance check. HOWEVER, we were sat on the far left side of the space near a fence that must have had mountains of trash on the other side due to the amount of flies and occasional gross smells wafting by us during the meal.

As for the food, it was pretty solid but not amazing. Portions varied depending on the dish, but most were good. The quesadilla would be one thing I'd say not get (too small), while the chilaquiles and chorizo would be highlights. HOWEVER, it took over an hour for the food to arrive even though we had the first restoration of the day. They clearly were having kitchen issues because they brought out some free guacamole, which was nice. Still, they even once came and said the food was being plated, which was clearly a lie because it still didnt come for another 30 minutes.

All in all, we had a good time cuz the weather was nice and good company, but I wouldn't bring guests here again after the experience. Writing this out makes my 3 star review feel a little generous to be honest...

This review is specifically for the bar.
After walking the Brooklyn Bridge at night, a friend and I were looking for a little place to sit, have a drink, and maybe munch on something.  We had heard that this place had great churros, and we could get a drink too, so we thought we'd try it.

First of all, the churros were NOT what we expected.  See my picture if you're interested in what we got.  I don't know what we were expecting... but it wasn't this.  They seemed like they had been packaged.

Anyways, the churros aside, the drinks and bartender were great.  We enjoyed just sitting and taking in the atmosphere.  I really did like the decor and our bartender was attentive, but not too attentive.  It didn't seem like this was too touristy. The feel was local, but it could have just been the evening.

I would probably come back, but I wouldn't order the churros.

Came here with a friend to get drinks and catch up. Dumbo has become pretty touristy but this place keeps it cool. When we got there around 5:30 pm it wasn't that busy and we stayed for a looong time. Sitting at the bar, the bartender never rushed us to leave and even as it got really busy they stayed attentive to us. The drinks are also reasonably priced. We ordered all the margaritas, the cucumber (pepino) margarita was my favorite. The grapefruit marg was only a bit spicy, with I nice grapefruit flavor.

We ordered the sangria tostada, I thought it was awful. Not the bartender's fault because they make it in batches before the day. Neither of us liked it and a couple girls next to us also ordered it an complained of the taste. This sangria has a very strong flavor of mezcal (smoky) but with the fruitiness it's just not a great combo. I ended up returning it and getting another margarita.

Sometimes the best places are the one you find at the last minute. This time the choice was mine to make and although I've frequent other spots in the area, I wanted to try something different. As it has done many times before, YELP saved me. Gran Electrica won the day.

Gran Electrica seems to be quite popular and so I would highly recommend that you make a reservation. It's a small place but absolutely charming. This night I was dining with a friend and so I guess reserving a table was easy. Although they have seating on the inside, we opted to eat out on their patio. I'm glad we did. It doesn't have much of view but the ambiance it provides is cute.

The staff was excellent. I didn't catch the brothers name that served us but he was definitely on point and our tip reflected that. As for the food, I wish they would add another taco. Most places give you at least three. The two fish tacos were superb but two left us wanting more. The salsa and guacamole and margaritas were equally delish. So, if your in the area, make a reservation and enjoy.

I came here with some work friends and had a great time. Great ambience. Good drinks. Food was decent. We got the Carnitas taco and short rib taco. I felt like the portion was small for the price. The carnitas was two tacos, each about the size of my palm. The short rib was just 1 piece. They both tasted amazing just wish there was more. We got churros for dessert, that was the best pick. Service was great.

Came at a friend's recommendation but I was pretty disappointed. The ambiance is great with the Mexicana decor. But the food and drinks were a-ok at best and priced high. Do it for the chic but not for the taste.

We ordered:
- 1/2 carafe Sangria $23
- Margarita Electrica $14
- Yucca Frita $8

So I was super excited for this meal, and I felt like a boss just walking in with my reservation (glad I made one, it was packed). The outdoor seating area is gorgeous and I recommend going at night when all the string lights are on.

I had the sangria, which was not what I was expecting. The waitstaff said it would be smokier than I was used to, and I guess it was, but it didn't come with any fruit or really taste like sangria. It was strong though, so ultimately it did the job.

We ordered the yucca frita, which I'm pretty sure was undercooked because it was still kind of starchy, but the ceviche was super smooth and quite delicious. Noah got the Chili Relleno, which he admitted was good, but nothing special.

All in all I'm glad we tried Gran Electrica, but based on the hip website, the need for a reservation and the price point, I was expecting it to be much better than it was.

The vibe is out of the worldly. I recommend you sit in the back open area. The lighting, the dj, the drinks made for such a nice dinner.

P.S. everyone try their michaladas.

New York. Tacos? Brooklyn. Tequila? Dumbo. Mescal? I'm in love with Brooklyn already. Forget the City. Well, you don't have to because cross the bridge and you are in the heart of it anyway.

All I know is that this night was about meeting one of my besties from DC who resides in the area now and we were staying within walking distance of Mexican food. Our hotel recommended Gran Electrica. It's small, intimate and has a fun decor. Similar to our ethnic haunts of restaurants and bars in the District and Virginia (where we spent time during our 20's and 30's). We had electric soul then and we have no reason to give it up now!

Both of us married and husbands in tow, tonight was about great company and good food. The word Gran fits more with our age now, but thank goodness you can sit in a room and have a conversation at an appropriate noise level. My meal consisted of a Agave cocktail (wait for the punch line) with a sugar rim that was superb. Of, course I got the tacos and a side of rice. Forget the signs outside (on this night, although they will make you laugh), the tacos won and no need for tequila as the only people we were texting this night were in our own group.

My friend and I have dined at George Bush's (senior) favorite restaurant in Falls Church, VA, so intrigued our friends purchased us ALL the Bok Choy plants in the restaurant to decorate my new place at the time (and struggled to get them home safely), we attended Shaquille O'Neill 21'st birthday party at Lulu's in DC (before anyone really knew who he was) and these are the tame experiences of our existence. We had MANY coincidences, more than any two people probably could have, which no longer make things a coincidence. Perhaps, it was just meant to be. I love my homegirl and Brooklyn. Our husbands area pretty amazing too.

Another reason to eat at Gran Electric. Napa! We will have to visit the NorCal location on our tour of Jam Cellars and BottleRock.
Gran El√©ctrica create cocktails that give back to charities, such as Black Lives Matter, Red Nose Day, The UN Refugee Agency, etc.
Prior to our trip, the son and daughter in-law recently discovered a bat in their home in New England and had to bring in an exterminator.
Gran El√©ctrica has a line of ""bat friendly"" agave spirits (I sure hope that's the one I tried). Apparently, there would be no agave without bats. So the punch line is...when life gives you bats, it's time to make agave! Cheers to the perfect Halloween to be treat!

It was a rainy Sunday, my plans were stymied, so I knew only tacos could save the day. Gran Electrica not only provided delicious food but great music.

It's dimly lit, so this place makes a great date night spot. I really like the design of the restaurant; it's intimate, romantic, and carefully curated. I came with 2 other friends, and we were seated rather quickly. I ordered the fish and pork tacos, the plantains, and the churros.

The fish tacos were my favorite thing, I had to order another one! It was perfectly fried, and the flavors surrounding it were perfect. I enjoyed the pork tacos, but they didn't give me as much joy as the fish ones. I loved that the plantains were covered in cheese, and they were perfectly ripe. I loved the churros; they gave chocolate and caramel sauce, and the caramel sauce was my favorite. I will definitely be back again to try the guacamole and the short rib entree.

I walked in with a friend and asked the hostess if they had happy hour, she said yes then proceeded to seat us at a table, then our server came and told us happy hour was only at the bar, so we had to sit by the door because the bar was full.

Once we finally got the bartenders attention the margarita electrica was very nice, and we ordered chips and salsa. Chips are cold but salsa was spicy and great.

Super cool tequila bar in DUMBO which we enjoyed thoroughly! Great put very petite guacamole and salsa for $16 which is pretty steep considering how tiny the portions were but totally cool place! I would definitely come back here for happy hour and more cocktails and ceviche next time.

The portions are absurdly small.

$16 for the Quesadilla entree (literally just one tortilla folded in half, cut into 2 pieces).

$15 for Queso Fundido app (came with maybe 10 tortilla chips)

You would think this was a tapas place...

It was good food, but I needed maybe 3x more food to consider it a meal.

Food was great. We went inside quite late like almost 10pm for dinner but itwas really busy which we thought it must be good. However the service was extremely TERRIBLE. We were not be served anything at all. We need to call staff on our own for just a still water for the table (staffs here are also really difficult to get their attentions, everyone of them were walking by pretending that they were so rush doing their own tasks). Finally we caught a guy to take our order and that was when he gave us water. Then after that no one else really gave us attention that water was out, dishes were finished and table need to be cleared, dessert menu needs to be presented, and drinks were done, should have offered more..... nothing like that here.

Eventually we got attention by a bar staff and we complained how terrible the service here, hence we won't give any tips then she went to call the manager for us to speak to. Extremely appreciated for manager who received our complaint nicely, professionally and offered us free drinks. Somehow, the feeling of nice food, great ambience, lovely deco were all gone by the toxic service team here. Definitely didn't give them good tips.

If you're in the area & looking for your Mexican food cravings to be satisfied, this is the spot. The location isn't too bad either, located in Brooklyn but closer to the bridges so you're really just a hop on a subway or walk across the bridge from the beautiful city of Manhattan.
This spot is the perfect cross between the cultures in the city of Brooklyn. The flavors will give you a feeling you've never experienced before. Savor the lengua tacos & enjoy the delicacy of the beautiful surroundings.
The venue is really nice. The wallpaper screams art literally. You're surrounded by a wallpaper design of sugar skulls in different settings.
Plus, the servers always make sure that your cup is full.

Loved their margaritas and their tacos were delicious if not pricey

They are strict about waiting for the full party to be there in order for you to be seated, but they gave us free delicious appetizers while we waited at the bar for the rest of our party

This is a small plate place and I don't know why that isn't advertised. We came here for a friend's birthday dinner. The hostess was great, the table we had was in their back room with a crying child and she said they could set up another table in 15min if we were willing to wait at the bar which we were. We ordered their two quesadillas to start (we were a group of 6). The quesadillas were TINY, it looked like someone cut a quesadilla into 8 and gave us two pieces. They were tasty though. We ordered guacamole which came out in a minuscule cup, about the size of coleslaw that comes with your sandwich at a diner. So we ordered a second. Again it was good, but far too small a portion. Then we got entrees which were the size of appetizers. The al pastor was a small cup of rice with some pork along the side of the plate with two leeks. The tacos are really small (about 4 inch tortillas) and the chile relleno was filled with only cheese so it was akin to eating a bowl of melted cheese. The chile was inedible and came drowned in a mole sauce. Definitely would not order that again.
The prices are quite expensive given the portion sizes and we were barely satiated after the meal. I would not go back and they should make it known that they are a small plates restaurant.

Had to downgrade to 1 star due to the hostess and her attitude or personal problem.

We came here on a Thursday night around 6pm, bar area was packed and we put our names down for a table. There were two hosts there, the male host welcomes us with a big smile, while the female hostess just stared blankly at me without making any facial expression. OK you hate your job, not my problem.

Anyways, it's over 95 degrees out there, and near the door where we were waiting the AC really wasn't working. I felt a lot warmer than normal due to pregnancy so I started using their menu as fan to cool myself down. To be fair, it's not the best use of their bar menu, but it's clipped on a hardboard so I was really using the hardboard to provide a little breeze without really touching the menu. Then for 1 min I put down the menu to check my phone, the poker-faced hostess made a point to walk over and put up the menu against the wall. Is she trying to tell me not to use that as a fan? Unfortunately that's my only resort and I ain't gonna give it up. Look around, do you not see people are sweating? If you want people not to use menu as fan, maybe turn up the damn AC??

We were seated promptly after all parties arrived. Their dining room felt a lot cooler, and our waitress was amazing. We got the usual, chips and salsa and guacamole, fish tacos, lamb barbacoa. We were just starting to enjoy ourselves, the hostess, who came into the dining room to seat some other guests, tapped on my shoulder and asked me to move in my chair so people can walk. I looked around, everyone else's chair was as far out as mine, and none of the waiters/waitresses have bumped into my chair since we sat down. I told her there's nowhere to move and showed my preggo belly. She rolled her eyes, and walked away. Maybe she still couldn't get over me using bar menu as fan, but sorry lady, do not ever ask a pregnant woman to do things that are unreasonable, it would never work!

Apologies for the long description, back to food. I only get fish tacos here because some other dishes I've tried before weren't as great. The lamb barbacoa was a bit on the dry side, but flavor was good. I was pretty satisfied. To the restaurant: (1) train the hostess better, or replace her. Clearly she doesn't like her job and holds grudges against whatever that doesn't even make sense. (2) TURN UP the AC by the door on a hot day.

This place is more popular than I thought! We came here on a Tuesday night around 7:30pm without a reservation, and the wait was about 30min. Luckily the bar was wide open so we sat down. The interior is dark with a feel of wood and metal (say industrial chic?) Supposedly they have a courtyard so I will have to try next time.

We got some cocktails, ceviche, fish taco, and beef brisket taco.  I'm not a big margarita fan, which seems to be the one drink everyone else was getting. My sangria was decent, and my husband's drink was good too. Ceviche was pretty amazing, fish and shrimp were fresh, tastes were perfectly balanced by acidity from lime, creaminess of avocado and bitterness of radish. LOVE LOVE.  Fish in taco was perfectly fried - batter was not too thick and fish inside was tender and moist. Beef taco was a little inconsistent - some chunks of meat were more chewy than the others, but the flavors were pretty good.

I will need to make reservation to come back soon so I can try other things!

Nice atmosphere but average food. Food is a bit on the pricier side and the restaurant does not offer complimentary chips and salsa. I ordered the Carnitas tacos ($12 for 2). The taco was good but on the dry side and did not come with any sides. The restaurant was very lively on a Thursday night- a great atmosphere to socialize with friends.

I love this restaurant: the ambiance, the people, the food and the drinks. Textures and flavors are above and beyond. I recommend this restaurant to anyone who appreciates innovation and creativity in cuisine, but craves comfort and familiarity. Gran Electrica is both.

I come here every time I'm in New York, and the experience is always amazing. Located right in Dumbo, it's a really great location. Good vibes throughout the entire restaurant, and has a nice aesthetic. I love the candles and the lighting, the bar set up is also super cute.

I usually order the fish tacos, and they're always delicious and fresh. They're very filling and a great value for what you pay. Also, their guacamole is so delicious. A good selection of drinks, and the servers are always great for providing recommendations.

Good place to go to after viewing the sightseeing, a bit pricey but worth it, yuca Frita is a must try, the pickled  onionS and the green salsa were good. Would've loved the tortillas to be handmade for the price. Overall pleasant experience

Went to Gran El√©ctrica last night and it was great.  Food, drinks, service all lovely.  We ordered the yucca fries, chorizo queso fundido and carnitas tacos (ok so I wasn't vegetarian for the evening.). But the main thing was...  I was there w a potential suitor and the waiter let us stay for hours.  It wasn't super packed but he didn't rush us to leave and it was very kind of the mgmt to do this.  I would definitely go back (suitor or not!) bc it was such a pleasant experience.  Also the table next to us was having a wedding party and the couple and their friends were adorable. :)

What a gem! We would have never found this place it, if it wasn't recommended by the staff at Grimaldi's. The margaritas are truly creative and taste just as delicious as they are designed. We loved the vibe and had a great time hanging out at the bar relaxing. The bartender took excellent care of us and made us feel welcomed from the moment we walked in. We will definitely try to return on a trip back to New York.

Some quality modernized Latin food right here. The vibe the place had was quite unique with the DJ, funky wallpaper, and stringed lights. Though earning outside on the patio is a MUST. The margs frickin slapped! The food itself was moderately priced but also small portion sizes. I recommend getting a side with your meal (the refried beans were quality).

My friends and I were walking around Dumbo on a Friday night, and saw this place under the Brooklyn Bridge. We went in, and we're so glad we did! This is one of the coolest bars I've ever seen! They take great pride in crafting their cocktails, and making sure your drink is exactly how you thought it would be. This isn't your typical bar, every cocktail is handcrafted by organic Mexican spirits.
The bathrooms are very clean, and very big. I didn't order here, just had a couple drinks with my friends. The bar area is amazing, and we were treated very well by Everyone we came in contact with! I would definitely Come back to this place in the future!

Friend visiting from out West said he wanted Italian, Frankies immediately came to mind. We didn't have a reservation but the hostess managed to seat us at a 4-top in the back. Scan the QR code for menu and consider the specials as well.

I started with the lentil soup ($10), a simple starter that reminded me of my mom's recipe, though hers is better, of course. My party divvied up the table bread ($4), tearing hunks off and dipping in oil and butter. I worked hard to save room for my main course.

Entree: sweet sausage with roasted peppers and onions over creamy polenta ($19). Impulsively (but correctly), I mixed it all together, ensuring even distributions in each bite.

The verdict? I loved it. The peppers were plentiful and roasted exquisitely. The sauce mingled with the polenta creating a delicious base with a superb mouth feel. The sausage was also ideal, contributing to a delicious sum total.

My guests were fairly pleased with the experience, but I had the best time. If you want something wholesome, charming, potentially romantic, and very comfy, give this a try. They've got their Covid game figured out, and the food was to die for.

A couple tips to help make your visit to Frankies 457 Spuntino super delicious and excellent:
-Even/Especially during these COVID times, make a reservation.
-If a big party (4 or more), order a pasta dish as an appetizer. We went with the sweet potato ravioli and the heirloom salad (app) and I thought that was a perfect amount.
-Order the gnocchi!!! The BEST gnocchi I've ever had. So fluffy, not dense at all. I licked that plate clean.
-Be patient. Yes, service is a little on the slower end. But again, during these COVID times, where else ya going? For me, the food was worth the wait.

Frankies 457 Spuntino was an excellent spot for lunch in Brooklyn. They have a great outdoor space which felt safe and comfortable during COVID-19.

My Mom and I ordered the caesar salad and cavatelli with hot sausage. The caesar was made with a purist approach: fairly simple, just lettuce covered in dressing. The dressing was full of flavor and brought a complexity to the simple elements of the dish. The salad was well portioned and could easily be split between two people.

Next up was the cavatelli, I'd never seen this kind of pasta before but absolutely loved it. The sausage was perfectly cooked and well seasoned. The sauce was a nice complement to the pasta and meat. Definitely recommend this dish!

Overall great service and a nice place for lunch in Carroll Gardens!

I love the food here. I've come more than a couple of times and it has never disappointed me.

Covid-19 rules are followed. The outdoor sitting as well as the patio area are equally enjoyable.. The plus of sitting outside (as opposed to the patio) is the eclectic/funky/cool/diverse crowd the neighborhood has to offer (anyone else loves to people watch as much as I do).

FOOD is an a+ ambiance, decor and service are fantastic.

Everything about dinner remains true to original review.

Before CV-19 hit it was a major treat to join Frankies for lunch/brunch. These are times I truly miss that luxury. I had discovered that their BLT is the most heavenly sandwich you could ask for. From the perfectly firm yet doughy bread, to the right amount of mayo, to the thick cut faico bacon, the deep red, just thick enough tomato and the crisp snap of a single slab of lettuce you're in heaven with one bite. After 8 bites you're probably finished wondering if you should order another.

I'm a big fan of Frankies. They have become synonymous with Carroll Gardens and for good reason. The best way to describe Frankie's atmosphere is cozy - it exudes that feeling like you've just come home after a long day. It's warm in the winter and open and airy during the summer.

Good thing they have incredible food to welcome you with! There's staples you can absolutely never go wrong with. My top pick on this list remains the cavatelli (House-Made Cavatelli $18.00). It's freshly made and skinny dipping in a browned butter sage sauce with faiccos sausage - unforgettable. A close second would be the meatballs. They are a bit simpler (and a smaller portion) but brimming with flavor including a touch of sweetness from the raisins delicately hidden throughout and delicately waist deep in some scrumptious red sauce (ask for extra bread).

Outside of those go-tos I'd highly recommend the Sweet Potato & Sage Ravioli $16.00 - which offers a great balance across savory and sweet. Of course starting with a crostini of anything is the right thing to do if you plan on enjoying a few drinks.

To close your palate, you'll be delighted to have a world class tiramisu. You'd expect this at a traditional quality Italian restaurant but Frankie's just double-strikes the meal with a perfectly airy/dense ratio and espresso topped treat.

Sit out back in the summer and close to the kitchen in the winter. Find you're having to wait, squeeze into the bar if you can and order a nice glass of wine.

Pro Tip: get their cookbook and see if you can truly top their own chefs (I've perfected the meatball according to my 7 year-old & wife).

We have been coming to Frankies for years, and have never had less than a magical time.  Food and service have always been top notch.  I am loathe to write this review, as I understand Covid has wreaked havoc on the industry and everyone is struggling to adapt in these crazy times.  However...

Our night started off on the wrong foot.  I had reserved a table for two on a Saturday night - indoors.  The hostess led us to a table outside under a tent by the open door with no heat lamp.  It was a frigid.  We asked our server if they were considering tent seating ""indoors"" - he said something to the effect of ""indoors, outdoors, who knows anymore?""  Which was ridiculous, because the second time we asked, we were led to a table - indoors, as in, inside the restaurant.

Our server then proceeded to instruct us that when he was dropping off food or drinks on our table we should put our masks back on.   This was very awkward - at one point, I couldn't find my mask and he literally refused to put our food down on the table until I put a napkin over my face.  He also approached our table as if we were actively infected and he could see the Covid spores crawling all over us.  This might have been understandable or acceptable if the same request was made at every table!  Our same server was also waiting on a four top next to us - they remained unmasked throughout the duration of their meal. We felt like lepers!

Since the pandemic began, we have been doing everything possible to support our local restaurants.  We were under the impression that they wanted our business, and we were very happy to patronize them.  We had been looking forward to to eating a Frankies and we spent a good deal of money on our wine and dinner.  Unfortunately, the message we walked away with was that we should have just stayed home.

All that being said, food is still excellent.  The restaurant was freezing - maybe five degrees warmer than eating outdoors.  Dress appropriately.

I question whether I truly know what authentic Italian food is because I didn't like anything we ordered. Besides great service provided, Alex and I weren't thrilled with $123 bill for 2 small entrees (Cavatelli with Hot sausage and Bolognase), 3 formaggio (cheeses) and 2 old fashions.

All these great reviews and I couldn't agree less.

Not worth the money . Save your trip and time and go somewhere else .. out of all the staff I think the host are the most politest. Waitresses don't know how to talk to customers . Also be ready to wear your masks every single time the server comes up to you before they tell you impolitely to wear one  . So listen to the negative reviews you see ... If your hungry I would not come here ... Food portions are really small and a bit pricey which I don't mind paying as long as the food is worth the price. We had the Linguine short rib the chicken parm ( was really good but not hot ) and the gnocchi in pesto was good but again I would not pay for it again nor recommend. Drinks were great ! You get no bread for the table in the beginning... we had to order bread which was like 4.00 again not worth it and strange to not serve bread in the beginning of dinner . Should've listen to my friends not recommending this place but I really wanted to give it a try which I'm happy I did so I know not to recommend or visit again . Bill was around 125 left At least 18 , Should've just went to the city !

Horrible service. Asked for fresh pepper and was provided pepper packets as if I was at McDonald's... if I'm dropping 200+ on a meal and some wine you better get it right. This isn't Olive Garden. Head to Misi or Lilia and forget this once amazing spot.

Disappointed by food and service.
Orecchiette with sausage - brown butter sauce nothing special and sausage very fat (not to mention like ~1/8th pound pasta for $28 and no fresh grated parmesan ir pepper offered).
Sausage and peppers over polenta - polenta was soupy (think grits accidentally made with too much water) and just fell apart resulting in a big bowl of mush (not to mention that the s&p was not even tasty enough to make up for the failed polenta).
If you're looking for yummy Italian in an atmosphere where you feel at home and taken care of, consider looking elsewhere.

Tosca and her team at Frankies made our 25-person outdoor wedding an absolute dream come true. We could not have asked for more in terms of venue, food, and service. Due to covid and weather issues, we had to redo our seating chart multiple times. We also had various guests with dietary restrictions. Frankies was not only accommodating, they went above and beyond to make our day stress free and seamless. Our guests absolutely loved the experience and we had the best time ever. I highly recommend Tosca and Frankies if you are hoping to plan an intimate celebration (with or without covid.)

I really did want to like this place..mostly because of all the hype and the 45 minutes of my life i spent waiting to eat but..

We got:
- tagliatelle bolognese 6/10: was a pretty average dish, definitely not worth the $23. Tasted like something i couldve made at home, although the pasta itself was quite good. But the sauce and flavors lay flat
- gnocchi 5/10: the gnocchi was reaaaaaaaally soft, im not sure if they were going for that soft doughy texture but it just tasted severely undercooked to me.

Service was noticeably bad (and i dont even notice service ever), it took forever to get anything - especially to order. Also, there was a table ready but they didn't seat us for at least another 10 minutes for some strange reason..?
Also not really within their control but peeved me anyways was that there's only one bathroom for the whole establishment and it is literally in the middle of the restaurant. Practically begs for a traffic collision when you open the door.

Overall, definitely not worth the hype or the wait. Maybe the hype is around the atmosphere...? I really dont get it. Save yourself some everything and go eat at any number of the restaurants nearby.

Frankie's has become an institution. Known for many things, but manly some of the best Pasta in Brooklyn.

Frankie's is a charming spot right in Carrol Gardens. They just expanded, now enabling you to make a reservation and not fret about getting a seat.

The wine selection and cocktail list are pretty big, so you won't worry about finding what to drink. Just make sure you pair it well with your food. I love the octopus here. Definitely get that as your stater. As for the main course, you got to go with one of the pastas. None of them are bad. But I definitely recommend getting the one with sausage.

The service here is also top notch. The wait staff is fantastic. I also noticed an error with a bill awhile back, when I called up the manager fixed it right away.

A great spot for all occasions.

Every trip to New York, I prioritize getting good Italian food, and I'm so glad a friend told me about Frankie's!

THE WAIT: None on a Friday at 11:00 a.m. (when they opened). By the time we left around noon, the restaurant was almost full but still no wait.

THE COST: Incredibly reasonable. $105.06 before tips for lunch for three!

MUST-HAVES: Meatballs, Tagliatelle, Gnocchi. (My friend loved the Cavatelli but it's not for me as a pasta served more al dente.)

See my photos for more details!

There are a lot of Frankies and its confusing. This one is the original and down the block is Franks which is split into two places. A wine bar with an app menu and a reservation only side. Then there is one in Manhattan.

This one was okay. Average food and high prices. I liked the rustic atmoshpere and we sat by the window. Thier backyard is gorgeous and they have a courtyard too which looks like for weddings and other events.

17 dollars for eggplant marinara. Came with no pasta and was just eggplant in red sauce. It tasted good but not worth 17 dollars and not filling. My boyfried ordered the cavatelli with sausage. 22 dollars. The cavatelli was very good. Homemade and in a brown butter sage sauce. I'm lucky he let me eat half. The sausage I didn't care for. Too spicy for my tastes and the flavor itself I didnt like. Portions average size.

Cocktails at 14 dollars I guess is pretty typical. The spritz was actually really good. My boyfriend's drink tasted like medicine to me though, I forgot what it was called, something with bird in the title.

Overpriced average food, wouldn't come back but glad we tried it.

This is the place that does the Resy backyard chef collaborations

I can only attest to place as a wedding venue and the food that was served for the wedding.

The backyard space was amazing, tasteful, and intimate.
The food for the wedding was

1. A bunch on crostini(mushroom, pesto, chick pea, honey ricotta)- all amazing
2. Salad-very good
3. Two house made cavatellis( sausage and cauliflower) both amazing
4. Damn good meatballs with pine nuts
5. Gnocchi-light as air in tomato sauce
6. Chocolate ganache and light as air cheesecake

Awesome and friendly service. Super attentive. Can't wait to come back for regular meal service

*Only one can in backyard venue

After coming here for years since they opened, I chose Frankies to be my first sit down meal since Covid.   I wanted someplace safe and most importantly served great food.  Frankie delivered! I had the beets and avocado salad, the meatballs and shared the cavatelli and sausage. It was divine to sit outside in the breezy back patio drinking wine and leisurely enjoy a sumptuous delicious meal that just hit all the right notes of familiar and exciting at the same time.

The menu is smaller but the favorites are all there.  Service continues to be both professional and friendly.  All the patrons we saw, kept there masks on except when they were eating or drinking.  The patio is shaded and tables are well spaced.

I try my best to give people the benefit of the doubt. Honestly, I will. But Frankies 457 was not a great experience.

We walked in and asked for a table. We were quoted an hour to an hour and a half (which was fine). They called us back under an hour, for which we were grateful.

But as soon as we sat down, they told us about half the entree menu wasn't available due to an engagement party in the backyard. This included all the grill items, including the main fish and chicken dishes (they literally had no other chicken dish available, and just one fish sandwich otherwise). Would've been great to know this when we were making a reservation. It's not like they didn't know this was the case.

And then halfway into our meal, our server came over and told us we were accidentally given the wrong table. He asked if we would be willing to move in exchange for a round of free drinks. Sounded like a great deal, right? So we agreed. They made it sound like they would time it so we would move before we got our entrees, but it actually happened in the middle of them. So.... not great. And then after we move, he told us he couldn't comp us drinks and instead gave us a free dessert worth about 1/3 of our second round of drinks (that we ALREADY ordered). Seriously, what the fuck?

Also, their menu doesn't specify that adding soda to drinks costs $1, but it does. So if you get a campari or aperol with soda, expect an unexpected surcharge.

If we didn't have to deal with being jerked around, this would be a 4 or 5 star experience. But I honestly can't do that with the service we got.

I will say that the olive oil is as good as you've heard (maybe not worth the price you'd pay in a Brooklyn gourmet store, but still REALLY good). And they'll give you all the sourdough bread you ask for.

The crostini are tiny, but also delicious. The crab/avocado one is $6 and smaller than half your hand, but oh so fresh. And the ricotta/speck is similarly fresh AF.

The pork bolognese tagliatelle is also very good. Maybe not $22 good, but very good nonetheless, with big hunks of meat in it.

The staff was otherwise very kind to us, but they should really be better at setting expectations.

Not bad, but not worth the hype.

Came on NYE with a reservation for the dining room. The dining room was loud and big with straightforward lighting, reminding me of a traditional red sauce restaurant, rather than a chic neighborhood haunt. Based on my knowledge of Frankies Spuntino Group, I expected a more contemporary space/ambiance, but I guess that is not the focus at this location.

Onto the food - for a big night like NYE, the specials really weren't all that exciting, so we went ahead and ordered the much-lauded cavatelli with sausage, as well as an antipasto plate and the meatball parm. They were all pretty solid, and the cavatelli is every bit as good as people say it is. The meatball parm felt a bit dry without enough sauce.

Bottom line, I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to come here. There are more outstanding Italian spots (like Supper by the other Frank.. oop) around the city.

On a random summer night we were looking for somewhere close by to eat and decided to try some Italian! We'd heard good things about this place but were a little disappointed in the end...

While the food here was decent, our service was not. We waited on end for our waitress, even though it wasn't very busy and we were one of the few customers.

The menu is a little limited if you have meat restrictions, but what we got was fresh and delicious! A little bland for our tastes (we tend to love spices and Indian foods) but still tasty and fresh.

My boyfriend and I went here to celebrate our four year anniversary and I think it was our yummiest anniversary dinner yet! We shared the gnocchi and cavatelli and neither of us could tell which we liked better. I also got their blood orange cocktail and it was so delicious. There are multiple great outdoor areas for a social distance dining. The waiters and waitresses wore masks and wouldn't even walk up with drinks or food until you popped your mask on. I felt very safe and would def go eat there again! Make a reservation because this place is popping!

Just the best. Ate here for the first time since COVID and was surprised and delighted at their outdoor oasis behind the restaurant and storefront. The pasta impressed me every time and the appetizers & specials are always great. The staff was so friendly and attentive even masked-up.

4.5 stars. Part of the multiple Frankies related establishments on this block, we started at the one of the corner and couldn't get a table because it was booked for the night, a beautiful fall Sunday evening. The hostess called over to this one - maybe 30 steps away - and scored us a table under the string lighting and trees of the beautiful backyard. To get there, you walk through the bustle of the narrow entryway, busy bar, line for the one bathroom, and a maze of tables with loud chatter.

Then you are outside and it feels tranquil and subdued, although definitely still full of people. We had aperol spritzes, scarfed down the table bread (we were hungry), and had the burrata and a couple of the crostinis (tiny for $6 each order, but the avocado and crab one was very tasty). Entrees were simple, a yummy red sauce pasta dinner for me and the bolognese for my love. All in all, a lovely setting for a nice date night, if a bit on the pricy side.

This review would have been a three star review, and my last point below is where it came down to two.
I came here with three work folks and we opted to eat outside in the courtyard. The restaurant and courtyard are charming and pretty nice atmosphere for dining.
Our server came over and said there were no specials, everything was standard menu. We ordered some wine, a $95 bottle high acidity red to cut some of the richness of the food we were about to have.
Long story short, some of the food was better than others. (The only option for an a la carte side of broccoli rabe and garlic is for it to be served cold? Come on.)
Service was okay In the beginning with a slightly goofy waiter but rapidly deteriorated with the stops to our table becoming more infrequent as the night progressed. When we wanted to leave, we had to downright wave our arms.
Lost a star because upon delivering the wine, the server announced that he would be taking it back to the station to open and taste it for us. What?? This isn't 11 Madison or Le Berardin? I want every drop of the wine I paid for and unless you are in the highest level of formality l, the customer decide if the wine is acceptable. I didn't realize the waiter at an Italian joint in Carroll Gardens was a certified sommelier all of a sudden. When we questioned this upon his return, he said ""what? Oh yeah in high end restaurants this is customary."" So shocked we didn't even respond.
Oh by the way, one of our party on the way out saw him off to the side finishing off the last half glass of a bottle a customer left behind. Bizarre. Won't be back.

Frankie's is so great, they have always had such great food and service. They work really hard to make sure everyone is taken care of here and it shows. I've visited them a few times since they reopened during Covid and I'm so glad that they are taking it all very seriously. I really appreciate that they ask you to wear a mask when you are not eating or drinking, the team is doing a great job keeping everyone safe, while still delivering great food.

Please do yourself a favor and go elsewhere.  Over rated - food was mediocre at best.  Portions are a bit small - presentation of food not appealing. The staff could really take a refresher course on how to treat and speak to their customers . Our waitress was impatient and a friendly smile would have definitely been asking way too much from her.

First, Frankies is one of my long time favorites in New York.  I go here for drinks at Frank's, food at Frankie's and a quick slice at F&F.  I've always experienced excellent service, above most in New York.  That said, I have been itching to go back and have a nice dinner following their reopening amid COVID-19, and had a strangely horrible experience.  While I give them the credit for navigating the complexities of running a business during these times, what I experienced was contrary to basic hospitality principles that should extend beyond the current COVID-19 regulation.

I put my name in for the waitlist at Frankies, and when I was text for a place at a table, I was told that they actually didn't have a table ready.  They did feel bad and offered a glass of wine, and told me to hang tight another 20 minutes for a table.  I gladly did this and was seated 20 minutes later at their outdoor seating outside Frank's (their sister wine bar).  After waiting for another 15 minutes, I poked my head inside to ask my waiter if I could order food because the QR code I was given only had wines.  I was then told that they can't do Frankie's food menu here but the waiter understood the miscommunication and said he'd go try and sort it out with the host who sat me.  After waiting another 15-20 minutes, the waiter didn't come back so I poked my head inside again to see what was going on, to which I was told that they can't serve me over here and they would be happy to sit me somewhere else where I could order food in another 20-30 minutes.  This was appalling, I felt embarrassed, so I just go up and left after waiting for probably an hour in total.  I don't know if I was treated this way because it was just me and I didn't have a huge party, but I will definitely rethink the next time I plan an event and want to go to my stable neighborhood favorite!!

I used to come here frequently and I think it's great that they opened for outdoor dining however, you should not ask customers that are sitting at the table eating to put their mask on every single time a server comes to the table, especially midway eating. This is very uncomfortable and very irritating to keep taking it on and off when you have food in your mouth and this is the only restaurant that does this. If staff feels some type of way about serving during this time, then don't serve and don't keep wearing the same gloves to handle everyone's food without changing them.

We also were refused coffee , as we were told ""we only serve the bare minimum."" I was just wondering what COVID has to do with coffee ? These places want to make money or not ? Serving an espresso and a tiramisu won't increase your changes of catching the virus.

7/17/2020Hi Lisa: Thank you for your feedback. We're sorry to hear you were inconvenienced by our safety protocols. We should clarify that we only require masks when guests are not at their table. That said, we do appreciate those who choose to wear a mask whenever interacting with a server to help protect them when they are at your table.  Our menu is currently limited and unfortunately we aren't serving coffee right now due to supply chain issues.  However, we are working hard to expand our menu over the coming weeks and appreciate your feedback.  These are difficult times, so we thank you for your patronage over the years and especially now.

This is one of New York's best restaurants and even more so during COVID because of their beautiful backyard. Highlights include perfectly fresh burrata, the most-authentic Caeser this side of the Atlantic, a delectable slow-roasted cold-sliced rib eye, and mouth-watering gnocchi. Only thing I don't recommend is the cacio e pepe, which is over peppered causing the buttery cheese taste to be completely lost in a dish that is meant to symbolize the Italian version of perfect balance (like yin and yang).

Food was cooked and prepared fresh! I ordered the Polenta and Bolognese. Was greeted by the hostess and sat quickly on a busy Saturday night.

Warm ambiance and upbeat music/ atmosphere. The place is live- it does have a lot going on (loud environment, kitchen cooks in front) but thats what keeps it lively.

The waitress was very friendly and made sure the dishes were out in a timely manner. Polenta was creamy and rich. The topping red peppers were not too sweet and onions complimented the sauce well. Very balanced and proportioned. Overall, I would give this a 8/10. The only downfall was the portion was small, but I think the restaurant was going for the 'small plates style'.

The Bolognese was very flavorful and seasoned thorougly. Taste was very warm and noodles were light and delicious. Very meaty! Overall, i would give this dish a 8.6/ 10.

Good pasta and vibes, great for a pleasant evening.

Maybe it was just the pleasantness of the restaurant, the whiff of olive oil in the air, but this particular restaurant delivered an almost perfect meal.

We arrived, off-hour but reservation-less, mid-afternoon on a Saturday, and the place was already packed. We put our name on the list, got our waitlist doo-dad, and sooner, rather than later, our number was called.

Our waiters were gracious, the drinks wonderful, but the highlight was the pasta. In particular, the sweet potato ravioli was beyond comparison. Just  a really, really satisfying dish.

In fact, while the pastas weren't incredibly complex, each and every dish we had was special in its simplicity.

I think that's the recipe for success for this restaurant (an experience which we still think about on occasion). Simple, but special. Good times, man...

Where to begin... cavatelli with sausage and browned butter *chefs kiss* is a must order! One of the best pasta dishes I've ever had.

Other faves are the gnocci and the meatballs they're out of this world. All the crostinis are good but I love the mushroom/truffle and ricotta ones.

Make sure to leave room for the chocolate tart or tiramisu!!

This place was recommended to me by a coworker and it did not disappoint! We ordered 3 difference types of cheese, meatballs, cavatelli, gnocchi, and wine (of course).

The cheese was amazing. Great portions and lovely flavor. Same with the meatballs. They paired really nicely together. Both pasta dishes were delicious, although I would go with the gnocchi over the cavatelli only due to the cavatelli being a little too salty for my taste.

One of Brooklyn's great Italian Restaurants. Newly added wine bar a few doors down from the original has the same menu, look and feel, with more room.  The space is very comfortable, with lots of wood paneling reminiscent of a high end steakhouse, a wonderful skylight that makes the lighting very nice.
The food is outstanding here. The cavatelli with sausage is a knockout.  You MUST order, if only to share with your party as we did.
Not everything was perfect:  the salads were just ok, and the service failed to time our meal properly. (Received entree before appetizer and salad was served with entree). Of the eight of us, two people had to wait another ten minutes for their meal.  Server seemed clueless. Five star rating forfeited because of dysfunctional service.
Other than that, we really enjoyed our brunch here.

Can't find a bad thing to say about this place!! Service was just about spot on and the food was interesting as well as delicious. We shared two apps  roasted beets with avocado and the fresh bufula mozzarella with arugula. Both were yum. There were 5 of us and each one of us loved there dish. I had the gnocchi topped with ricotta which was mind blowing delicious and oh so filling. The other pastas had were the lemon pasta, bolognese, and there was an eggplant parm too. I'll need to go back to try some of the other dishes, when I get the chance too.

Good, but overpriced and with too small/limited a menu. My boyfriend moved in right down the block from Frankie's in April and we've been ordering from there a lot. Your first order on seamless is 35% off which is what hooked us.

Generally, I get the gnocchi with marinara and he gets the cavatelli with brown butter, sage, and sausage. The pastas are $19 and $21, respectively. I think for the portion size and the fact that the gnocchi is incredibly simple and meatless, they're both steeply overpriced. The meatballs ($19 I think) are large and delicious. Bread and olive oil is $3.50 and the last time I ordered it it was the most outrageously small piece of bread. Think the size of a dinner roll. If you're going to make people pay for bread and olive oil, at least give a more generous hunk.

Along with one other pasta dish, one sausage dish, and some sandwiches, that's pretty much the whole menu. Really not many choices. I think the plan is to expand it when Prime Meats closes/is merged with Frankie's.

All in all, definitely worth a try once, especially since that 35% off is killer. Does it deserve its buzz though? I say no

They're doing delivery now and it travels super well. Their Caesar salad is incomparable, the cavatelli is sumptuous, the sweet potato ravioli is delicate and silky, and how can we not get the meatballs?? My husband said they're
like his Sicilian grandmother's but better. So glad they're doing their eggplant now too and excited to try the gnocchi with pesto - the one with marinara is a classic. Welcome back Frankies!

I was back in the city for a mid-COVID return and needed to make a Pig Beach stop, if only for the pre-pandemic nostalgia. The construction going on next door and very tight COVID restrictions make Pig Beach feel a bit apocalyptic, but I appreciate their caution. We waited for other guests to leave, then they took temperatures and had one of us write down our info for contact tracing if needed.

The food was just as incredible as I remembered. I had the pulled pork sandwich both times (last visit was summer 2019), and the mac and cheese side (HEAVEN - I legitimately dream about this mac). Last time it had goldfish topping and this time it was Cheez-Its. Incredible. I got the cornbread side last time, which was great, and went for the coleslaw this time around. I forgot that they give you coleslaw for the sandwich already, so ended up taking the slaw side home for leftovers, but all was delicious and I'm honestly drooling thinking about it now...

My ONE tiny downside was that the bun for the pulled pork got really mushy and fell apart. Maybe a sturdier bun would be better. But honestly such a minor complaint compared to how finger-licking delicious everything was!

AMAZING ! Meat heaven. The brisket sandwich, the wings, the CORN BREADDDDDD (if there is any left by time you get there) IT IS ALL AMAZING !

Due to Covid- Mike the host, keeps the line moving. He is informative, and a grand entrance to this food heaven. (View mike in photo attached ) during this visit GOTHAM BURGER SOCIAL CLUB WAS a vendor (10/11/20) and if heaven could have visits that what having Gotham burger social club was like.

I loved to the Bronx within the last year and for my 2 year anniversary I planned a date to PIG BEACH because the food and vibe is THAT GOOD .

Yes - alcoholic drinks
Yes - dog friendly
Yes - kids friends
Yes to being too full to get home

Pretty good place, great vibe to hang out and eat (only for an hour), but little expensive and not many options. I'd like to see combo platters, 1/4 lb or 1/4 racks, and a bread side. My true rating is a 3, but giving them the benefit of the doubt during this covid time. I might come back to try some of their sandwiches.

Coleslaw: best thing out of what we got. Light, crunchy, with a very slight kick.

Brisket: got a mix of fatty and lean pieces. Tasted pretty good and goes well with sauces.

Ribs: Wet sauce pork ribs seemed fairly tender, maybe a little over cooked. Not sure if they have an option for dry or beef ribs.

Mac n cheese: nothing special, sauce seemed kind of too wet.

Pig Beach was definitely a hit! I had planned to have BBQ with a friend at another established in the area but it was all booked. Thanks to Yelp, I was able to do a quick search and do what I like to call, ""turn the beat around"". Yelp gave me a few options but I selected Pig island and I'm so glad I did.

After arriving at Pig Beach not to be confused with Pig Island which is another event in the area, I put my name on the waiting list. On a nice summer even, waiting list are to be expected especially when BBQ is on the menu. Not to worry tho because while waiting, you can enjoy one of their fabulous drinks and might I add, their fros√© is fantastic.

So after waiting a bit, we were seated and we're promptly given the ground rules of ordering both drinks and food. Like most places now, there is Qr code menu or you can always review it on your phone using Yelp. I got the ribs and my friend got the brisket and wings. The BBQ was excellent and the drinks were equally as good. The menu has a few sides to choose from and I'm sure you will find one that will suit your fancy. Mac and cheese is always a favorite of mine, a guilty pleasure in the mist of carb counting. I'm a big fan of BBQ and Pig Beach will be placed in heavy rotation for the remainder of the summer.

Good to be back! Vibes are different but it's still the same ole Pig Beach. Fire BBQ & yummy drinks. Just a little less standing & intermingling

Hospitality is spectacular! I came here with my boyfriend and the host was very clear with the protocol. On each table, there's a bar code. You scan the bar code and it shows you the menu. Once you know what you want to order, you walk up to the food line and order. Same thing goes for drinks, you have to go to the drink line for drinks. If you step away from your table to get on line, you need to wear a mask.
We ordered the pulled pork sandwich, fries, pickles, pig beach burger (double) and cole slaw. I highly recommend the pig beach burger and the pulled pork sandwich with pickles because it's the best meals on the menu! Cocktails were very delicious and perfect. Will definitely come back before the summer is over
Bonus points: you can bring your dog and they provide them with water!

OH MY GOODNESS.

Brisket is bomb. Sauces are bomb. The spot is bomb. Staff is bomb. I need to come back to get the ribs, because it looked like heaven.

I am so glad my boyfriend picked this spot. I have been craving good ol' American barbecue for the longest. LONGEST. After work and before heading to an archery spot, we made our way to Pig Beach and it did not disappoint. He loved his Pulled Pork Sandwich. I loved my Brisket Sandwich (hands down my favorite sandwich). We tried all the sauces and they were amazing! Key Lime pie was a classic and the cornbread was alright (not bad but not my favorite). Still a good treat. You get to stuff your face with all these flavors and it doesn't cost you much. I would recommend anyone that loves barbecue to come here. I can't wait to see how this place gets lacked in the summer. SERIOUSLY VISIT THIS PLACE!

Went out first time in 6 months, and I must say pig beach was the right choice of venue to break the quarantine ice. Place is very strict on following the social distancing and mask protocol, host is super friendly and informative yet assertive which I truly appreciate. Food is delicious, My husband and I had double burger and fries, friend had pull pork sandwich and we shared Mac n cheese and cold slaw.... all was DELICIOUS. The place has super cute outdoor space and they are dog friendly which is always great addition as that allows everyone to bring the most important member of their family.

***Pre-COVID*** Fun place to both people and dog watch, Pig beach is especially fun on the weekends when the young NY-ers come out en masse to drink and hang out with their friends in a trendy part of BK. The food is fairly good, although sometimes you're left eating standing up with your group until you can all squeeze into a picnic table and eat elbows in each other faces. I guess it's part of the charm - very modern brooklyn feels, with cute string lights and happy chatter all around. Would recommend the brisket, pretty well done and not too dry. Pork shoulder (at least the piece we had) was pretty dry and tasteless unfortunately. Seat and serve (utensils and tap water) yourself, first come first serve seating. Cute first date or family gathering place, potentially!

Went here with a big group of 11 around 5pm on a Sunday and while it was relatively busy, we were able to find a round table in the back that fit all of us. We ended up ordering food for the group and sharing and it was DELICIOUS. The ribs and the brisket were two of my favorites but quite honestly I thought all of the meats were cooked well and flavorful. We also tried the pull pork, the sausage with cheese, and the wings (moving this up to one of my favorites as well!) The bbq sauces were all distinct and tasty. I thought the original was great with everything. We got almost a full loaf of sliced bread because of the amount of our order. Mac and cheese breadcrumbs were goldfish (stealing that idea), fries were super well seasoned and crispy. Cornbread was fine, probably the least favorite for me but still decent and with all the other stellar food around it didn't really matter.

The monkey drink was also great. Place was spacious, food and drink were memorable, and service was quick. Will definitely be back again!

Pig Beach. Is. AWESOME.

- barbecue has tons of choices and is decently priced and tastes really good
- Got the brisket sandwich with Mac and cheese small side for $16, would recommend both items
- Went during November so not crazy crowded but bar is big and well-staffed and place is clean
- Good beer selection and overall environment
- This place lives up to the hype!

A hip spot for cool kids who like bbq food and drinking outdoors. The entrance leads to an outdoor area with tables, benches and two bars. When I came last summer, the place was so popping that navigating through the throngs of people and their dogs was almost as challenging as my first five road tests (I passed on my sixth try). My friend spent a good 40 minutes lining up to order a drink. And then my party spent another hour trying to place our food order indoors, which also has a seating area. It was slightly less crowded inside but still extremely loud. The four of us got the sample platter to share with one side of mac & cheese and one side of Coleslaw and sausage on top of that. The staff forgot our ribs, which turned out to be the best part of the meal! I'm usually a mac & cheese fiend but this one didn't spark joy. Honestly, we didn't stay too long after our meal because it was just not a good place to have a legit conversation.

The BEST barbecue I've had ever!! Although this place is definitely a bit of a trek from manhattan, it's totally worth it. My friend and I got the Mac & cheese, cornbread, brisket, ribs, and wings. The meat was perfectly cooked and juicy, even the next day after spending some time in the microwave!

Definitely a great spot to hang out with friends. We came on a Sunday, so they were playing some football games. I don't really follow the sport, but it was definitely easy and fun to get caught up in the vibe!

Such a great place! We went here for an early dinner on a Thursday - our first time going out to eat in 5 months!

It felt very social distanced and relaxing at the same time! Menus via QR code, food and drinks via counter service and big picnic tables to sit at.  You pick up your food order when your table is called.

We ordered pull pork and brisket sandwiches, Mac and cheese, and fries. We enjoyed all of it.

Service - The service is the same as any fast causal place that you can go to. You go to the register to order your food and you are given a buzzer to pick up your food when it is ready. Nothing out of the ordinary with a place this large.

Food:
Sampler Platter - Perfect for Two. My eyes are ALWAYS bigger than my stomach and I have become more indecisive the longer I look at a menu, so it is great that they curated a platter as a menu item instead of  making me choose a protein. Even though the menu says ""1/4 Rack Ribs, 1/4 lb of 3 meats"", the 3 Meats are already listed out for you on the menu onsite (Pork Shoulder, Brisket, Turkey). I would get this again with the side mentioned below!

Mac & Cheese w/ Goldfish - Creamy and nostalgic. This is some great mac & cheese. Shells are my favorite shape to cup the cheese. The addition give you a textural change when eating something so creamy! Two thumbs up like a bad dad joke.

On to the next food adventure...

As the summer winds down, made it a point to come here to enjoy the outside BBQ atmosphere while possible. Saturday late afternoon (sometime between the lunch and dinner crowds), still a significant line to enter.

Was able to get to the backyard area after about 10ish minutes in line. Place is generally packed both inside as well as outside - including a large portion ""Reserved"" for various parties. With nowhere to sit, opted instead to lean on one of the bars and order some drinks. The initial stall as you walk in has some cans, where I opted for an IPA ($8). Towards the back there is a bigger bar that I did not know had a better drink list. Inside, you can order food - settling on a Brisket Sandwich ($9) and some fries ($6 for a small). Meal comes out within a few short minutes - a small but dense sandwich packed with some brisket, fried onions, and pickles. Juicy and flavorful, but wishing there was more. Fries are fresh but completely over salted, which the beer couldn't whisk away.

The flaw here was coming on a Saturday afternoon; it is way too packed to enjoy a meal, even despite the bouncers regulating the crowd. May try again on a weeknight.

The smoked turkey was on point. Mac and cheese was superb. The bbq dipping sauces were also pretty dope, but completely unnecessary. The turkey was just that good.  Worth the trek.

Not pumped about the backyard bbq feel. It felt very cafeteria- like. And the beer was meh.

Tips:

Go for the food not the drinks or atmosphere. Next time I'll get take out.

Or go later in the evening to avoid the lines.

Great outdoor space for dogs and when the weather is nice! I'm originally from Texas so can be picky about my bbq. The food here is good, but not the best I've ever had. It definitely satisfies a bbq fix though!

We got the platter that had a sample of everything. The brisket, ribs, chicken, and turkey. Brisket was tender, ribs weren't as fall off of the bone as I would've liked, chicken was flavorful, and turkey was a good light option to balance it all out. All of their sauces are really good and pair well with the meats.

First off.
Omg omg.

The food was great. The brisket was soft as can be.  The Mac and cheese was great. They use crushed goldfish on top of the Mac and cheese. Omg.

The price was good. The drinks were great. The views were great.  The clientele was ehhh.  Come with a big party.

All in all 4.5 stars from me.  Brisket was on point.

Came here to watch an Ohio State game and were asked to leave at halftime to open up our table, despite other tables being open. What a terrible experience for an OSU game.

Solid spot! We got there early after Brooklyn 1/2 marathon and I'm so glad we did! It filled up quickly and by late afternoon it was so so packed. I loved how large the area is- there was inside seating and large picnic table area located out back/outside. A lot of puppies and babies, good mix of guys and girls of all ages and most importantly a lot of bus boys running around clearing tables. There was even a guy at one point directing the bathroom line when it was so long.... I liked the food options and selection although they are Grade Pending and last I saw they were rated a C. Yikes!

I tried to ignore that and the table ordered a bunch of things, from chicken sandwiches to wings and ALOT of fries. I thought prices were reasonable and would highly recommend for a large group, just get there early!

Do they have best bbq in Brooklyn? Probably not...

But I love the vibe of this place. Outdoor space, good selection of beer, dog friendly, (no vaping though).. Its perfect for a chilled crowd of 4 to 8 people.

We got the ribs, pork shoulder and brisket. The rub and seasoning were great, but the meat was on the dryer leaner side comparing to other top bbq joints.

The brisket and cheeseburger had little to no flavor, the beans tasted really good though. The sauce that came on the side for the brisket was good too.  The burger was the size of a slider.  Pretty disappointing based on how good they make their food look on the gram.  I'm given them 3 stars BC the guy who took my order was nice and seemed like he might've actually grew up in BK.

What a fun spot in Brooklyn! Pig Beach has a huge outdoor space with several bars to cater to patrons (beer, wine, cocktails, etc). There is also a spacious indoor area. It's a casual restaurant - order food at the counter and then grab a seat. Dogs are allowed in the outdoor dining area.

The bbq is great. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich, mac 'n cheese, and cornbread. I was happy with it all. My friends really loved the wings and pork shoulder.

The staff were all lovely. I stopped by on a Sunday evening where it was busy but not overly crowded. I'd definitely return.

Ahhh finally made it to the famous pig beach (in Brooklyn not the Bahamas lol)
Having heard so much about this place I was so excited to go. It seemed like everyone around me had tried the yummy food and raving about their Fros√®!

First let me start by saying I would have given it 5 stars, but I felt the drinks were overpriced ($14 a pop) and there were no specials particularly for it being a random Tuesday.
Please don't let that deter you, their frozen drinks were delicious. I had a fros√® and it was so refreshing (check out my pics to see the yumminess)

Now to the food! AMAZING! We shared a sample platter with a side of fries and Mac&cheese. The sample platter offered a little bit of everything, ribs, shoulder, brisket, turkey... sooo good and offered such great BBQ flavors! I have to mention the sides because the fries were the best I have had in a while. The Mac&cheese threw me off at first because it's topped with gold fish crackers but omg what a perfect and almost genius combo!

We will be going back for sure!

Great place for a birthday party. Came here on a Saturday for a friends birthday and the place was absolutely packed. There had to be at least five other birthdays going on as well as an ohio state football game. Lethal combo.

Great vibe, great food and nice people. There tends to form a line at the entrance so if your friend ya a name on the list, use that. Otherwise it moves fairly quickly.

There are only three potential things not to like about Pig Beach:

1. It gets crowded on nice weekend days, because you're not the only person that wants to eat delicious barbecue and drink in the sunshine at a beautiful venue that can fit all your friends. That's what everyone wants. If you don't like good places being crowded, move out of NYC. Or stop complaining.

2. It's not quite as cheap as you probably want it to be. That being said, you're a notorious tightwad, and the fact that you want them to be serving drinks at dive bar prices with the insane rent they are probably paying...it's laughable. Yes, cocktails are $14 at a barbecue joint, but the basil watermelon thing was delightful. Or you could just roll with a few of the beer/shot combos that come in at $12 and you can still get plenty drunk, you lush. (They also have an excellent selection of brews on tap.)

3. The BBQ sampler platter doesn't come with sides. But you know what it does come with? Lots of meat. For $35. And you can buy sides, and they are damn good. From mac and cheese to pickles to slaw, they are an excellent complement to the tasty ribs, brisket, pork shoulder, turkey (all on the sampler), wings, and sausage (add-ons that you should add on).

That's it. Those are all the things you could possibly not like about Pig Beach, and in reality they are things I don't like about you.

Otherwise, this place is about as glorious as it gets when it's sunny out and with the revamped indoor area, not too shabby when it's raining either.

I'll be there on the weekdays, so I can avoid you.

Went here with a friend to grab a bite to eat on a hot summer night. Getting in was pretty easy--no line at the door around 9pm on a Friday.

Then the luck continued at the ordering counter--literally we were able to order right away.

Then we grabbed a few drinks from the bar and found a spot outside to sit and the food buzzer rang--very quick!

We decided to split the sampler platter and a large side of cole slaw. The sampler platter had brisket, turkey, shoulder, and ribs. I would say that the brisket and shoulder were my favorite as they were the most tender. The ribs had good flavor, but not much meat on the bone overall. And the turkey was fine, but definitely much better when doused in BBQ sauce. I also really did enjoy the cole slaw as it was super refreshing and had great flavor.

We also had a rose cider and some sort of cucumber vodka drink, which were both decent as well.

Overall, this place has everything down to a science. The food is great--not the best BBQ ever, but pretty good--and the drinks are easy to order and decent as well. The drinks were a bit on the pricey side, but I guess for the ambiance and experience of eating outdoors, that's what you pay for. Nevertheless, we enjoyed our night out here and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for some tasty BBQ or a place to eat/drink outside.

Quick recap: if this place was simply a bbq joint, it gets 3 stars. Food is good but much better options for just bbq out there; however this place is so much more. Awesome spot to come and hang with friends at the bar or beer garden.

The bbq itself was good. The highlight being the brisket which was tender and juicy. Definitely the best thing I tried from the sampler. Also be warned, the chicken sandwich seems to have a small kick of heat to it.

However good or bad the food is, there's a beer garden here as well. So much open space, delicious cocktails, delicious beers. And live music at times, makes this spot so much more than just a bbq joint.

Service prices and cleanliness was all on point. Definitely a spot to check out and enjoy if you're in the area.

When the juice from the meat and the sauce run down your fingers and you lick your fingers and say wow at the first bite, you know you have a winner for a Burger. One of my ultimate comfort foods is a burger and I'm a little bit of a burger snob.

The signature Pig Beach burger topped w white american cheese,  secret sauce and pickles on a martin roll is just plain awesome! There's a reason these guys won burger bash 2019.

The meat is perfectly cooked and so tender to the bite. I easily could've had another one

Highly recommend  their burger. I had the double patty which is $11. The single is $8.

Excellent! Everything about Pig Beach reminds me of Texas - the outdoor seating, the barbeque, and the casual but fun vibes. It's a fun spot with great outdoor, communal seating space.

The line for food and subsequent preparation time were both short. On a Friday night, it was very busy, but it's still pretty easy to find room to sit outside. I tried the brisket sandwich, and it was delicious. I found the portion size to be a little small. The side of house pickles was good, but I wouldn't get it again. The sampler platter looked amazing and like it was a good value for two people to share. There is a good mix of beer and cocktail options at the bar, which is in a separate line from the drinks.

We had a really enjoyable experience at Pig Beach.  Is this place my absolute favorite BBQ spot in the New York?  No.  But they do serve up some solid 'cue in a hip environment!

Also, be aware that when you decide to dine may impact your overall experience.  We're not into big crowds, loud parties, or hanging around a bunch of drunks.  We went on a late Friday afternoon and were greeted by a bouncer who informed us that smoking and vaping is prohibited on the property (we neither frequent places with bouncers nor those that have explicit instructions re: smoking - so that was something new!).  The crowd was mixed.  Lots of families, dogs, and young and old alike.

We ordered the brisket (delicious), hot dog (pretty standard dog), wings (excellent flavor, but it was served room temperature - which is questionable), baked beans (yum), and French Fries (yes please!).

Overall, a solid time and well worth a visit.

I came here with a few friends yesterday and it was okay. The ambience is great, everyone's super friendly and chill, it's dog friendly which is great!

I wasn't impressed by the food, I ended up getting the brisket and I thought it was too dry. The French fries were okay, nothing special.

The have 3 different bbq sauces, thy were pretty good, considering I soaked them in my brisket.

The drinks were good, but overpriced for a place like this.

All in all an okay place .

I had been wanting to go to Pig Beach all summer and go figure I randomly end up making it in the Fall when the outside area is closed. I am almost certain that I came here before this place was called Pig Beach and it was another name. Anywho I had a pulled pork sandwich and brisket. It was good but I think it's fair to say that this place is overrated. I have heard so much hoopla about Pig Beach and I just don't think it met up to the superior expectation. Perhaps its the combination of food and outdoor space that people love but overall this place is just A-OK in my book.

This bbq spot was delicious. I shared the sampler platter and got a side of sausage Mac and cheese. Their bbq sauces are awesome they range from tangy to spicy. I am in love with their ribs. They Turkey was tasty and not dry. The brisket melted in your mouth.  The Mac of cheese could've been more cheesy but the crumbled gold fish crackers on top added the extra cheesy flavor. However, I loved the creaminess of it.
The sausage was good too and was stuffed with cheese.

The wait was not long at all it may have been about 5 mins on line with about 5 people ahead of us and the food was ready in 5 mins. There is a huge outdoor area which was packed like crazy but I was able to snagged seats for two quickly. They have two extensive bars one inside and one outside. Their cocktails were tasty and potent.

I definitely will come here again maybe earlier or another day of the week when it's not as crowded.

Great pulled pork sandwiches and drinks! The Mac and cheese side is not bad either. The brisket and wings were tougher than I'd like, but might have just been an off night.

Overall, food is a 3.5, but I'm bumping it up because of the large, dog friendly outdoor space with corn hole. This was perfect for hanging out during a weeknight. However, I'd avoid coming here during prime lunch / dinner hours on a weekend because it gets insanely packed.

Absolutely love this place. The only thing you can potentially complain about is wait times and over crowdedness if you come during peak times. But the place is huge and depending when you go can have 3 full bars open at once so you should be able to get drinks quick enough. The drinks themselves are good, nice variety. It's great that they have both indoor and outdoor space for people, and TVs for people who want to watch games, as well as cornhole for those who want to play them.

For me, this place gets 5 stars because of the food. My recommendation is to come with a group, order a bit of everything and just pig out (no pun intended). Their wings are deliciously saucy, and super juicy. Ribs are fall off the bone and heavenly. Nice touch to add gold fish to the Mac and cheese to add some flavor. Overall no food choice is a bad choice, so just try it all.

I brought my mom here because we both love good barbecue and I wanted to check this place out. We arrived in the early evening on a weekday so it wasn't crowded at all. Before ordering we had a beer at the bar inside and then headed over to place our orders. I had a burger, brisket, and baby back ribs. My mom ordered brisket, ribs, wings, and the mac and cheese with crumbled goldfish topping.

The burger was a bit on the small side but the flavor was outstanding! Seriously, one of the tastiest cheeseburgers I've ever eaten. I would go back just for the burger and order two of them. The brisket was juicy and the ribs were tender and delicious. I didn't even need any additional sauce on them.

My mom raved about the wings and she also loved the macaroni and cheese with goldfish. Cold beer + good barbecue= Happy Summer!

This BBQ joint is Bro and Basic central, calling all from Murray Hill and Fidi to day drink in this meat market.

If you own a Patagonia vest or only shop at madewell, this is your place. If that's not your style (me) but you still want the food, there's a nice little room to the right that is way more chill, and also family friendly. If I decide to pop in to get some smoked turkey, you'll find me there.

Pig Beach is nestled in Gowanus. I swung over after a rock climbing session @ BK Boulders. It was a Sunday night, yet the vibe was still lively and bustling.

The concept is like most BBQ joints... Pick your meats and order by the lb, with an ample open outdoor space. I was with three friends so ordered quite a bit. We went with the brisket, sausage, pulled pork, and a chicken sandwich. Out of all these orders, I found the chicken sandwich to be the tastiest. Granted, I did live in Dallas for a year+; this BBQ does not stand up to that level.

Overall, it's a great spot to chill with friends, grab a drink, and eat some decent BBQ. This 4* is largely due to vibe and interior.

Happy to find another gem that has an outdoor area with plenty of space to social distance all under a shade provided by a glorious tree. Drinks are easy / reasonable / refreshing.

Went to this place on a Wednesday night to meet with some coworkers. It's on a pretty busy block with plenty of bars and restaurants that are open for outdoor seating. Zombie hut has a large backyard patio that was fairly full with socially distanced tables, probably able to accommodate about 10ish parties at a time. I saw people with pizza and wings but didn't see a food menu so I'm now wondering if they allow outside food to be brought in, but if it was from zombie hut it looked pretty good.

The drinks: nice pours, tasty, and reasonably priced. I got the blue lagoon ($8) which was a blue margarita and it was very balanced but I could still taste the alcohol which I like. A friend got the frozen drink ($12) which he really liked. I definitely intend to return.

Ps: it's about 2 blocks from the F train Carroll st station. Plenty of street parking nearby. Device was nice enough but you do have to go inside to order. I would def return.

Last night I went to Zombie Hut per usual.  I entered with my service dog to find the usual response, ""no dogs"".  I told him it was a ""service dog"".  I got a blank stare.  I then repeated ""service dog"" and I got the same stare.  Then I said that I had ID and he asked to look at it.

I'd like to touch on the ID aspect.  It is illegal for an establishment to ask for ID.  I provide ID because I don't want to make a fuss.  There is no registry for service dogs.  Therefore, you never know what ID is real or faked /what dog has undergone training.  Anyways, if you don't believe me look it up.  It's illegal to ask for papers and there's no official service dog registry.

Post showing the bouncer my service dogs card (my service dog has undergone 200 hours of training FYI) I entered and saw the 3 bartenders ignoring patrons to take a round of shots.  We tried to order something and she said, ""1. It's going to be $10 and 2. We don't allow dogs.""

I kindly explained it was a ""service dog"".  The bartender said and I quote, ""are you sure it's not an emotional support dog?"" I said ""no... it's a SERVICE DOG"".  She then said, ""ARE YOU SURE?!"" They then demanded my papers.  I told them to check with the bouncer as he already checked them.  One bartender had to drag the other away because she was adamant that I was pretending I had a service dog.  She appeared to be immensely intoxicated as she was screaming and waving her hands at me.

She then went to the other bartender to (loudly) bad mouth me.  ""There is no way that is a service dog...that is absolutely an emotional support dog... that doesn't even look like a service dog"".  She was clearly thrown off by the fact that he was in a bag specially made for service dogs that holds him at my waist.  Ignorance is

I went back up to her and said the following.. ""How dare you, I have ears.  He is in a bag at my waste in order to preform his task.  Just because you are ignorant doesn't mean my dog is not a service dog.""  How INSULTING.

Management step up.

The Zombie Hut is a great find in this neighborhood of Brooklyn and the drinks are fantastic! Normally, I wouldn't order a frozen drink because they never seem to do the job, and I get throat/brain freeze! However, the Frozen Zombie is absolutely legit!! Lots of rum with orange and pineapple juice, perfectly blended, made me impressed! The ambiance is really cool here as well! There is ample
seating outside and it's like you're in a tiki hut!! When in the neighborhood, I know where I'll be going for another frozen drink!!

Stop #2 along the Smith street bar hopping tour. This place has all the things you need in a year round bar - indoor, inbetween, and outdoor seating.

The prices aren't too crazy and the blue hawaiin was strong and tasty. The decor for halloween was simple but perfect for Halloween. Need to come back here to see how different it is during regular season since it is a Zombie Hut.

Strangely wasn't crowded that one Friday we went, but I still admire the ambiance and decor of this place! It is definitely spooky, ominous (haha) and I think this place is perfect for a Halloween party.. all year round! I like the nice sitting area inside. I remember sitting next to a skeleton and that was cool, haha.

Drank this blue tequila based mixed drink here and it was delicious. I hope to come back.

Zombie hut. You kill me. In a good, rather great way. If you're in for a reliable dive bar, a quiet back yard, games at the bar, sweet cocktail kinda place take your brain to Zombie Hut.

It's been a staple of the hood for-evah and for good reason. It's consistent and WYSIWYG. No pretense. No trying to be hipster. No attitude. Just good neighborhood drinks with an always fun soundtrack.

Stop in, best served with another brainy friend, get a fishbowl and a few straws. You'll smile.

Wow, this spot is cool and unique. They have backyard that has a hawaiian vibe to it. It's so cute and cozy. The drinks are delicious too. It's a great place to come to if you just want to chat with your friends and feel the fresh air or if you wanna enjoy a romantic date. It's also a great place to bring a large party and have fun. Ideal to come here when the weather is good. They have a closed space too but I like the backyard better. I played it safe and had the margarita and it tasted strong and delicious like it should. Had a great and memorable time here. Will come again :)

I've gone to Zombie Hut for years. Yesterday was my first night at a bar since the beginning of the pandemic. We sat in the backyard and had a fair amount of space, but after spending over $200 on drinks, they asked us to move to a smaller table to accommodate another party. When they walked us to our new table, we saw that it was not 6 feet apart from neighboring tables. Overall, the waitress was rude. It's irresponsible to have tables on top of each other during a pandemic.

My new favorite bar ever! I love a good theme, and the Zombie Hut nails a theme I love- tiki! Zombie Hut features a classic tiki cocktail menu- Bahama Mama, Singapore Sling, Mai Tai! I had the Bahama Mama and the Singapore Sling- both were amazingly delicious. The drinks are affordable ($7) and strong!

The decor is also super fun! They have indoor seating and a patio/ courtyard out back. Visit this spot, you'll love it. If I lived in Brooklyn, I'd be here daily!

Had an afternoon date with a lad here after we both figured out we had obsessions with tiki bars.

Total tiki bar vibe. The place was quiet around 3pm on a rainy Saturday. We got two sits barside and were able to talk to each other calmy. The service was quick and non-intrusive.

The drinks were good. Good not great. Reminded me of drinks we made in college ourselves. But they're pretty strong so there's that. After around 2.5 rounds we began to feel a bit tipsy.

The decor is very tiki, but it's more dive tiki. And not in the charmy way Otto's is.There's something slightly off about this place. I was a bit disappointed.

I'll come back in the summer and check out the backyard. If you're in the area it's worth a visit. But I don't think it's necessary to travel out of the way to come here.

This place rocks! We stumbled in after looking around for a bar that has board games that we could hang out in before heading back to Manhattan.

The entry door to this place is also super cool, it looks like a tiki mask. We walk in and settled into a couple of comfy couches and were canoodling in the back. It's a very cozy atmosphere with cute tiki lights, up beat edm music playing, and relatively inexpensive drinks. We ordered the standard beers but the menu looked creative and tiki-tropical inspired. We will be back!

The good: no one really bothers you, fun place to have a conversation or catch up with friends/pregame, not much dancing but there is a fireplace in the back which could be fun!

4/5 stars because the smoke in the back room was super irritating to my eyes.

I loved the atmosphere at this bar and I would definitely return! Me and some friends went on a Saturday night for a few drinks and had a blast. Their beer selection is good and even though it wasn't packed most of the seats were filled but we still managed to find a spot. Apparently they have a fire pit in the back but we did not go back there.

This is NOT a chill come for a drink place, this is a drink to get drunk place.

""The server (olivia) was very uncompromising. A group of 18 professionals decided to provide the bar with some business before the weekend. We each ordered about 2-3 drinks each already. One individual was made a drink but was very unhappy about his order. When asked if he could change the drink he was shut down immediately. He was told he should give the drink to someone else because nothing can be done. I have never experienced this kind of treatment in any of the establishments I have frequented. Olivia was very rude""

She was extremely unwelcoming, used profanity when conversing with us, and even refused to switch the playlist to compliment the guest.

Please also, keep in mind that this isn't our first time visiting the establishment. We returned because our last experience was extremely warm, Fun and welcoming.

Please fix this.

I love the little Tiki vibe going on here. Combine that with some floral prints, fruity drinks, and bamboo things... ok, you can rock it Zombie.

Loves:
+ The theme, obviously
+ Good selection and dare I say budget-friendly drinks, with most $7-12 from my memory
+ A lightness in the air of being somewhere with such ~summery vibes~

The only downside I can really see is the cocktails here aren't as superior as some other joints in the area. But don't get me wrong, they are still good to decent. I would just say you are coming here for the fun vibes in addition to some dranks.

I love zombie hut. I've been going for years. You can always count on a good strong drink at a good price and a pretty chill environment. They don't serve food but you can bring your own food. The patio is really nice and they even have connect four in case your feeling a little competitive.

Kind of torn between two and three stars. You are greeted by a very cool exterior and entry door (check out the handle!) and upon entering see a kitchy decorated bar. The weeknight we visited there were only 2 others in the place. There were three of us, and opted for the Scorpion Bowl cocktail. You need to leave your drivers license at collateral m. Apparently there is a black market for mass produced ceramic punch bowls from China. The scorpion cocktail was made with rum, vodka rosa's lime juice (gasp! Not fresh squeezed limes???) and some sort of fructose sweetened drink mixer. There are Ben some sort of slushee machine drinks kind of like at Fat Tuesday. Having been exposed to the likes of the Mai Kai in Ft. Lauderdale, and Trader Sams in Orlando and Cali... this place pales in comparison. But heck if you want to visit a neat little Brooklyn dive and have a synthetically sweetened cocktail, it's not bad. They have a cool outdoor courtyard with bamboo palisade walls and a decent music track. Just don't expect craft cocktails here and you won't be disappointed. I think the bartender and staff were a bit unfriendly and underwhelming.

ROCK- PAPERS-SCISSORS... SHOOT!

The bartender set us up with a fierce round of rock-paper-scissors to pay the tab and as the winner I got into it with the bartender!  He won- we did a shot together.  Super nice guy!  He even remembers my friends who travel there a few times a year from Rhode Island!

As soon as you walk in it's warm and inviting!  I started to feel 'tropical' in Brooklyn in Late November!  It's clean and delivered me a fruity drink.  I was so comfortable I couldn't ask for anything more.  I like the vibe here!  I would go back for sure.

I left my card overnight, and they didn't charge me
Place gets crowded on a Friday
They get more extra stores for the games available
* altho, games don't have all the pieces

This used to be one of my favorite bars in the area. How can you hate on a tiki bar with fun cocktail swizzles of mermaids and stuff? A place that has tons of fun board games, heating lamps in an outdoor garden area? Easily. First, they've raised the prices by about $2-3 on everything over the years so that they may as well be a bar in lower Manhattan. Their drinks were always a little bit watered down to begin with, so that's insane. But the good news is that they have a wider variety of canned and bottled beer now.

Second crumby thing, they got rid of their bring in your own food policy and hired a grumpy ass bouncer. Now mind you, I was not the one to bring in the pizza pie to my friend's birthday this weekend. I honestly don't even know how they managed to sneak it in. But as I was finishing up my beer, my friends had all left for their respective cabs, and I was left with getting yelled at over the pizza. Btw, I didn't clean up the mess in the backyard that they left. Enjoy. They don't really have any real food for sale other than snacks, so I don't get why they turned into the mean kids in the school yard. I had fun until I was harassed by the staff and honestly don't see myself coming back any time soon.

I've been here so many times! It's in a convenient location for me. Close to work and close to home. So I manage to convince people to come here quite often. I even spent my last actual birthday night in the mid-week here chilling with some friends. They have a large backyard area that's open in the spring and summer and heated with lamps when its colder outside. Drinks are stupid strong. I highly recommend the frozen zombie and the planter's punch. If you have a group get one of their scorpion bowls that are lit on fire. They also have a huge amount of board games. My personal favorite, apples to apples! In the winter time the inside nook behind the bar has a fake heated fireplace. It's seasonal and fun. And who doesn't LOVE tiki drinks?! I do! Very reasonably priced for what you get as well. $5 for most of their cocktails. A few of the stronger ones are $7 or 8, but granted, they have like 3-4 shots of different kinds of booze in them. You can order in food. But beyond anything this place is full of fun.

My friends and I came here on a Saturday afternoon. There wasn't much people but the backyard was open! (YAY SUMMMMMERR)

The backyard is cozy but so is the inside. They offer a selection of games as well as decently priced alcohol.

They have BOWLS! Some of which you can keep for a price.

My favorite part of this place is that you can bring your own food - WINNIN'

After planning what should have been a fun happy hour we were met with a RUDE server! Olivia was very uncompromising. A group of 18 professionals decided to provide the bar with some business before the weekend. We each ordered about 2-3 drinks each already. A member of our group was made a drink but was very unhappy about his order. When asked if he could change the drink he was shut down IMMEDIATELY. He was told he should give the drink to someone else because nothing can be done. I have NEVER experienced this kind of treatment in any of the establishments I have frequented.

Simple review of a place with not much nostalgia, but is always fun and satisfying.  A tiki bar spot on a street full of places to go out, but it's different.  Very laid back spot and the drinks are amazing.  We've been about 5 times now and every bartender recommends a new drink to us and they are all wonderful.

You'll never see the place on TV or probably have another Brooklyn hipster do a magazine article about it, but I feel for some reason my next trek to Brooklyn will include a visit to the Zombie Hut.

Thanks

Interesting Spot

We spent a little time here on a night out hitting some bars in the area. It's not a fancy place, but it was fun. They have a little garden in the back (that still allows smoking!?) and that was a nice respite from the crowded interior. We shared a scorpion bowl and it tasted pretty good.

This is probably the kind of place you want to go after you've already had a few drinks.

Thanks

Such a cute little spot with a backyard in Brooklyn! The whole place is decorated with tiki decor and everyone is super friendly (including customers). And don't worry about bugs and mosquitos, they have buckets of insect repellent for you. For those of you who get bored easily or are unlucky and swiped right for the wrong guy or gal, there are board games to pass time. Don't forget about their special tropical drinks! Prices start at $7 and are very strong.

As for food? I recommend you eat before stopping by unless you consider hot pockets real food.

I'll be back to try their scorpion bowls!

I love tiki bars in theory but usually don't end up spending too much time in them. Zombie Hut looks the part and the decor is fun, but the drinks are far from great. Early on a Friday night, neither was the crowd yet: not much mingling or laughter, mainly 20 somethings talking among themselves and an apparently single dad who brought his kid :/ Oh Brooklyn.

Neither the Mai Tai or the Spicy Cucarita came in a tiki glass (maybe it's like Otto's and you have to put in a down payment, not sure, no one offered one to me). Not a huge deal, though that is part of the charm. The spicy drink was way, way too spicy, drowning out whatever taste of cucumber was supposed to be there. I love spicy drinks but this tasted like someone had made a mistake pouring in an ingredient. The Mai Tai was good. Music alternated between alternative to vaguely whiny pop.

They don't serve food, but don't allow you to order your own, so there's also that.

This place is great. Great vibes, perfect lighting (dark), and the drinks are amazing. Me and my gf tried the scorpion bowl and it hit the spot real quick. I definitely recommend this drink if you want to bring out the best fun version of yourself lol. The back of the place outside is great but it's more for a bigger group. If it's just you and your lady then i recommend sitting inside by the couches.

Came here post dinner in the neighborhood- pretty small but it was not to crowded when I arrived (8:30p).
Good selection of cocktails- I opted for the Skinny Colada (perfect after a super filling dinner) and a ton or interesting beers.
They have a bunch of board games that you can take to your table which is always a fun option- so we snagged a Connect 4 game and hung here for about 2 hours until it started to really fill up!

Very nice stylish, yet authentic tiki bar. Great decor and lighting-not divey at all. For me, the drinks were just okay. I tried the Mai Tai and Blue Hawaii and thought they were good, but nothing special. The recipes seemed to incorporate a lot of artificial flavors and sweetness. The Frozen Zombie was the best drink I had-sort of like a boozy rum Orange Julius.

Our bartender, Brandy, was fantastic. Great location on Smith Street. Recommended!

I go to places I like. Good drinks surrounded by good friends... how can you go wrong? Usually I stop in before and after a Gallery opening at MF Gallery. The alcohol probably tastes similar even if there isn't an opening to go to. Worth experimenting!

Came here on a warm night with former co-workers. I couldn't believe this bar was still around on popular Smith Street, but then I remembered how nice it was back then:

1. comfy although a bit divey and I love the red, floral lanterns at the bar;
2. good outdoor space for summer nights;
3. frozen tiki drinks galore!!!

It's been around for ages though, by ages I mean more than a decade. I don't know where it came from but there was a cheesy vibe in the room. Perhaps me and my partners-in-crime for the evening?

Or, perhaps the drinks weren't strong enough? I hadn't been here in years and unfortunately good bartenders don't stay put in one place for long. I remember the drinks I had many years ago were, in fact, a bit impotent but still tasted delicious.

The drink I had here the other night was not strong enough and not tasty enough to make me want to come back.

But I have a really great memory that happened here, so I'll give it another shot.

I have lived in the neighborhood for years and never went here until recently on a nightcap-needed whim. Once I got past the initial terrible smell, the atmosphere was chill and cozy!  My drink was good and well-price ($7 if I recall), I ordered some kind of sweet tea drink on the menu. The bartender was laid-back; not attentive, but that's ok by me; as I don't drink much. I would perhaps return again for an after-work drink... or probably just a nightcap.

This was my first time and I had a good time. When you walk in it just like a regular bar. Nothing nice or fancy. The have a selection of beers but the draw for me were the cocktails. The cocktail menu contains around 15 choices and I set out to try a few. Bartenders were friendly and ready to serve. The drinks were really good, had a kick and inexpensive. We got 6 cocktails and the total was $39. You can't beat that.
There isn't wait staff so you come in, find your spot and get your drinks at the bar. If the weather is nice there is a nice sized outdoor area. The tiki theme is really shown there.
There is a selection of games you can choose from to play with your drinking buddies such as jenga and connect 4.

The drinks here are cheap sure, but that's because they taste awful. Truly terrible. I've been shocked to see this bar on numerous ""best tiki bars in America"" lists, because while the ambiance and decor is 1950's tiki kitschy cool, I can't get over the nasty, artificial, convenience store drink mix taste of the drink I ordered. I've had better drinks at overpriced resorts in Mexico. Save your money. Get a beer and a shot any other bar on this block instead of ordering the toxic sludge that Zombie Hut calls a cocktail.

Pre-Covid, if you were looking for somewhere to unwind with friends after a long day, this place is it. While we didn't have a reservation, the wait wasn't too bad and we sat in Fort Greene Park about a block away.

Once we got in, we ordered a few small plates for the table. The beet hummus, whipped ricotta, and a special -- spicy hummus with small cubes of watermelon and cheese on top. Hands down the best hummus I've ever had in my life (with the beet hummus being a close second.) It was the perfect blend of refreshing, filling, lightness, good karma and then some. I still rave about it to people. My friends who grew up abroad eating hummus on a regular basis aren't normally impressed with the fad of different flavors of hummus. They call it ruining a perfectly good dish -- but then I took them to Miss Ada's and they were completely blown away and now are Miss Ada converts.

Recently got delivery again due to COVID, and was happy to have those memories of dining in flood back again -- same great service and food. I will continue to worship at the alter of Miss Ada. This stuff feeds your soul.

P.S. they have an amazing cocktail list, too.

Miss Ada is a special place. Pre-COVID, mid-COVID -- whatever angle you want to take, Miss Ada looks like a queen. This spot had been on my list for quite some time before I finally visited. I live on the UWS and rarely venture to Brooklyn, which is the primary reason I didn't come here sooner. Though had I lived in the neighborhood without knowledge of the NYC restaurant scene, I probably wouldn't have given Miss Ada a second glance. It's unassuming and fairly bare bones. But the product and hospitality coming out this place is as excellent as you'll find in the whole city. If you like Mediterranean fare, coming here is a no-brainer. You'll find elevated Israeli classics that are true to their roots with an added layer of creativity. It has adapted beautifully to the new COVID reality and remains a powerhouse in the scene.

Came to Miss Ada last Saturday night. We had an 8pm reservation, but weren't able to be seated until around 8:40. On some nights I'd be highly bothered, but the staff here made it all worth it. After we were waiting for about 10-15 minutes, the host brought us complimentary frozen drinks (a marg for the bf and a fros√© for moi) as a gesture of appreciation for our patience. Another 15 or so minutes went by and as we were finishing up our first round, the host scurried back and informed us that our table would be ready very soon but that he'd happily bring us a second round, on them, if we'd like. We declined but thanked him graciously. Truthfully, since COVID began, I haven't been able to just stand around socially and chat with a drink in hand, so the experience was refreshing (we were on the sidewalk, Miss Ada is still fully outdoors for COVID).

Once we were finally led to our table, the host assured us that he would comp some small plates for us, which he did. They really do value customer satisfaction here and the place overall is just so warm and welcoming. Part of why I wanted to come to Miss Ada was the famed backyard garden, which is as quaint and romantic as advertised. The tables are maybe a tiny bit too close together but not nearly as bad as what I've seen elsewhere. The setup is thoughtful and makes for a great dining experience.

While the frozen drinks were definitely the highlight cocktail-wise (though we also tried the lavender old-fashioned, which was yummy), the wine menu was also powerful in its own right. An emphasis on natural, biodynamic wines with a diverse selection of by-the-glass options. I've generally been hesitant to get into orange wines since my first few tastes in the past weren't to my liking, but I felt adventurous here and ordered a glass once our food started arriving. I was rewarded for my curiosity -- the wine was funky and earthy but not overpoweringly bold, just what I was in the mood for. Just take their advice here!

Now onto the main event. Truly magical food. The menu here is huge (even by pre-COVID standards), so it's really quite a challenge to deliberate. Sharing is recommended, encouraged, essentially mandatory, and should you not want to share maybe just take your business elsewhere? Sorry, I don't mean that. You'd just be silly not to want to try to cover every last crevice of this menu. The dips and kebabs are the royalty but it's all fair game. They're known for their za'atar-crusted salmon and their brick chicken entrees as well, but my recommendation is skip the mains, go the the littles. I'd say we covered good ground. Eats, below:

Whipped Ricotta w/ Brown Butter, Honey, Sage: A++
This is truly mind-blowing. I could forgo all dessert for the rest of my life and just eat this. Seriously heavenly, decadent perfection. Sweet, rich, creamy, all the good stuff.

Lamb Shawarma Hummus w Amba, Parsley: A++
It's clear why they're known for their dips here. Another unbelievable dish, served with pita but honestly you could easily just eat this straight. Rich, super flavorful and had me missing Israel.

Falafel w/ Feta, Olives, Green Tahini: A++
Okay, so speaking of Israel, the best falafel I've ever had was undoubtably there. But if you want my vote for the best *fancy* falafel, Miss Ada wins in a landslide. The perfect amount of crisp on the outside and the green tahini was just next-level tasty.

Salmon Belly kebab w/ Labne, Charmoula: A
Wasn't quick enough to get a picture before we dug in but this was fantastic. Melt-in-your mouth good. One of the smaller skewers on the menu so ordering this could enable you to try more dishes.

Short Rib w/ Red Cabbage, Israeli Mole: A+
Another perfectly seasoned, well-executed and varied dish. These kebabs are next-level and ideal for sharing. Great on their own, better in the mole.

Amazing food we got for takeout. I'd love to come back to dine in, but if not during covid, we will definitely be back for takeout or delivery soon.

The 3 for $25 deal is a great way to try multiple things. The whipped ricotta was my absolute favorite. The brown butter, honey, and sage were an amazing combo (I wish I could eat it every day). The babaganoush was just as good as all the other reviews say - highly recommend. The sweet potato humus wasn't a fav but it was good to try something different. These 3 small plates with the pita were enough to make two of us full for dinner!

The lamb shawarma was delicious and a pretty good portion size. The lamb was very tender and flavorful. The hanger steak entr√©e was hands down the best item we ordered. Cooked medium rare, it was so tender and even after our 15min walk home carrying the takeout, it was still so amazing. One of the best things we've eaten in a long time.

All servers were wearing masks from the outdoor dining we could see. Ordering online was very eaay and the website says how long orders should take before you order, and the order confirmation says the time to pick it up. Since our food was slightly (only a few min) delayed, the host offered us fros√©s while we waited, which was extremely nice. Best takeout experience we've had during covid.
Can't wait to come back!

If you have a taste for quality Mediterranean food this is the place to go
The service is great!!!
The drinks are amazing as well. The hotty toddy was by far my favorite. Reminded me of a nice lemon tea. But spiked.

The food at this place was incredible and the entire meal was very affordable. We ordered the Hummus (5/5), New York Strip (5/5), and the Hanger Steak (4/5). They provide ENDLESS warm pieces of Pita Bread with a large portion of delicious Hummus. The quality of the New York Strip was very good and the peppers and sauces that they used to garnish the plate with made the dish very flavorful. The hanger steak was also very good, but if I came back I would probably just have 2 orders of the New York Strip instead.

Unfortunately the service was very poor the night we went. Granted i've only been to this place once, so it could have been a fluke. That said, it took very long for us to get our food and the dishes were staggered very oddly. For example we got our hummus very quickly but after we finished we had to wait 25-30 minutes before we got  our next dish.

Overall I loved this place and will definitely be back.

Delicious, delicious, delicious! I have had the pleasure of traveling to the Mediterranean and I must say, this matches up to real authentic Mediterranean food. The food here is fresh and bursting with flavors. For drinks I had the ""Frose"" and a nice glass of red wine. The drinks were decadent and a perfect pairing with the food. We decided to skip entrees and order a bunch of small plates to share. We ordered the following:

Whipped Ricotta: Delicious, creamy whipped blend.
Babaganoush: Bursting with flavors.
Lamb Shawarma: Absolutely flavorful and well thought out.
Israeli Dumplings: A-mazing, the green sauce on top of it was to die for.
Albacore Tuna Skewer: This may have been my least favorite of everything because it was a tad bit on the dry side but the sauce it comes with makes it worth the while.
Kofta Kebab: The lamb was wrapped in a cinnamon stick. Ironically you do get a slight hint of cinnamon flavor as you bite into it.

The cherry on top was that the service was splendid. This place is really wonderful. I would highly suggest making a reservation as it visibly fills up quickly. Thank you Miss Ada!

I came here around a year ago for dine in, and the food was superb. The restaurant has reopened with outdoor dining recently, so I came here on a Saturday night and got take out.
The take out process is seamless and efficient. I ordered online before I arrived. On the receipt, it tells you that your order will be ready in 20 - 25 minutes.
When I arrived at Miss Ada, the food was already ready, and I got it in one minute after I got there.
I got the three appetizers for $25. These were the whipped ricotta with honey, muhammara, and sweet potato hummus. The sweet potato hummus and whipped ricotta were amazingly delicious, would highly recommend these. The muhammara I didn't like as much, I've had a really good version at another place.
I love the food here, and will definitely be coming to eat, and ordering more in future.

Nabbed a garden seating reservation for 3. We got the crispy cauliflower ($13). The breading on this was so crunchy and tasty and it paired perfectly with the slightly sweet sauce it came with. We also had the fall salad hummus ($13) which came with some fluffy pita. The squash, shiitake, and rosemary was a perfect earthy combo of toppings for the hummus. Next was the stracciatella ($16), a delicious, creamy chilled cheese soup with basil and tomato. The flavor was really delicate and light, probably my favorite dish of the meal. The shakshuka ($18) was probably the most underwhelming, too much cinnamon and slightly too salty. Also the meat eaters split the shawarma ($16) and the kofta kebab ($13) but I can't comment on that. They seemed to enjoy those a lot!

Service was super nice but made us order all our food at once. Also our table was very small (a 2 person table really) and they kept putting our dishes on the edges and corners of the table which made me nervous. Good thing we practically inhaled all our food to make room since it was (mostly) so good!

Lots of things can be made vegan!

COVID times assessment: make sure you get a reservation in advance. They release slots an hour in advance. It fills up. The garden is really nice if you can get a spot there. There is a 90 min limit on dinner and a 60 min limit on brunch.

We had a reservation for 2 people on a Saturday around 11a - it wasn't super crowded but every table was filled (note: some were definitely not socially-distanced safe; see pics).

Between 2, we ordered:
- the Hummus,
- the Baba Ganoush,
- the Shakshuka,
- a Coffee,
- and a Veridian.

Both the Hummus and the Shakshuka were extremely flavorful. The Baba Ganoush was great but pales in comparison to the other two dishes. They charge extra for pita bread but aren't upfront about it. The coffee was ok. The Veridian was light and refreshing.

Would definitely recommend trying the Hummus and would love to check out their back patio next time!

This is next level Mediterranean food
Would suggest making a reservation, since they tend to fill up their seating. The waiter informed us about the menu portion sizes since it was our first time visiting.
We ordered:
Whipped Ricotta - so good with pita, but also very filling
Lamb Shwarma Hummus - all hummus should have lamb. The spices make the dish so flavorful
Falafel - a little too bitter for my tastes, but perfectly crispy
1/2 Brick Chicken - a little too salty for some pieces, but the chicken breast were moist and not dry
Kofta Kebab - full of flavor and it reminded me of eating ground beef

;tldr can't go wrong with pita and hummus- their pita is so fluffy and we ended up ordering extra

Maybe the best delivery of all time? Miss Ada way exceeded expectations, even admist all the shutdowns and craziness.

We ordered the shawarma hummus, babaganoush, chicken schnitzel, and a bottle Da Mar Prosecco. We loved the Prosecco and it was super reasonable at $25. Overall, the meal was pretty pricey for takeout- but so so worth it. Everything was perfect and delicious. I really loved the babaganoush, it was probably one of the best I've ever had! The meal also came with 4 large, fresh, and fluffy pitas that made out meal complete.

If you're thinking about ordering from here - definitely do it! It would also be fun to order pickup and enjoy in nearby Fort Greene Park...

The food and drinks here are so good. I got the Israeli dumplings which were my favorite- crispy and flavorful and filling. Followed by the crusted salmon which was perfectly cooked and beautifully presented. I got the daiquiri which was subtle and refreshing and not overpowering like some cocktails can be at other places. Service was great, we sat outside which was covered. I will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu because it's a big menu with a lot of delicious sounding items on it :)

Have been wanting to go to this place for a while now and finally bit the bullet and came on a sunday evening with my girlfriend. While there was a 30 minute wait since we didn't have a reservation, we happily walked nextdoor to a cute little wine barto wait (even if you don't have to wait, I highly recommend stopping here anyway, very refreshing wine selection).

We started with the hummus platter, which was fantastic. Super creamy, very flavorful. I think my girlfriend and I would have licked the plate clean if there was no one around. Next we went with the octopus, which I have to say has been my favorite I've ever had. perfectly cooked, paired with these delicious peppers that give it just a little kick. The portion was also very very generous. I could have eaten this again for my entre as well if I didn't have a need to try as much as possible.  We finished the evening with the salmon, which again I cannot say enough good things about. The flavors were just incredible. You have to try and get a little piece of everything on the dish in a bite, highly recommend. We also had a very refreshing cocktail to go with dinner, the veridian, which like everything that night was made with such care and high quality. Well done.

Quarantine takeout review:

Ordered an incredible spread for Friday night, including:
- 3 small plates for $25: babaganoush 4.5/5, sweet potato hummus 4.5/5, and muhammara 5/5
- 1 whipped ricotta $10 5/5 (would give this 6/5 stars really, it's - incredible)
- salmon belly crudo $14 (4.5/5)
-zaatar crusted salmon $25 (3.5/5)
- crudit√©s $4 (1/5)
- tres leches cake $7 (3/5)

We also ordered the Dead Sea cocktails (5/5), they were super delicious and much better than what we were expecting from to-go cocktails.

Biggest takeaways: stick with the dips, get all the ricotta, order some extra pita and cocktails and call it a successful night.

I've heard so much hype about Miss Ada, and was finally able to score a  brunch reservation for me and 3 friends.

I have to say that there were a couple of outstanding dishes:
1. whipped ricotta (5/5)
2. malawach (4.5/5)

I absolutely love whipped ricotta and have had my fair share and this one really shone (other notable mentions are Misi's whipped ricotta toast and Olea's whipped ricotta).

The rest of the items were good and the pita was fresh, but comparable to other good israeli places in the city.

Only con was the waitress was a bit condescending to us, which put a slight sour note on the whole experience.

Looking for an affordable next-level Michelin star Mediterranean food with amazing service? You have to try Miss Ada. My friend and I were blown away by how delicious the food was. We tried multiple dips, pita bread,falafel and my friend also tried a skewer.
classic hummus
whipped ricotta with brown butter, honey . This is so unique and incredible, definitely a must!
Muhammara - red pepper hummus this was my fave though. The cumin hit the spot and loved all the other flavors
babaghanoush- this was my friend's fave. Loved the eggplant was perfectly pur√©ed
Labneh- too many times garlic overpowers other flavors but not at Miss ada. Perfect balance.
falafel - this was lightly fried and crispy. There was no hint of oil and I like that.
Pita bread was fluffy and warm. Our server and our homegirl Marianela made sure we had a good experience. The wait is long here coz of limited seating but worth making a trip to Brooklyn

My Al fresco dining experience at Miss Ada was excellent. We tried the Lamb Shawarma hummus, short rib kebab, and Hangar steak- all of which were excellent. Service was friendly and attentive, even on a busy Thursday night. I look forward to going back!

This was my absolute favorite meal in such a long time. Came here with three girlfriends and ordered several items to share. First of all, ambience! It's intimate & cozy, inviting, dimly lit with a view of the kitchen. It warmly says ""come inside. good things are here"". Even the bathroom located in the basement level carries the cozy attention to detail.

The food. Oh my word everything was SO good. From the hummus to babghanoush, and all of the other items that are escaping me right now. Each dish exploded with flavor. The cocktails were delicious and creative. I started with the Lavender  Old Fashioned and finished with the cucumber mezcal drink. Everything was so perfect.

I'm not huge on dessert and don't quite recall the two we shared, but they were good enough. Can't wait to come back.

The chicken liver bowl is to die for. Hands down the most delicious poultry infused dip of any sort. Alone is worth the trip. You're welcome.

I wanted to go down the list from best dish to most ok- good dish but 2nd most impressive thing about Miss Ada wasn't a dish. It was the romantic, effervescent, easy and sophisticated atmosphere. You just got to go to know it for yourself.

3rd- we enjoyed their cumin shashuka thoroughly as something we've never had but are now so motivated to  replicate on our own.

3rd- actually, it's a tie between the shashuka and their cocktails. Their bourbon orange egg white and Dead Sea cocktails were pretty on-point.

4th- the whipped ricotta was a very good starter w warmed pillowy wheat pita.

Then, we have the less than perfect but still yummies: lamb shawarma, octopus (too salty) and kunefe dessert- best hot but once cooled we can sorta tell this wasn't a made to order thing. Decent lavender cardamom flavors tho.

All said, we were happily and thoroughly patronized at this super low key, stylish and exciting restaurant and cannot wait to return.

Honestly amazing food but a few things that bothered me:

1. potions are absolutely tiny and each skewer order is just one skewer for $15??
2. you have to go at 5:30 and lineup or no shot you're getting in without a wait
3. expensive and small portions

But the ricotta honey is absolutely insane. A the red pepper hummus is absolutely insane. Chill vibe good date spot.

We came back to Miss Ada a few weeks ago. We came earlier in evening and was able to grab a table this time. It was a lot more comfortable.

We ordered a bunch of enjoyable dips. The sweet potato, the veggie, baba. All were amazingly flavorful and addicting.  We also order two short rib skewers and a shawarma hummus which was on the salty side.  Everything though is great with the warm pita.

I def enjoyed this visit better and love the food here. The staff is pleasant. A table is def the way to go.

We were in the mood for Mediterranean and I saw Miss Ada on yelp. I tried getting reservations for a whole week with no avail. I called and the hostess on the phone, she said to come in there shouldn't be a problem getting a table at that time. The longest we would have to wait is 30 mins. Well not to bad I thought, right? We show up walk in and the restaurant is packed.  We ask the hostess how long and she tells us 2 hours but the bar is about 15 mins. I mean, I guess okay.. Repeat with me.. Bars are for drinks, Tables are for food! At least that is the case here, because they added an extra 4 bar stools to this bar so you can't really lift your arms to eat anything or sit properly!!  The restaurant is cute but small. There isn't a area to wait for your table/bar stool.  Where ever you stand you are in the way of a server or on top of a table that is eating. Also, There is suppose to be a garden dining area but it looks like they are not using it anymore.

We were finally seated at the corner of the bar. A very awkward seating arrangement. Remember I told you about those extra seats, well we were the lucky winners to get them! Our legs were entangled and we were both trying to figure out how they would fit our food on this small amount of space in front of us.  Plus we had some immature, obnoxious drunk couple to the right annoying us through out dinner.  Moving along...

We looked at the menu and decided on a few dips, apps and a entree.

The dips we ordered were Babaganoush, which is a roasted eggplant dip. it was smooth and creamy. It had a ginger aioli which made it so special. It was absolutely delicious. We also had the ricotta with brown butter, honey and sage. Which also was super creamy and amazing. Another great dip to try. Our last dip was an Israeli salad hummus. It was roasted veggies on top of a classic chickpea hummus. it was also extremely tasty. All dips come with freshly made hot pita.

For an app we ordered falafel which came in lettuce leaves. It was three to an order. It had olive and a green tahini dressing. This was def an interesting take on falafel. It was moist and seasoned beautifully.  This app is for one person not to share!

For an entree we had the hanger steak-medium.  It also came with a succotash and peppers.  The steak came under done more of a rare and a little over seasoned.  The dish overall was good, it just needed to be refined a bit.

The food at Miss Adas especially the dips are especially delicious.  The staff here is very nice and try to please..  After saying that, There are a lot of mishaps that go on with seating mainly bc they don't have a waiting area. A group of two adults and a child walked in and invaded our space while we were eating in our already small cramped area at the bar during dinner. Staff consistently told them they couldn't sit or stand in the bar area. That it was reserved. They ignored them, squished and bullied there way into the small two person area with the small child on the left side of where we were seated. After 10mins of not getting their way they got the hint to leave. Or maybe it was because they told them enough times someone was coming for those seats. The bartender apologized to us for the issue.

I would only come here if I had solid reservations for a table. If we didn't have issues with our seating I would had given Miss Ada 4 stars. There were so many issues that made us feel so uncomfortable here.  Maybe they should fix the lay out and give a waiting area. Also, take out some bar stools so patrons can feel comfortable while eating there dinner at the bar.

Parking is a tad difficult (321)

On a short trip to New York, this was one of my friend's few recommendations, and Miss Ada did not disappoint!

THE WAIT: Four of us came here at 6:00 p.m. on a Friday. It was already packed, but luckily we were sat right away at a three-seater corner booth (so it was a bit tight, but we took it anyway). We could have sat outside where it was heated, or waited a couple hours for a table inside.

THE SERVICE: They were very busy but our server was friendly and our food came at a good pace!

THE COST: $260.20 before tips for a very filling dinner for four.

MUST-HAVES: Chicken Liver Hummus, NY Steak Skewers, Salmon Skewers, Octopus (the most tender I have ever had!).

See my photos for additional details!

More like 4.5 but I'll give it the full 5 since yolo.

The only reason this isn't a guaranteed 5 star is portion size and attitude.
--portion size - thought it was like 3 skewers per order. It was 1 each! Bug out.
--attitude - little snotty at the door. Showed up 20 min before they opened and was not very warmly received. ""Hype place"" attitude I call it

NOW for the good part - we got 4 dips and 4 skewers and 4 falafel.

Dips:
Ricotta honey - unbelievable
Labne - amazing
Muhammara - incredible

Falafel - amazing

Skewers:
Short rib - incredible.
Halloumi - amazing.
Sirloin steak - great.
Salmon - very good.

Honestly the food was exceptional. For a grading scale, see below:

""Unbelievable"" - 9.5/10
""Incredible"" - 9.4/10
""Amazing"" - 9.2/10
""Great"" - 8.2/10
""Very good"" - 7.8/10

Highly highly recommend. Reservations seem tough and even getting there 20 min early it filled up right on the dot at 530 when it opened. But clearly with good reason....

This place is one of my favorite Mediterranean spots in NY- I don't get out to this area of Brooklyn as often, but when I am- I always go! Such fresh ingredients, you'll feel light & satisfied & full at the same time! The merguez hummus is so yummy & the market salad is huge & full of all the veggies that will make you feel so good :) I adore this place & the vibe is so cozy & inviting! Oh- get the Dead Sea cocktail. Obsessed. Won't regret the trek here - worth the extra trip to Bk!

Holy moly. There have been very few restaurants that have left me speechless and this is one of them. The hummus/dips are to die for. I think I even sat there in awe for a moment as I had my first bite of warm pita with each accompaniment.

We ordered the sweet potato hummus and whipped ricotta and WOW. It's difficult to even describe how delicious each of them were. The sweet potato hummus was a perfect combination of slightly sweet and smoky while the whipped ricotta was a literal dream--the sweetness alongside the slightest bit of saltiness was complex and had a beautiful depth to its flavor. I cannot rave about these two dishes enough.

We also had the Sabich and Malawach. The sabich was very good, but not as stellar as our small plates. I would probably opt for something else if I went again. The Malawach, on the other hand, was so amazing and flaky. Also, my boyfriend said that this was the only place he was able to find it this far.

Incredible restaurant, very nice people, beautiful atmosphere. They were very accommodating to our large group and I cannot wait to go back!

Come for the dips, leave having dessert!

The babaganoush is a familiar texture but the taste and spices are uniquely delish, the fried eggplant chip is a nice touch!  The labne surprisingly wasn't that special, but the whipped ricotta - I was eating it with a spoon. I do agree with another reviewer that more honey would make it consistently amazing. The chicken liver hummus Masabaha was rich, filling, and satisfying.  The pita that's served us warm, thick, and filling. Ordered veggies which was radishes, carrots and romaine - went perfect with the whipped ricotta and labne!

Short rib and haloumi skewers didn't disappoint, def liked the pickles, cabbage, and jalape√±os that came with.

Got a special salad with baby kale, herbs, apples, plums and walnuts that was a perfect addition to all the dips. Miss ada fun cake was described like a tres leches but with cardamom and spice - was on the sweet side but the spices, salted caramel and honeycomb on top added texture and flavor.

Next will be brunch!

Before I came here, I was wary of some of the reviews detailing poor customer service and a rushed dining experience. I'm a firm believer in making your own opinion from your own experience though so I had to try it. I must say I was impressed and delighted at how amazing everything was!

I came here with a friend and we did not make a reservation. There was about a 30 minute wait on a Tuesday evening, so we walked around and looked in some of the shops down the street. The space is very narrow so on a full night there isn't really anywhere to wait inside.

My friend and I were seated at the bar,  which if you have bags and jackets with you like we did, can be a bit cramped. However the bartender still provided us with attentive service (he wasn't going anywhere and there are only so many seats at the bar), even though we did have a bit of a time fitting all our plates in front of us when they came. It seemed like everything we ordered magically appeared in front of us mere moments after we ordered it, but it felt like a moment of instant gratification rather than feeling rushed to eat and leave.

The food:
We ordered several small plates and two desserts. If you're eating out with a friend or two, I think that's the only way to do it, as some of the dishes are very rich and can be a lot for one person to tackle on their own. The whipped ricotta and honey was divine on their fluffy warm pita! We couldn't get enough of the fresh bread so we must have ordered extra three times (I think after a while the bartender stopped charging us for each order haha). The baba ganoush was tangy and well spiced! The Lima bean hummus (they had a few different varieties to choose from) was silky and smooth. And my favorite - the crispy cauliflower shawarma - was to die for! I am going to have to come back here once a month just to get an order of this for myself. It was the only thing I didn't want to share with my friend! The outside was crispy and crunchy with a soft yet firm inside. The flavor was smoky with a bit of spice and a sweet drizzle of honey. I will undoubtedly try and fail to replicate this at home. Finally, the two desserts we got were so decadent yet light. The fun cake was moist and sweet, like a tres leches cake, but the bits of honeycomb on top really added a nice bit of texture and sticky sweetness. The kanafeh was a delightful juxtaposition of textures and flavors, combining the crispy airiness of the kadaif with the smooth base of sweetened goat cheese served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Now I am absolutely not a goat cheese fan but this dessert was delicious and not too heavy if you're looking for a sweet way to finish your meal without bursting at the seams.

10/10 would recommend and I cannot wait to go here again soon!

We're spoiled in New York. There are lots of great restaurants out there where one can dine out in any country at any time of day or night. Sometimes it's magical. Sometimes there's a lot of hype around a restaurant and that restaurant lives up to or even exceeds that reputation. Sometimes, it's just dinner.

We arrived 5 minutes before our reservation and stood cramped in the entry area for 20 minutes waiting for our table while a table for two remained empty for the duration of our meal. There was some confusion as we were finally sat about who our server was; we were asked every 2 to 3 minutes by different people if we were ready to order within 2 minutes of sitting.  We aren't slow. We thought it was just attentive service with a bit of a misstep: it isn't. They want you in, they want you out, they want you gone.

The menu feels a little like a baby food buffet - 10 different kinds of pureed dips...do you really need sweet potato, carrot, beet and 3 different kinds of hummus on one menu when the only solid food is octopus (tiny) and cauliflower (very good)? AND also whipped ricotta and fava bean puree? Check your teeth at the door people - you won't need them for 90% of the small plates on this menu. It was tough to come up with a good well-rounded dinner on that basis, especially if you don't want to sop it all up with pita (which was again excellent, but it woke me at 520 am the next day like a giant rock in my stomach).

Cocktails were watery and very slow in arriving. In fact, the first onslaught of dishes came before our drinks. And then...BAM here's 4 plates of food all at once. They said plates would arrive when they arrive (like most places) but unlike places that care, they did nothing to pace the meal...a dish or two now, then the next 10 minutes later, etc. 4 at the exact same time, all warm dishes. It really rushed us in a way that was seriously unpleasant.

Baba Ganoush and cauliflower were very good. Hummus was good but no different from all the other israeli places that have gotten the right method down. Halloumi was ho-hum. Hanger steak was very good and well cooked.

Wait staff made it clear they don't want you to eat dessert - they just want you out, out, out I say! to get the next slackers in for their set.

Dining out is precious for us. It's a luxury and we want it to be a bit of an experience when we go. We have kids and busy lives like lots of people. We had free babysitting tonight and wanted a fun, relaxing meal to share. This wasn't it. The food was fine (albeit with a menu that absolutely lacks innovation, invention, variety or fun), the drinks were subpar (pretty in the glass but watery and slow to arrive), but sometimes it really is the rushed service that leaves a diner cold.

Slow down, Miss Ada. You move too fast. Give us a moment to enjoy what you do have to offer, and revisit your 90% puree menu. We have teeth and like to use them, sometimes for something other than meat, too!

I wanted to be blown away by Miss Ada. I was mentally drafting a five star review as soon as I sat down, actually more like days before I even got here. I thoroughly stalked Miss Ada's menu, pictures, reviews, and website several times prior to my visit, as I do with many other hot restaurants generating buzz around town. I know, get a life, weirdo. But really, I even knew basically exactly what I was going to order by the time I was finally able to score a weekend reservation. My dreams and sky high expectations were simply not met.

First item I decided I had to try was the whipped ricotta. Although I did get a couple of perfect, satisfying bites worth savoring, I was left wishing the honey would have been drizzled on more generously or mixed into the entire dip - once you exhaust the top layer, this dish is really not all that exciting.

The item I was looking forward to the most was the chicken liver and caramelized onion hummus - that description alone just screamed of flavor to me, but alas, the flavor was just not quite there. So much so, that I actually committed the ultimate faux pas, the equivalent of a slap to a chef's face - that's right, I dared asked for salt, which helped slightly, but not enough to give it the wow factor I expected.

As for the kofta kabob, I did appreciate the beautiful plating and the innovative use of cinnamon bark as the skewer, but looks alone will only got you so far in this world, sweetie. The meat itself lacked flavor and was honestly quite boring. Not the best use of my $13.

Lastly, I indulged in the snapper crudo, one of that day's specials. This was by far the most flavorful dish, thanks to the lemony sauce loaded with fresh jalape√±os and dill. At this point, I was way too grateful for the almost overwhelming acidity and flavor that other dishes were missing.

Now look, nothing I ate at Miss Ada was terrible, nothing was even bad, but nothing lit up my palette with fireworks either. The above mentioned four dishes were also way too much food for my boyfriend and I to split, despite our waitress raising her eyebrow at us and claiming that was going to be light order. However, for a restaurant with such a cult following and high demand, I once again do not see what all the fuss is about. I am not afraid to revolt against the masses and say it - much ado about nothing here at Miss Ada.

Food was delicious. We got a table in their garden, which is a super nice space. Got the baba, lamb shwarma, octopus, and hangar steak, all which were delicious. I was very impressed by the steak, which we ordered after reading some other reviews.

The only downside was that they really really wanted us to leave in our designated window, even though we were seated late. They mention a few times on their menu that we only have 90 mins, the server mentioned this at the beginning and tried constantly to take our order within 5-10 minutes of sitting down. They also came up to us ~15 mins before our 90 min window finished and suddenly came up to us and asked ""how would you like to pay, with one credit or two?"" even before we were done with our meal or saw/brought the check! I get it - times are extremely tough and they need to keep a steady turnover. But it took a little away from the experience to feel so rushed.

I really enjoyed this, particularly the dips -- the sweet potato, baba, muhammara, and whipped ricotta were all amazing. I was less crazy about the beets and fava bean hummus (although I'd like to give the lamb schwarma hummus a shot). We also got the octopus, half brick chicken, a special steak skewer, and falafel, and the only one of those that we really liked was the octopus.

Next time, those first few dips are must re-orders, and I'd like to explore the hummus a bit more.

Came here without reservations on a Friday night. The wait was 40 minutes so we decided to sit at the bar.

We ordered 2 cocktails, an appetizer (the spicy hummus) and each had the salmon with eggplant as an entree.

The hummus came out before the drinks did and it was really good, probably the highlight of our meal.

20 minutes later and still no drinks (the bartender was slammed and there didn't seem to be a bar-back helping him).

Our entrees arrived and we were disappointed to see the $27 per-plate salmon alongside just two-bite-size pieces of eggplant and the remaining plate supplemented with roasted onions (which honestly didn't compliment the flavors of the salmon whatsoever, so I'm wondering if they were out of eggplants and just threw in the cheapest veggie they had on hand)?

Our drinks finally arrived when we were about halfway done with our meal (womp womp).

We finished with the chocolate brownie with ice cream which was good but nothing to be impressed about.

Unfortunately our experience was lackluster and I don't expect we'll be back, despite living only a few blocks down.

I live very close and never knew this place was there! It's easy to walk right by if you don't know to look.

There is seating indoors and a really cute patio out back. I suggest eating out there if the weather is nice.

My boyfriend and I walked in on a Sunday evening and there was no wait.

All of their wines are natural. And they even had a gamay on the wine list!

Everything we ordered was amazing! We had the whipped ricotta, lamb shawarma hummus, brick chicken and za'atar crusted salmon. I'm still thinking about the warm pita bread they served surf the ricotta and hummus.

I 100% recommend this place!

Miss Ada could've easily been a 5-star meal if not for a few slip ups. We came in on a Saturday night and it was pretty crowded. We ordered the lamb hummus and baba ganoush to start and both were absolutely perfect. I would love to come back just for those two dishes. However, they came out within five minutes of us ordering. Like, I went to the bathroom and by the time I came back they were already out. Fine, but the meal's cadence continued to be off.

The busser took our empty plates away and we got our next course immediately, a halloumi skewer and a short rib skewer. These were also really good but we were starting to get super full since it was 15 minutes into the meal and they had already served us almost everything.

Our final course was the falafel and the kale salad, both of which were sub-par in all of our opinions. When I bit into the falafel I could literally only taste cilantro, which I hate and it wasn't advertised on the menu. I couldn't eat it. Both of my friends do like cilantro, though, and said it wasn't very good anyway. The kale salad was WAY overdressed with huge stalks of raw broccoli that were almost impossible to eat. It had tons of raw onion in it, also not stated on the menu, which always ruins any dish for me. So unnecessarily sharp tasting and overpowers every dish. At the very least it should've been on the menu so I could've asked for the salad without it.

After finishing this last course we were about a half-hour into the meal and waited 20 minutes for the check. I don't mind waiting but why rush everything in the beginning only to forget about us in the end? Finally the waitress came by and gave us our check - no mention of dessert. We saw their dessert menu online and were excited to order from it but it was obvious our time was up (50 minutes after arriving) and there would be no sweet end to the meal.

I still would come back but would likely just stick to the small plates which were absolutely delicious.

We've been multiple times for dinner and recently went for brunch. Really fantastic meals each time.

The High Notes:
- MUST order the whipped ricotta with honey. Do not question this. Just do it.
- Babaganoush dip is also wonderful and a nice way to balance the sweet whipped ricotta
- Pita is great and plentiful, we're often pretty full from two dips and pita alone
- The variety of kebabs haven't let us down yet
- Very cute spot with a nice garden in the back
- Fair price for what you get in flavor, satiety, and environment

Other Notes:
- There is a separate section on the patio that is pretty cramped, right in the sun, and the plants are all over you depending on your seat. Just don't grab this table on a hot day and you're golden.
- The food comes out SO fast. Which can be great if you are starving, but I usually appreciate a little spacing to enjoy the experience a bit more. Meals feel a bit rushed here.

Get a reservation if you can, but if you can't they do try to take walk-ins and so far we've been lucky and were seated almost right away.

Will keep coming back, excited to try more of the menu!

Came here for a brunch with a group of friends and was impressed by the quality of dishes that came out. I think the lamb shawarma was definitely the best of the bunch and a must order!

Only complaint is that the dishes didn't come out together and we got some of our spreads towards the end of the meal.

Absolutely blown away by the service here. The best I have ever experienced in a restaurant, laid back but attentive and warm. The food was perfect from the appetizers down to dessert. This restaurant was a joy to dine at!  I loved the fried cauliflower, falafel, labne,  baba ganoush and babka P. S. I hope you're tipping over 20% if you eat out during a pandemic.

Stopped by this Brooklyn institution this week for their 14th ( 14th!! ) anniversary.  What a great night.  Have not had the pleasure to be here since COVID closed so many of our favorite bars.  Epic draft list and safely managed social distancing.   Do be sure to check out their roadway seating annex - it reminded me of day drinking on the Champs - Elysees in my younger days.   Bring your best girl and make a day / night of it.  You'll be glad you did.

My best girl and I took our two angel-faces to Brooklyn - YES, that Brooklyn - to see Disney on Ice at the Barclay's Center.  After the performance, and what a performance it was, we made our way over to the 4th Avenue Pub.  What a great way to end the day!  We sat outside in their lovely garden on a beautiful Brooklyn evening.  They offered beers from all over the world, including some beers brewed right here in New York City.  If you ever find yourself in this section of Brooklyn, stop by for a great selection of beers served by a knowledgeable and caring staff.  You'll be glad you did.

I'm an avid popcorn lover and it's free! Free! Free! At this pub!

It's super cool and casual atmosphere, it seems small when you enter but has a lot of space sm seating on the inside as well as additional seating to the back on the outside.

There's a bay seasoning that you can add to your popcorn for a bit of diff flavoring. Music is at the right level where you can carry on a conversation without shouting. And there is a wide selection of beer and varying alcoholic beverages .

This is definitely a place to hang out at and it's in one of my favorite neighborhoods.

Will be back.

Wanted to like this place but had to leave before ordering anything. From the website and list they have tons of beer. Belgians seem specialty but draft list is large as well. We were feeling IPA and literally each of the 2 on draft and one in can we're gone. Good for macro selection but need to update the menu. Poor business when you don't have beers actively advertised on website and menu and even on chalkboard behind bar but can't deliver. Beers themselves sit at $7-10 it seemed.

FREE OLD BAY POPCORN!  What more do you need to read?  Are you kidding me! Stop reading this and just GO THERE!

As if the popcorn wasn't enough...this cozy little watering hole also has a fantastic beer selection.  The staff are engaging and friendly and know their beer stuff. There's also a nice outdoor seating area.

Are you still reading this?!  Jesus Christ, I need you to do better!  Go have a beer!  If you see me there...1st round is on me!

The bartender is super friendly here. They have free refills on soda. They also have free popcorn, which is nice. But someone noticed that someone stuck his hand in to get the popcorn instead of using the scooper so he decided to not get any more popcorn for our table. Always tip your bartender!

Props to the bartender-ess. Came here on a vfriday evening for a friends work happy hour. There ended up being 20 of us in the party, and probably another handful of people in the bar. They do not have pickle juice, which was my biggest turn off, no rounds of pickle backs for us. Bartender was so kind and handled the large group well! They have an adorable low key back patio area with lights and picnic tables. I was genuinely surprised They only staffed one person for a Friday night but I guess I don't know the area. The drinks are strong and cheap. No food. Good neighborhood spot if you're looking to get lit. Sign said open til 4am

Looks tiny from the door, but it has a decent amount of space as you move closer to the back.

I had rose as I'm not a big fan of beer. Note: if you LOVE beer this might be a cool place to try.

The interior is standard dive bar and the staff are dive bar attendee friendly.

Overall I'd come back here for a quick late night drink.

Let me repeat: Great beer selection, free popcorn, and outdoor seating.
Do I need to even keep writing this Yelp review? What could make this even better? Old Bay Seasoning for the free popcorn.

4th Avenue Pub is clutch. They have an impressive beer list, is super nondescript though there were some hipsters inside who needed deoderant, and is not too crowded. If you come on a Friday night though, expect to stand because the table/booth seats are rare. I think I've found my new go-to bar.

This is a divey neighborhood spot with a great beer selection and a nice bartender. Friendly if you have questions about what's‚Äã on tap and willing to make suggestions.‚Äã

Not a lot of room but that's‚Äã usually fine as it's not usually packed.

There's‚Äã a back area where you can drink and smoke I believe‚Äã.

I usually end weeknight drinking here so I can't speak to the weekends. If you're‚Äã looking for that chill dive bar with lots of beer, this is it.

Great draft selection that appeals to craft and macro drinkers a like. They had sours, Smokey beers, New England IPAs and other flavor intense beers. On the other hand, they also had more session beers like a Hefeweizen or Oktoberfest that anyone could appreciate.

The bartender was one of the hardest working bartenders I've ever seen. He didn't have a second to relax. They have free popcorn to enjoy alongside your drinks.

4th Ave is a super solid neighborhood pub.  It's a little campy--but in a quiet little bar way--the lights are low, and there are movies playing in the background--and the bathroom has a chalkboard and chalk for your finest thoughts.  The bathroom, by the way, was clean.

I arrived early for a date, and the pub was pretty empty, but by 6:30 it was starting to fill up with the post-work crowd.  We still had no problem getting a small table, and when I went back for a second round, the bartender immediately acknowledged me with a, ""Be with you a minute,"" even though the bar was full.

I'm not a beer drinker, but my cocktail was made well, and was DIRT CHEAP, Y'ALL. A round of drinks for two for ten bucks is nothing to turn up your nose at, especially when the drinks are strong, cold, and immediate.

I wish the music had been a little more quiet, because the other patrons were more loud to compensate, but it's a small complaint.

I'm definitely taking 4th Avenue Pub on a second date.

Came after the Islanders game reading the sign that Ommegang Wittes were $2 off until 2 hours before and after the game. I don't think they have food but have pretty decent self serve popcorn with basic toppings you can sprinkle on. It was a full house. They only really disappointing thing was that at the end, the bartender didn't give us the discount that drew us into the bar. It was busy and a couple of dollars, so we gave a minimal tip and left it at that. Probably a little weary to come back, as we're a huge fan of Pacific Standard next door.

12/4/2017Thanks for the five stars! Amazing! As for the cask issue, we are not a ‚ÄúNo Cask‚Äù bar, but rather a ‚ÄúSometimes Cask‚Äù bar. In recent years the availability of great cask offerings in the format that we carry (pins rather than firkins) has dwindled considerably. We are constantly on the look out for new offerings but it has become more difficult. That said, with the winter months upon us we may see some change. Check out our BeerMenus listing to see if anything comes up: beermenus.com/places/278‚Ä¶ Cheers & thanks for stopping by! Don‚Äôt be a stranger!

4th Ave Pub is a deceptively good beer bar.  It looks like a random ass bar from the outside; walking in, at a glance they have some decent draft options but the place is a little run down.  However look closer at the tap list and the bottle menu, and you'll start to like the place more.  The tap list is full of worthwhile options, while the bottle list has some gems if you look hard.  I got Fullers 1809 old ale for like $9 for a bottle.  That's a steal at a beer store, let alone a bar.

After a few beers, the place becomes a bit more charming.  Bartenders are very good and they don't let beer just sit around like some places.  There is a small backyard area too, not to mention free popcorn.  I wouldn't rank this above St. Gambrinus nearby, but this is a good #2 option for this area.

This is a great bar for happy hour. The bar itself has a lot of personality, as do the bartenders that work here. They have lots of sass. Don't dare getting his attention during a crowded happy hour if you don't know what you want. The guy next to me got ""yelled"" at. It was funny to watch.

The happy hour deal is $1 off all drinks, which is minimal but still a deal. The place was fairly quiet when I walked in around 6, but by 6:30 it was packed and loud and very, very busy. It quieted down a bit by 7:30-7:45 when much of the crowd headed over to the Barclay's Center for the evening's festivities.

The pub is definitely in the perfect location for a pre-concert or pre-sporting event drink or two. The beer selection is vast, and there's a ton on tap. (Stay away from the wine, it wasn't good. But I should've known...)

Beware: they do not serve food here, but you can bring in whatever you want or order from their big binder of delivery menus.

Plus: The free popcorn is a great bar snack and they even offer up some old bay seasoning to spice up your life. ;)

""Free popcorn!""
That was all my friend had to say and I was down to come here.
4th Ave Pub is a cute bar with great outside area. Super convenient location. My cocktail was a little watered-down but it was also a little cheaper than normal. And the popcorn got better and better with each tray!
Random fact: the bathroom is painted in chalkboard paint and there's a tray with chalk. Maybe this isn't the most sanitary activity, but it's a fun idea.

Funny how much one's preferences can change with time--now that I've been in Brooklyn for almost two years, everything about my previous review is pretty much the reverse.  I can't tell you when's the last time I went to Pac Standard (maybe I tired of the pricey wells or of my friend always wanting the terrible nachos), but I go to 4th Ave. more or less weekly, most often to wrap up my night when I want just 1 (or 2) more drinks, a little popcorn to soak it all up, and the company of the best crew of regulars and awesome bartenders I've encountered since moving here.  Beer selection's still great, and they're ALWAYS willing to put the game on those tiny TVs.

Great beer selection and free popcorn, like everyone says.

That said, every time I go, I promise I'll never go back, but I live so close by that it just happens, you know?  The place is just so painfully hipster.  Tiny tv in the corner showing Quentin Tarantino movies--who hasn't seen that gimmick before?  Once, I came in to have a beer and popcorn while catching the end of a football game, and, to their credit, they had it on . . . , but they had it on the Spanish feed (which I understand and is fine, but . . . just . . . why?!?!?).

Pacific Standard for me . . . until the next time I want popcorn and happen to have cash.  Sigh.

Really like the bar next door, yet really wanted to try this place too. A solid selection of craft beer, chill atmosphere, and free popcorn!

Saturday mid-afternoon and almost no one inside. Good variety of beers on draft ranging from $6-10 and a bunch of bottles/cans. A few specialty cocktails are available at a decent price ($8-12). Bartender lady is super friendly and seems to know the locals around here. Popcorn is located at the end of the entrance hall with red plastic bowls on top and a thin scooper to the left of the machine. Solid, no frills popcorn for an equally no frills bar.

No food here (aside from the popcorn) and I can see how it can get crowded fast. Good place to meetup with friends for a couple drinks.

Best neighborhood bar EVER. All the bartenders rock. Especially Garrett, his Tuesday and Thursday night playlists are the SHIT!!! He's lovely and pours the best drinks. The drinks are always cold, the atmosphere lively and the popcorn fresh. They also have a delightful backyard, now that it's summer it should be enjoyed.

Always love coming in for a round, or 3.

4th Avenue Pub is my favorite place to get free popcorn. I don't know if I know any other place that gives free popcorn, but this is easily my favorite.

I've spent many of happy hours, birthday parties, bar crawls, and end of the night stops that I shouldn't have done, at 4th ave Pub. It's pretty consistent.

First off you have a large selection of beer. Now, while some places have tons of options, half of them will be of the same type of beer. Not here. It's a pretty good mix of brews, all varying in type.

I enjoy writing cryptic and odd messages on the chalk wall bathroom. My favorite is to ease drop on a neighboring conversation and then proceed to the bathroom, to write something in relation on the wall. Messing with strangers is fun. Yes, Ted is sleeping with his secretary.

The bartenders are pleasant and friendly. They know how to make basic drinks the proper way. I have to say though, I've never had a good share of buy backs, despite the fact I always tipped well here. Might just be their policy.

There is a good sized back yard with lots of benches and picnic tables. Get a spot early, it gets packed if the weather is nice. Note though, the sun isn't out that much due to the angles of the buildings nearby.

Lastly, and most importantly, there is free popcorn. Whether it's being eaten, thrown at someone, or used to plot your domination over the world, it's free and that can not be ignored.

This is a hidden cheap spot! If you want a dark dive like  bar with free popcorn... you got it. We would always look for a place that will always close at 4am and this was it. Drinks are $5 normally.... they also have happy hour but it's only a dollar off. It's kinda of a dive bar but they have a garden thAt pretty well kept.

We were walking by seeking a local watering hole, when the rep for Troegs Brewing (Gil) started talking to us outside 4th Avenue Pub.  They were releasing their nugget nectar ale at 4th Ave, and he told us we should stop in because the beer is amazing.  He also gave us a kick-ass Troegs poster.  Upon entering, we discovered an amazing beer selection.  We got samples of a few beers that were served in tiny little glasses with cute handles that looked like you should hold your pinkie in the air while you sipped out of them.  4th Ave has a great divey atmosphere and had one of the best playlists that I have ever heard in a bar.  I was in 90's music heaven: Natalie Imbruglia to Blackstreet and everything in between.  My ears and my tastebuds were in heaven.

3.5 stars...

The reason this place has such impressive ratings is because of their relatively wide selection of craft brews on tap and bottles. That and the free popcorn (apply your own salt and/or Old Bay), and back patio.

For me I care more about my calorie intake and budget so although a tasty craft brew is nice from time to time, a $3 Miller Light would make me more satisfied. Drafts start at $6. There's one $5 draft (Woodchuck Cider) or so I thought until the bartender charged me $6 for it and I didn't feel like bringing up the possible typo in their menu.

Their backyard has ridiculously high concrete walls and a complete tree covering so it feels a little dark and cave like but I'm happy with any place that has a decent sized yard with lots of tables (in this case picnic tables).

Overall as someone not concerned with finding a place with lots of craft brews I wasn't wowed by this place but should I want to go out with a beer connoisseur I'll certainly know a decent place to take them.

Free popcorn! Backyard!

Lots of beer options here, as well as a full bar. Don't come for a fancy cocktail- this is not the spot. Do come for beer, popcorn, and a rum and coke. I assume they let you take takeout here if you want to order a pizza with your drinks. Seems like the type of spot to do that.

They DO play football games but the televisions are very small and the CC is jambled, which makes for an entertaining game.

The bathroom in the back is also very, very spacious. The walls are chalkboard, so feel free to write your name, or challenge someone to tic-tac-toe.

I think this place is over-rated in reviews. Very ordinary pub with inefficient semi-drunk waiters, no food at 9 pm, except stale popcorn from an ancient machine.

Nearly 2yrs ago this female bartender named Brigette told me that I cannot ""talk about politics"" in here. I told her ""Who the hell are you to tell me what I can talk about?"" She walks away. I was having a very civil conversation with two guys, no problem, no fight, they were 2 Bernie supporters and I was explaining why I'm voting for Trump. I hadn't been to the bar since, there are other places to go, but I happened to swing through tonight and Ralph says that I'm 86'd from here. Lame. Liberals are the REAL fascists. I'm pretty center-right, reasonable, Libertarian minded but these young people will just shut you down blindly if they THINK they are hearing something against their acceptable narrative. I'll take my money elsewhere. And Ralph, no one ever asked me to leave, no one ever told me to not come back, other than YOU, tonight. I guess being a VERY regular customer for more than 10yrs means nothing to you. And it's also a very old occurance. I'll spread the word around about this corny place.

Oh btw stop calling 911 when BLACK PEOPLE have some sort of disagreement in front of your bar.

P.S. Stop trying to remove my posts! Own up to my criticism of your business! After all, you took my money for more than 10yrs.

This is a cool place! Came here to meet friends on a Saturday afternoon. It wasn't overly crowded but still a decent amount of people there. Since it was still cold outside, I got a hot toddy. It was strong and tasted really good. I love that they have free popcorn to munch on! It's not buttered or salted but you can add your own toppings. I think it tasted good as is though. The bartenders are friendly and attentive; we didn't have to wait long for our drinks. The atmosphere is really chill and it's a great place to just hang out with friends and talk. Overall, solid option in the area if you're just looking for a nice place to relax and have a good drink!

Very confused about the high reviews. I left the bar after about only five minutes on a Thursday night due to how horrendously rude the bartender was. I wish I had caught his name to add on this review but honestly couldn't leave fast enough. He had a thick beard, about as much about him as I want to remember.

The bar was muggy, loud, and crowded. My friend and I were attempting to close our tab and gestured for the check. The bearded bartender sees us and ignores us. We wave again for his attention and he comes straight to us aggressively shouting, ""NO, DON'T DO THAT. I'm a professional. Don't wave at me, I'm a professional.""

No sir, apparently you are not. Professionals don't yell at their customers and throw a tantrum. We were very caught off guard by this hostility and needless to say, have zero plans on ever returning.

I literally live around the corner, so this is my go-to bar. Here's the breakdown of the three bars on this block:

1) Cherry Tree has a great backyard but crappy beer selection.
2) Pacific Standard has a great beer selection but no backyard.
3) 4th Avenue Pub has a great beer selection AND a great backyard seating area.

Another plus is that they serve Delirium Tremens and show IFC movies with no sound. Also, free popcorn and friendly bartenders. What more do you need?

What a gem! A group of 10-12 of us came in here on an okay (weather-wise) Saturday afternoon and were able to find ample seating in the back patio. The beer selection is stellar and affordable (I'm still getting used to those NYC prices...). The inside was dark and most of the seating was at the bar, but the place was clean and the bartender was friendly and ready with recommendations. Plus, free popcorn! I'd highly recommend this spot and will definitely be back myself!

This pub features a great beer selection which gets periodically updated.  Some beers get removed from the menu and some get added on, which can be a blessing and a curse. Personally, it was sad to see one of my faves, 'A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale, no longer being offered the last couple of times I was here.

Decent in terms of prices, even with the top quality draft beers.

Complementary popcorn which you can season to your liking.  I have seen people order pizza from the outside.

Outside seating area. Perfect for enjoying your beer while having a smoke. Despite the 'No-Smoking' sign, everyone's lighting up.

Finally, a very nice, sophisticated crowd. Have yet to witness any rowdiness and I have been here on plenty of occasions.

Oh how I love 4th Ave Pub! More of a dive than Pacific Standard, it's perfect for a low key and very chill night. Plenty of seating with some booths that will fit groups of 6 and an absolutely gorgeous backyard with huge picnic tables. Amazing and varied selection of craft beers on tap which frequently rotate. For example: Smuttynose, Sly Fox, Founder's, Bell's, Delirium, and Lagunitas with many more. There's a huge craft bottle selection and there's always a cask too. Free popcorn makes this place a definite win!

Walked to the table to be seated and waited patiently as the barman did what he needed to do. We asked to be seated outside and was met with a groan and alright. It was 7:40pm but still thought it wasn't bad we were coming for a beer or two and fries. We waited for a bit and then he sat another group down and took their order immediately. Then went back inside and attended to two other parties that showed up. Then went back to bar. Don't know what we did to offend this guy but we just did him the favor I guess and left. Super strange. Never felt vibes like that before. Oh well. Food looked like it woulda been alright too.

Basic bar located on a stretch of eateries for the after work crowd. Saturday afternoon, plenty of room inside this dimly lit place both at the bar and at the tables.

Large draft list is written on the chalkboard at the back of the bar, so quickly was able to order an IPA ($7) to go along with some Nachos w/Guac ($15) to start. Nachos are your standard fare - a big pile of chips topped with cheese, peppers, sour cream, guacamole ($ extra), tomatoes, and greens. Cheese could have been better but the cream and guac made up for it. For the main course, ordered a Pulled Pork Sandwich ($14); a meaty serving swimming in BBQ sauce, barely staying inside the bun. Fries that come alongside are seasoned well and seemingly handcut.

Overall the food was above average, the draft list is excellent, and the service is quality. Great spot for a low-key afternoon in the area.

Change in ownership huge decline in service and food. They used to have such good food! It was a huge disappointment to try the new menu and be so disappointed. The old chicken burrito and tortilla soup here was amazing. The chicken burrito now is much smaller. It's no longer served wet. And it's very bland.

The service has also declined tremendously. I can't tell you the number of times the bartender walked by our empty glasses without offering a refill. It was bad. But to really put the bad service over the top our bartender decided to ""give us a little splash."" That is instead of a typical buy back where a bartender gets a round for you, he took our glasses and half filled them. It was ridiculous.

I'm super bummed because this has been one of our favorite spots in the neighborhood. The old bartender Pete was fantastic. Another great bar bites the dust.

It used to be a pretty decent place, my girlfriend introduced me to it, she had been gong for years.

Recently there seems to have been a change of some sort in management or staff.  We've given the place a few tries recently but have officially given up.

Let night (a slow sunday) at 10:30 pm we went. We almost always sit and eat at the bar.  With very few other customers in the place and us prominently seated at a bar with only one other set of patrons ( a man and a woman with a 5-ish year old child), we went unattended though both of us were both thirsty and hungry.

We had enough time to turn the wait into a wager game.  I think we both lost when we decided to leave after twelve minutes of the bartender skillfully eluding our gaze through many personal distractions such as his phone and other pressing fidgety. We made eye contact with a bar back who seemed nice and saw someone else peak out from the kitchen, but the bartender could not seem to see us.

It's a bar, the food is meh bar food. If the service is good than its ok.  If you find yourself on the ""pay-no-mind-list,"" you start to consider the nightmares Gordan Ramsey might find in their kitchen.

Walked in. Was greeted by a rude tall server. Rolled his eyed when I told him we wanted a table. Then when my friend asked if they had local beer (we are tourists and clearly don't know) he rolled his eyes and pointed at a menu and walked away. So we all got up and left. Found a spot a few doors down with a more welcoming staff.

Came here on a Friday night after work and was instantly greeted enthusiastically by the Manager, Michael. Michael provided great conversation and was polite and attentive the entire evening. I drank wine and decided to curb my appetite with an order of wings and a side of brussel sprouts. The wings were served pretty quick after placing my order which was great. What I found was that the wings were fairly large to come out so quick. The wings were glazed in an Asian Zing sauce which was flavorful. Unfortunately, the wings were under cooked which were pretty hard to get through. The Brussel Sprouts however were delicious down to every bite. I would venture to try other selections in the future to see how they measure up. The aesthetic still has the classic feel, which is perfect for those nights for unwinding and catching a game.

Post-dinner on a Saturday night as the Power Of One (me, myself and I) was mostly crowded- particularly by the bar area.  Tables are majority non-occupied and standing by the entrance waiting to be greeted by the hostess to be ushered to a seat was a few minutes of being invisible.  An American neighborhood pub located in Brooklyn Heights, typical, with TV screens plastered against the wall for the sport aficionados attaining their daily intake.  With a strong doubt I sensed a strong negative aurora for patronizing this business based on being invisible for several moments and the difficulty of flagging the waiter.  The service is mediocre as my server appears melancholy.  In silent acquiescence, she rose to her feet to place my food order and attain my wine without further ado - without a smile, without any life in her eyes.

Quality of food is MEH.  When inquiring for drink suggestions I was informed we have a full bar, okay in hopes of ordering a frozen drink Henry Street does not have a blender ergo why laid the claim ""we have a full bar""?! False and misleading information.  They do offer a small selection of brew beers.

C√¥tes-du-Rh√¥ne-Villages (Rh√¥ne Valley, France) $11.00 - subtle finish for red.  I did not taste any oak.  Henry Street's wine glass contains a sharp inside curved ream, perhaps, to prevent spillage.

Caramelized Pecan Brioche bread pudding $7.95 - dessert from the daily Special was very heavy, rich swimming in caramel, ergo, I did not finish.  There is no shortage of pecan nuts embedded within either.  Caramel is a dentist worst nightmare to create immense dental damage.  I was not offered a glass of water upon being seated.  It does not appear that other dessert(s) were available either as a daily special or listed on their food menu.

Great place to have a local craft beer. Stopped after a trip to MOMA. I had the Neuburgh Brown draught beer and my DH enjoyed the Barrier Top Dollar IPA. Very good.

I'm a Brooklyner since 1990. I've been to HSAH dozens of times and always had a reliably good time. The building has been family owned for 25 years. The interior is lovely and timeless. I hope it never changes. Sadly, there has been a recent change in management and with that, a rather concerning decline in service.

Like several reviewers (below) I too sat at a mostly empty bar and was unapologetically neglected for long periods of time. It's quite bizarre.

After three visits for a burger & beer at the bar, here are my tips:

* Expect a 5-10 minute wait for the bartender/s to notice you.
* If the bartender takes your order, smiles confidently and then walks away from you AND the taps, don't worry. You will eventually be served.
* Now that you have a beer you can flaunt it.
* If you finish your beer before your burger arrives, you should budget another 5+ minutes for anyone to notice.
* If the burger arrives and your glass remains empty, you should speak up lest ye remain unserved.
* The burger is fine.  If you say no lettuce there will be lettuce, etc.
* The fries are not delicious.

It's a shame. A venerable spot, spoiled by negligence.

My favorite local spot for a quick bite after work.  It's usually not crowded which is to my liking (although it deserves better).  The tap menu is always changing which makes it exciting!  On the food menu the burger is my favorite.  Outside of that almost everything else on the menu I've tried has been delicious.  The bar tenders here are usually really really attentive and are really ON their game!
On the more critical side, I wish that there were more full pint pours for all IPAs since they hardly carry high abv brews (9% and beyond).  I'd also like to see a stronger stouts and porters.  I hardly ever see any belgian style stuff, it's mostly on the lighter end of the spectrum!?
Ok, anyway.  I love this place - I do.

This bar is relatively unassuming, dimly lit and tucked between lots of other Henry Street food/drink options. But it's casualness and relaxed vibe is why it's so great.

We got there at ~8PM on a Thursday night. The bar was almost full but there were plenty of empty seats at the tables. We sat ourselves and received food menus quickly from the waiter. I had a pint of the Harvest Cider (delicious) and ordered the Burrito special at $15.

This burrito was SO good. Carne asada, guacamole, sour cream, pico de gallo, and black beans with a side of spicy salsa. It was wrapped and grilled--perfect in every way. My boyfriend got the friend chicken sandwich with fries. The fries are excellent and I thought the fried chicken was solid (nicely complimented by the chipotle mayo).

This place is a little pricey for what it is but the food is worth it. We'll be back.

Not a huge beer selection, but what they've got is top knotch. Great friendly bartender/owner too. Kitchen closes on the early side on weeknights, but can't blame them based on the area. Just get there early! Great music too, and tons of seating (bar and tables).

I have been a loyal customer of this wonderful bar for 15+ years...but recently and only recently, they've tried to change the menu and make the food a little fancier (perhaps to compete with other places next door)?

But here's the thing...they don't need to compete. They were perfect. An oasis in the sea of ever-changing restaurants with their trendy fare.

The staff and the decor are polite and wonderful, I just wish they'd stop doing whatever it is that they're doing with the menu.

When something's perfect, you don't need to change it.

Bring back the nachos, the house salad in those wooden bowls and regular lettuce and get rid of dessert again...you guys have it all wrong, all those other places should be competing with YOU.

I come here all the time. After a month out of NYC I came back, and found to my horror that their lineup has changed. The beer tap list used to be a bunch of craft beers which I was only able to get here, and which was worth biking over the bridge for. I would come here and in one evening taste several beers and drink three I liked. Now half the list is the usual unmemorable stuff: Brooklyn lager, delirium tremens, and, would you believe it, Stella.

I asked the bartender what had happened and they said the management has changed. I really hope they preserve the craft list.

Love this bar. When I lived in Brooklyn, this was a regular place for me, usually coming once every other week. Unfortunately I moved out to New Jersey which makes it a little more difficult to drop by since it's an extra subway ride, but I still do try to come here every couple months.

The ale house is super easy to get to, it's literally a block away from the High Street subway station on the A and C lines. They do a pretty good job managing the seats at the bar so you always have a place to sit when you walk in.

The beer mix is an eclectic one- but I say that in a good way. I normally consider myself fairly well educated with beers, but I often find ones here that I've never heard of.

The food here is definitely a notch above your regular bar grub. The chicken pot pie is enormous, and there's always a few daily specials worth checking out.

Wish the owner of this place would consider opening another location closer to where I live. The place has definitely grown on me since I wrote my original review a while back.

	2/14/2013Previous review
Owned by the same person that owns the Park Slope Ale House, this place takes 2nd place in my book.  A good selection of food well priced, the quality is somewhat less than I'd expect after being a regular at their other location.  Some great beers on tap, but a little too much focus on international brews for my taste.  Bartender is very helpful, but sometimes this place can have a bit of a snooty attitude.

I've been going to the Henry Street Ale House since I moved to Brooklyn Heights ten years ago, and am sad to report that the place recently took a very strange turn. They must be under new management who aren't from the area as the menu no longer has the affordable and hearty pub fare they were always known for, but items like chicken hearts (!), gizzards (!!!), and over-priced naked hamburgers. They used to have the best chicken pot pie, tasty fish&chips, and a massive burrito, but alas no more. The barbecue pulled pork was another yummy favorite and that's gone too. Also, my husband is a pescatarian, and there's not much left for him to eat there (even their vegetables have meat in them). I did order the fried chicken sandwich last week and it was a sloppy and really delicious treat, though I waited a half-hour for it to arrive. Hrmph!!!

I'll still pop in for drinks on occasion after work as they have the best beer selection in the nabe, great bartenders like big Jerry from the old Waterfront Bar on Atlantic, and I enjoy the music being played, but I'll have to seek out another place for my neighborhood pub food fix.

Love love love this sweet & packed place. The food and service was flawless if crowded. It is a very special neighborhood restaurant. I really enjoyed the local color of our neighboring tables - an older, elegant couple  in one side and a couple gals out for the evening, who were having a fine time loudly using colorful language. I love to eavesdrop and had great entertainment all around.

Hubs had duck - the best I have ever tasted, I had a classic Caesar and a bowl of butternut squash creamed soup. One of our group had the wild game special if venison osso bucco. Though we ordered key lime cheesecake and something deeply chocolate, the house gifted us with the best house dessert - 21 layer crepe. That was the piece de resistance! It was absolutely light as air and delicious!
A wonderful meal, a great place and a fantastic evening!

I thought it was meh. We biked across the crowded Brooklyn Bridge as the sky turned dark and cold, we were hungry and literally went to the first place that had no wait. I see why there's no wait. The food was mediocre. I guess the mini burgers were cute and decent but I wasn't a huge huge fan but it wasn't bad either for quick food. Out of the chicken, ribs, and mini burgers, I definitely favored the burgers & fries :)

Honestly, there are so many bars in Cobble Hill...this is the bottle of the barrel. Generally, the service staff is unwelcoming and drinks are over priced and under poured. They act like it's a restaurant so you are asked to be quiet yet its name is an ale house. If you're interested in eating eat food, then come here for dinner

I am beyond disappointed in what was once my favorite place in the neighborhood. After Ralph and Chris, who came from the old Waterfront Ale house left, the menu has completely changed. I am not against a healthy change, but there is nothing left for a pescatarian like myself to eat. I loved the blackened catfish, it's gone. I loved the burrito, it's gone. I loved the Mediterranean salad, it's gone. There are no fish dishes, the veggie burger is obviously a frozen patty that I refuse to spend money on, and the once delicious Caesar salad is now made with kale, and kale is terrible.
I will be making the trip a little further to Custom House in the future. I'm sad that I will no longer be seeing the excellent bar and wait staff, and I hope to find out if they get employment elsewhere, so that I can continue to give them my money 3 times a week.

This is listed as a restaurant and it uh, probably shouldn't be. It's clearly a bar that happens to also have some food laying around?? Nothing we ordered was good and I don't think they have AC??

Peter is the man. He really knows his beer and takes bar-tending very seriously.

Tiny beers during the summer changed me into the person I am today. Can't emphasize the tiny beers enough.

Try the nachos. Good for after a walk across the bridge.

The service was outstanding! Coming from Australia we were still a little new as to how to order and/or pay etc. at a pub but the bartender/server here was so friendly and accommodating to us despite her being the only one working and under  the pump.

The food was inexpensive, yet amazing. We ordered just small meals for ourselves but they were massive, and filling. The beer selection was similarly great. A beer, or cider, for every tastebud. Would definitely recommend, and revisit if we are ever in Brooklyn. Thanks for the great experience!

This is our ""Cheers"" - our go-to in the neighborhood. We were disappointed when they made the menu a bit too upscale for our tastes, but they are slowly bringing back their old standards. Terrific selection of beers on tap and service is always friendly without being annoying. I'm a huge fan of their chili (though I miss their homemade tortilla chips - those were amazing), burgers, nachos (they did recently return but weren't as good as they originally were), fried chicken sandwich...surprised by the 3.5-star rating.

If you come here ( a bar ) watch how loud you get bc the owner came over to a table of five on a Friday night to tell us to Lower our voices because we were too loud . His excuse is the "" acoustics aren't good here "".  My man , the food was good, but you will never get our business again . This is a Brooklyn bar on a Friday night .. too loud ? We're eating burgers and having a beer , really ?????

Smh....

Update -
We just called the owner over ( after our gratuity was included into our party of 5, without us knowing ) to tell him how insulted we feel bc we were targeted in a bar that everyone is making noise in .... and his response is "" I'm sorry , I couldn't hear myself think "". Sooooo did you go over to every table to tell them to lower their voice ? Or just us with the table of African Americans , Caucasians and homosexuals ?

Pete is a legend in this neighborhood. Total veteran, and knows everything worth knowing about the beers and liquors they offer, but I've been given great recommendations by the other bartenders as well. Their rotating draft is extensive, and I end up trying something new every time I walk through those old school doors, due to the fact that I have heard of about 20% of the beers they serve.

They have no WiFi, and reception isn't great. So leave your phone in your pocket and pretend you live in a more simple time.

Great selection of unique craft beers, and surprisingly really good food, for this small, local, pub!

Specifically, I always come back for the southern fried chicken. This is not bone-in chicken, rather, fresh, juicy, pounded boneless homemade cutlets, with great herbal flavoring....I think I taste celery salt? I skip the gravy, and sub out the mashed for their awesome hand-cut fries! All the apps are great as well! Try the cheddar jalape√±o poppers with their rich buffalo sauce and sour cream, or the stuffed potato skins. Not a big fan of the burger- a bit too much if a char for my liking...

We like to sit at one if the two sidewalk front two top tables, for great people watching, if you can score one!

Ambiance: 5/5
Food: 5/5
Service: 5/5
Covid-19 score: 6/5, bonus point for being dog friendly!

I'm not sure why it took me so long to visit Da Claudio, but I'm so glad I did and I can't wait to go back! The restaurant has outdoor dining across the street, the tables were close in proximity but I'm glad we had clear dividers. The service was top notch, our waitress Hannah was so sweet and showed my puppy Zeno (@go.zeno.go) so much love! Our other waiter (sorry I didn't get your name) always made sure my water glass is filled, talk about attention to detail!

Fritto misto: 2/5, will probably skip this next time
Black Linguine: 4/5, although the shrimp was a little soggy, the spicy tomato sauce was so incredible that I'm still thinking about it
Spaghetti Carbonara: 5/5, pasta was perfectly al dente and honestly you just can't go wrong with carbonara

Da Claudio's is excellent every time eat-in or takeout. It has become and absolute favorite of my partner's and mine during quarantine. Owner is attentive and servers are effervescent. Starting at the bar, there are incredible cocktails and a very nice wine selection.

The pasta is what I DREAM about though. I find myself craving the spaghetti carbonara and fusilli cacio e pepe with a side of their wonderful bread. Another favorite is the tagliata strip steak, always perfectly cooked to order. The restaurant has a nice rotating list of specials in addition to their solids.  I hope the veal scallopini comes back soon!

I am a long-time fan of Da Claudio, which is just around the corner from work. I think I've had nearly everything on their menu at some point, but I like their heavier traditional offerings like lasagna and eggplant parm. I can't recommend their desserts enough, especially the cannolis--delicious!

These positives all apply to dining in, however. A while back I was in the area and ordered takeout to support a favorite restaurant. I regretted it. The lasagna and eggplant parm were both in these small takeout boxes and could barely be considered a serving. Dining in-house gets you big boat style plates with the dishes featured in the center and a nicely shareable portion, so it was surprising to pay the premium for both the lasagna and eggplant, but to still be hungry after we ate them. The Brussel sprouts portion (also the same size box) was generous and delicious.

What really got me was the drinks, though! I wanted to add a couple of drinks, again to support a beloved restaurant. They ended up charging me $17 for a plain Negroni! Seriously?  And the apperol spritz we got was similarly overpriced. I don't mind a $20 cocktail that is well crafted, complex, original and with great ambiance, but the cost here was ridiculous. I regretted ordering from there at all, but it was too late to cancel the drinks by the time I saw what they were charging.

The takeaway is to not do takeaway. Wait til the crisis is over and you can join them in-house again.

I finally had the opportunity to check off a place off my restaurant bucket list.  I made my reservation for a late dinner on Opentable. When I arrived at the restaurant the outdoor dining was setup across the street from the restaurant there were two tables designed for two people and the remaining two tables are designed to seat up to 4 people.

When I arrived, I had my water but they ran out of individually wrapped straws. The complementary roll cut in half was cold and hard so it was not consumed. I ordered the frito misto (fried calamari, fried shrimp and fried fish) and mango cheesecake.  My server was knowledgeable, pleasant and accommodating.

The frito misto ($23) was delicious, the appetizer was meant for sharing but definitely a great meal for one.  After finishing my dish, the server returned to clean the table, which was amazing especially during these times. The mango cheesecake ($12) was the perfect portion and a great ending to my meal experience.

I will definitely return to this restaurant to try their paninis, which I heard was huge.

This place has been on my to try list for awhile and I was thrilled when I realized it was around the corner from my brother's new place. We initially had planned to dine outside but it was a chilly night and after seeing that the tables were spaced apart well, we decided to dine inside.  We had a lovely table away from others but it was still nice to enjoy the lively atmosphere inside.  Great cocktails to begin, really knowledgeable and accommodating service.  They let us enjoy our cocktails, order and eat at a leisurely pace while also being very attentive but not intrusive. And let me not forget the food.  Salami/cheese plate and fried artichokes to start. Squid ink pasta and fettucine with sausage ragu for a mid course. And finally, sea bass on special and grilled octopus to end.  We loved the food, we loved the atmosphere and we loved the service.  We will definitely be back.

Great 25$ prix fix lunch. This Lunch has plenty of options for appetizer and main course also come with choice of expresso or cappuccino. Caesar salad  was great and the Pepper pasta as well as the bolognese . Service great and also the wines by the glass. The value is great and the quality superb. One of the best lunch values in FIDI.

A very pleasant and surprising meal here! Came around 6 on a Friday night, there was a decent crowd but no wait. I was surprised at how big the space was, really liked the open kitchen as well. Decent happy hour deals as well that last until 7pm.

We started with the meats and cheese platter for two, fried baby artichoke (both a part of happy hour menu) and burratta which was one of their specials of the night. The meats and cheese comes with 3 or 4 types of meat and 4 different cheeses, two servings of each. All our appetizers were good, definitely worth getting if you're there during happy hour. I got kale carbonara spaghetti which was another special they offered that night and my boyfriend got the pesto gnocchi. The carbonara was good, spaghetti cooked al dente, LOTS of pancetta. The kale which is grinder and mixed into the carbonara sauce made the pasta itself taste less heavy, really enjoyed this. Although I didn't feel like it had a heavy kale flavor, but definitely tasted like a good carbonara. The gnocchi was cooked pretty soft, and pesto was strong. String beans was a nice touch to it.

Our food came out pretty quick, and the servers would take away our finished plates as soon as they noticed we were done. The waitress was also nice, came by a couple of time. Definitely give this place a try if you're around here and craving Italian.

While staying at the Beekman I found Da Claudio on Yelp. What a Wonderful restaurant the owner and our server Andrea were so attentive to us , Incredible appetizers and great meals had by all 4 of us. My son and his girlfriend had birthdays and they brought out candles and a birthday wish in chocolate sauce on the desserts. This was followed by a complimentary round of lemonciillo!!

Amazing place. Probably my favorite restaurant in FiDi. If you're going for lunch, get the prefix, I usually go with the Caesar to start and the wagyu bolanganse. Its $30 but amazing. Drinks are good too! The wine list is exceptional. The service is top notch. I would absolutely recommend anyone coming here.

Tip: it does get busy, despite it being hard to find, make a reservation!

The best part is the shrimp with head-on! Oh yea! Gimme all you got! So ok, I went downtown to meet my old supervisor and a friend who worked at the same office many years ago (across from the World Trade Center). She gave me a few suggestions and we picked this one. The manager (or he could be the owner) was a friendly gentleman who likes to joke, also a nice fellow.

Juliana was our waitress. She's friendly and attentive. We ordered calamari to share. The calamari app includes some fish. Then I had the black linguini with shrimp. My friend had salmon special and that looked super neat and fresh. My dish was unbelievable! The shrimp came with the heads on. I'm glad they didn't cut the head because I like the head. Did I mention that I eat fish head a lot too? Most people want to know the secret of my good memory. Fish head! That's the answer! You'll be thanking me for the rest of your life for making you remember everything that you try to forget! My pasta was delicious, I won't forget that. The sauce was very good. My friend liked her salmon dish. She said she's been here before and liked the food the last time she was here too. Good to know they're consistent. We both finished our meals.

The restaurant's pretty big with a high ceiling and we sat by the booth. I got a pretty good view of the whole restaurant. I definitely enjoyed dining here. I hope you do too!

A super authentic Italian restaurant in downtown MH! The place is nicely decorated with a modern chic and comic book drawings along the walls. The ambiance is nice and there is also a full service bar.
Food here is delicious and the open kitchen window allows diners to see inside their inner workings.
Bread with fresh extra virgin olive oil is provided for the table.
I had the cacio e pepe pasta which was amazing.
A bit pricy but definitely worth it!

We came here on a Friday night with a reservation. We were seated immediately.

We ordered the meat and cheese platter, steak, spinach, and octopus. Very delicious food! We had our steak well-done, and it was very flavorful.

The ambience was great - very big and open. You can even see the kitchen as they are preparing the food. Perfect place for a romantic date or catching up with a friend. I really loved the low lighting, the bar in the restaurant and interior decoration. The ceilings are quite interesting.

Servers were friendly although I found it difficult to flag them down at times. Bathrooms were clean too!

First time here and definitely had a great experience! They do happy hour from 5-7pm DAILY with great selections of wines too. I really like the decor and the atmosphere there. The server was super nice and the pasta dishes she recommended was on point as well. Really great pasta dishes if you're looking for great quality pasta.

Things I ordered:
- POLIPO: octopus, potatoes, olive tapenade, capers
- GARGANELLI: wagyu bolognese, parmigiano
- BUCATINI CACIO E PEPE: cheese & pepper

If I could give this 0 stars .. This is the worst Italian food I have ever eaten in all of Manhattan. I am better off grabbing frozen gnocchi and string beans from the supermarket, drowning them in disgusting pesto and calling it Da Claudio's. The staff is disgustingly rude it actually ruins the ""ambiance"" some people say is so nice. Did I mention it is super expensive? Well it is. I don't mind paying a little extra for some good, authentic Italian food. But this? God bless. Good luck not getting food poisoning. Enjoy.

Da Claudio came up as the most highly rated/reviewed/seen/visited spot for  Italian food over in the Financial District and as someone who was on a mission to indulge in the better things in life, I had to stop in here for dinner. I came in on a Sunday and it was pretty quiet within the restaurant. I was immediately sat in a cozy booth in the back, which was lovely. The entire atmosphere of the restaurant was very chic and elevated and contemporary but still managed to feel cozy and romantic at the same time. There were families with children, friends, and couples dining so this spot is clearly able to cater to anyone's needs.

The customer service was very attentive and friendly. Our glasses were always full and they checked in just enough to make sure that you had exactly what you needed without feeling overwhelmed. Everyone was incredibly professional and courteous. The menu was spot on and it was honestly hard not to order one of everything. I also love that they sell wine by the glass, half, and then the whole bottle. Their bucatini amatriciana is spot-on, especially paired with a glass of chianti. I'm determined to keep coming back until I try every pasta dish on their menu.

Randomly stopped by here and glad I did. Great place for a romantic date night or a casual dinner. The drinks were very tasty and strong, can't go wrong with the classic mule. Loved the cacio e pepe and with chicken added, gave it a great flavor. Would definitely stop by here again if I'm in the area.

I had a fun work lunch at Da Claudio last month while I was visiting New York. The restaurant was pleasant, nice and comfortable with an open, contemporary feel. I showed up with a cake, which the staff kindly offered to keep refrigerated while we ate. Service was good generally, too, friendly and accommodating and attentive.

The food was great. I had the garganelli with wagyu bolognese and parmigiano. This was excellent, the rolled pasta cooked al dente, the bolognese and cheese meaty and satisfying. I got a cup of blood orange sorbetto for dessert, and this also hit the spot exactly, just a light, refreshing way to finish my lunch.

If you're looking for a good Italian spot in the Financial District, Da Claudio seems like a pretty safe bet to me. I've only been this once, but I enjoyed my pasta and sorbet, and would definitely come back if I lived in New York.

The food here was pretty good, but we were just meh on the service. My boyfriend and I came here for our anniversary dinner. I decided to make a reservation, even though it's usually not crowded.

We were a few minutes late, but it wasn't a problem at all. When we sat down, though, the couple next to us told us that the waitress had overcharged them twice on their bill, so we went into dinner a little skeptical.

Our waitress was very nice, though. We ordered the burrata special to start, which was pretty good except it was mostly cabbage. My boyfriend ordered the bolognese, which was the best dish of the evening. The pasta was cooked really well, and the sauce was super flavorful. I got the spaghetti carbonara. I thought it was pretty good, but I've had better in the city.

We didn't order dessert, but the waitress brought over a tiramisu for our anniversary. We thought that was very nice of the restaurant, until I went to pay and saw that they had charged us for it, even though we didn't order it. I thought that was kind of strange service. Decent restaurant overall, but there are better Italian options nearby.

This place was hustling and bustling when we arrived for dinner at 7:30pm on a Thursday night. The service was excellent and the appetizers were delicious. The reason I gave only 3 stars was because of the pasta dishes. The ragu sauce was not very flavorful and adding salt or pepper just wouldn't be enough. I would return but only to have appetizers!

Across from the Moxy hotel sits Da Claudio. I've eaten here 3 times & the wait staff is excellent. I came here today with a large party and overall the experience was good. I ordered the Eggplant Parmesan and it was ok & was $22.00 on the lunch menu. The lunch menu is not cheap but it is average for the neighborhood & the portions are a nice size considering the cost. I enjoy the staff more than the food here but I prefer more hearty heavy Italian food & this is not that kind of restaurant. I might go again & try a different meal.

Food: I got the pasta Bolognese. It came as penne pasta with meat sauce. So yummy! Added extra cheese and red pepper flakes for more taste.

Price: not bad. $22 for my dish

Service: good service. Accommodated a 12 person party well. Even remade a dish when it wasn't cooked well

Overall- classy atmosphere with reasonable NYC pricing and a good quality meal.

Service: Phenomenal. Our server was pleasant, helpful and attentive.

Ambiance: Cute and quaint.

Food: Octopus was mediocre. Black linguine was a winner! The brodetto de pesce was sad, over cooked clams, shrimp and calamari. Appreciative of the chef's second attempt, but he or she still came up short. Tiramisu is a must.

All in all, I would probably give them another chance.

Recommended restaurant with nice ambiance, great food and amazing service.
Had dinner here last night with a party or 5 colleagues and we all thoroughly enjoyed it.
Our server Naomi from Italy was the best! So sweet and professional - she told us a bit about her experience in NYC. She was very attentive and made sure our glasses were full and kept checking on us.
Montepulciano wine, amaro, limoncello and a great tiramisu made my night. Will come back.

My son and I went to Da Claudio's on a Sunday night which was very quiet.  I'm so glad we found this restaurant.  We loved it and it was so nice to sit outside, have a couple of drinks, a delicious appetizer and dinner.  Everything we had was excellent!  The waitress was so sweet and asked us where we were from and to be sure to come back to visit them next time we're in town.  She was so personable.  I think she said it was her 3rd day there.  It seemed she'd been there for a long time.  Next time we make a trip to NYC, I will make sure to go there!

New York prices, but the service was wonderful and the food was above-average - so it was an overall enjoyable dinner experience for us at Da Claudio.

I loved that they had a quite a few specials on the menu (a number of which involved lobster - my favorite!), but I ended up going with the first thing that I had set my eye on, the Black Linguine (squid ink pasta with prawns). It wasn't the best version I've ever had, but overall a satisfying meal, and the prawns were very fresh. My husband ordered the Tagliata (sliced strip steak with herbed potatoes) - the $42 price tag almost was a deal-breaker, but we decided to splurge and let me just say... it was a HUGE meal. Honestly, it was at least double the size of what I would generally expect for a steak dinner - and it was absolutely delicious too.

The service was exceptional - prompt drink refills throughout the night, and they instantly brought us a brand new bread basket once we worked our way through the first (what can I say, we were hungry...). To be fair, it was about 9 PM at night, so it was pretty quiet in there, but I still always appreciate awesome service.

The location was also super convenient for anyone staying in the Financial District - we were staying at the Moxy Downtown, and this place was literally right across the street. So, it was the perfect option for us on a night where we weren't wanting to venture far, but still wanted to feel like we were going out.

All things considered, this place is a nice little Italian restaurant worth visiting.

We walked across the Brooklyn Bridge and searched for a place nearby.  We couldn't have been happier with Da Claudio.  Delicious Italian food, outdoor seating, attentive server.  Give this place your business; it's great.  Also, one person in our party had an egg allergy, and they were very nice/accommodating/understanding about it.

Surprisingly good. Didn't expect it coming from the business smart decor in the heart of the FiDi.

Staff was very friendly and made me feel welcomed.

Octopus was beautifully presented. Flavors were well balanced and the Olive Tapenade complimented the dish excellently.

Gnocchi was served with perfect Al Dente texture, and the Pesto was as homemade fresh as it comes.

We found this great place after doing a search for an Italian restaurant that took large groups. We loved every part of our experience there. First of all, the ambiance was very nice. Low, decent lighting, and despite being full the noise level was great. Our party was able to have a normal conversation.

The host was very friendly and professional, making sure we were always taken care of. The staff were fast, attentive, offered great suggestions and we never felt rushed. They had very creative cocktails I'd never heard of and the food was delicious, all fresh and decent sized portions. We had the Caesar salad, grilles vegetables and potatoes, lasagna and a mixed seafood dish. This was a nice surprise and all agreed we'd be returning.

I am so glad they are open!   I work nearby and have been going here for years.   Everyone I work with loves it here.   I got takeout for the first time and it did not dissapoint.   Additionally the customer service and attention to detail was amazing.   You must try the artichoke appetizer with breadcrumbs and every pasta dish is amazing.  The salads are also great for lunch.   Please support this wonderful local business!!!

I totally agree with the other 3 star review, service was really bad for us.  Not only did we feel ignored while other tables were tended to I feel like our girl gave me complete attitude on multiple occasions.  At one point she said she would be right back after she opened some wine for a table, okay...then she continued after that to take orders for two other tables.  When I had to flag her down again after that she gave me complete attitude.  WHY?  Just apologize and we can move on....We litterally then placed our order and I asked for a glass of wine the next time she came around...she then had the nerve to ask me with full on attitude, ""so do you want it like now, just really just when I come around again?""  Mouth dropped at that comment.  Sadly this made everything terrible as the food was tasty but bad service just ruins everything for me.

Dependable new Italian restaurant that opened up near Fulton Street. Ambiance and prices are perfect for FiDi company lunches where meals generally are around $30, but not the Italian restaurant of choice for dinner dates when the area is dead and the food doesn't justify the trek.

Came here twice for a company lunch. First time, we ordered the Prosciutto di parma with fresh fruit as an appetizer for the table. The prosciutto tasted good and was perfect for sharing even for a group of 5. I ordered the steak on a bed of pur√©ed polenta as my entree, which must have been a special since it isn't on the regular menu. Despite being a tiny bit overcooked, my medium steak was soft and paired well with the pur√©e and watercress on top.

Second time around, I opted for the prix fix lunch for $25, which comes with a soup or salad, a pasta entr√®e (unfortunately not all pasta dishes are included in this deal), and your choice of latte, cappuccino, americano or tea. Not that I had many choices to select from but I was glad to have ordered the Insalata di Rucola as my appetizer. The Caesar salad that someone else on our table ordered looked so plain that I couldn't believe how romaine lettuce with a couple of croutons and some sprinkled Parmesan cheese could cost $15 outside of the prix fix menu. Forget dreaming - there's no chicken in that salad. Insalata di Rucola, however, also consisted of simple ingredients but the dressing was everything. That lemon dressing was so light and refreshing at the same time; I couldn't stop eating it. It totally made the prix fix meal worth it for me.

After hearing that the Carbonara last time was a little dry from coworkers, I opted for the Garganelli with wagyu bolognese. The pasta was very al dente and sauce was standard affair, but it felt like something was missing there. I simply didn't feel excited to finish it. I did finish it but was left craving something else. My coworker ordered the Calamarata, which had all different types of seafood and large thick cut pasta, but it was too salty for my taste.

Unfortunately, our party opted not to get dessert...both times we were there (sad face). We just had our lattes and called it a day. However they have all the standard Italian desserts on the menu for those with a sweet tooth.

Came here after work party for drinks.

Italians from out of town were seated prior to my group (place must be legit).

Wine was flowing.

The octopus dish was alright, I feel like there was too much of a bitter taste (was it artichoke?).

The mixed calamari and the carbonara were on point.

They make a serviceable Maker's old fashioned.

Awesome little Italian spot in lower Manhattan. Service and food was great! They do have a happy hour menu in the bar from 4- 6 PM with drink and appetizer specials. My friend and I both started with the arugula salad which was delicious and very fresh. I had the cacio e pepe for dinner and it was excellent. The portion was HUGE and could absolutely be shared. I will be back!

Came here with my dad and partner before a church service at St. Paul's. Had the fried artichoke appetizer, wagyu bolognese and chocolate mousse tart. Service here was really excellent and the owner Claudio was super cordial. The fried artichoke hearts were really good and so was the bolognese.  This place is definitely a nice find if you're in the financial district. Only complaint is that some of the hazelnut ice cream had ice crystals in it like it had melted and then ben re-frozen.  But they did have a wonderful bottle of Nero D'avola Sicilian red wine.

Upon first glance, the menu at June seems limited - they are a wine bar, after all! We still decided to check it out, and oh my goodness, was it worth it!

First things first - if you plan to try any of their wines, definitely go for it! But be prepared to buy by the bottle. This came as a bit of a surprise to us - who wouldn't want to try multiple different wines? But in the end, we got a unique plum/apple cider and were very happy with our choice.

The ambience is very intimate. It's not a huge place and the tables are quite small. If you've got a larger group, there are a few tables for you all, but we would recommend a reservation to make sure you've got a spot! It's also extremely dark, so excuse our potato photo quality :)

The food was to die for. Oh my goodness, was it delicious! We ordered the Potato Croquettes, Koginut Squash, and Colorado Lamb Shank.

The Potato Croquettes were melt in your mouth delicious with an amazing spicy aioli to dip in! The aioli was just the right amount of spice to give the potatoes a nice kick.

The Koginut Squash was very fresh and had me feeling healthy! The dip it is laid in was herby and savory, and was very reminiscent of middle eastern/Indian tastes. To me, it felt like home.

The Colorado Lamb Shank was the highlight of our night - the lamb was so perfectly cooked, it was fall of the bone tender. It is laid in a Strawberry X.O. sauce, which surprised us, because it didn't taste sweet at all - which we were quite happy about! After chatting with the chef, we learned that the Strawberry X.O. is extremely dehydrated strawberries, such that the sweetness is eliminated, laid in the X.O. sauce which is very umami. It felt like we were eating a salad, due to all the hearty greens and goodness, but was still incredibly tasty and filling. We might have to make this dish a monthly thing!

To top off the night, we ordered the Honey Crisp Tart Tatin for dessert which was just the right amount of sweet. I'm a big dessert girl, but Ricardo isn't huge on the sweets, and yet he loved this! It wasn't too sweet to leave you dehydrated or overwhelmed but just the right amount to have you very satisfied. This dish comes with vanilla ice cream on the side, but be aware, this is more like a froyo (with the emphasis on the yogurt part), so if you're not a yogurt fan you may not enjoy that addition to your dish.

I have been super hesitant about outdoor dining, but June turned out to be the perfect spot to do so.

Masks are required when entering, but once you are seated in the garden area, you can remove yours. The outdoor seating exceeded my expectations. Tables were seated way more than 6 feet apart (THANK YOU!) which really calmed my worries. The space is also very nicely decorated, string lights and all. A sweet little oasis during these crazy weird times.

Of course, they are known for their natural wines so we had to give them a try. I tried both the red sparkling and orange sparkling. The red was much sweeter, but the orange really was my favorite. According to new regulations, if you order a drink, you also have to order food, but fear not! June has plenty of small dishes to safely share. We went with the Fig & Pecorino, as well as the Whipped Ricotta dip. Both matched really well with the sparkling wines that we ordered. If June had a more extensive dinner menu, we surely would have ordered more plates to try.

The staff wore masks at all times, and tables + chairs were thoroughly sanitized between customers (I saw this with my own eyes). They were also super friendly and made the experience so much nicer.

We liked our wines so much that we actually purchased (numerous) bottles to take with us. I can't wait to enjoy my new favorite wine at home!

CUTE! CUTE! CUUUTE! We were seated inside, but the happy hour crowd started trickling out and we moved to the garden and boy am I glad we did! Noticed other parties did the same. The patio deck and garden seating made the entire experience.

When you order wine, they give you a swig first to make sure you're satisfied with your selection before pouring the entire glass. I chose a '17 ros√© that wasn't too dry.

Now the food is GREAT, suuuuper fresh. There were like 6 figs halved in the stracciatella. Ricotta dip was really refreshing, tomatoes were bomb, and sliced baguette was crusty the way I love. I can also confirm the succotash and chicken plate were decent at the least, only because the older couple next to us looked so impressed as they ate their meals. Yes, the seating is elbow to elbow unless you've got a larger party- just a warning.

This isn't a 5 for me because desserts were confusing, plates are small (which I get, tapas = small, BUT for the price), and seating is tight.

June is a wonderful oasis of very cool, very interesting wine in a cozy location with great decor and an option for booths, bar seating and outdoor seating.

The wine list is really the reason to hit this place up.

What a great find!

Of all the places we could've chose from in the area, we are super glad we decided to walk in here. Without a reservation, our server was real nice and accommodated us quickly with a seat outside in their cute backyard area. The backyard is spacious and decorated nicely with a wood barn type feel and nice hanging wire lights above. If its nice out, I recommend getting an outdoor seat.

They serve tapas here mostly, so small plates to share. I speak for all of us when I say the ricotta dip got us friggin hooked! so good that we ordered a second one before we even finished the first. I'm not sure how that ricotta was that garlicky and creamy but it was to die for. The toasted/buttered sourdough was perfect for scooping copious amounts of ricotta as well. The Heirloom potatoes were also a big hit for us. Nicely cooked fingerling potatoes tossed in a creamy sauce and chunks of saut√©ed crispy pork belly. The charcuterie board was simple and delicious. My only comment was the eggplant. The sauce was great but the sesame and flakes on top didn't do well for me, great flavor tho.

The also have a nice assortment of cocktails and a huge variety of wines.  I got the Silk and Soul, really refreshing, and I highly recommend it!

Really great ambiance and rare natural wines on the menu. Good looking crowd. Amazing location. I will say, we had to order food due to the covid restrictions so we got olives. They tasted terrible! So maybe find a new supplier. Obviously no one comes for the olives but just saying.

What a slice of loveliness. The details are irreverently appointed. The music and energy is sophisticated, yet relaxing. I had a glass of white wine (pictured) that was the best glass of wine I've had since I was living in Paris. The salad was not boring and in fact had little surprises throughout. There is a quaint back patio. If I lived in this neighborhood I'm pretty sure this would be my living room as I'm sure it is for many. I will be back!

Super cozy wine bar with an incredibly helpful and friendly staff. The wines are all organic so they tend to be a little different from what you'd expect. With that said, both times I've gone the staff has helped navigate me to something new and delicious. Have not had a chance to eat here yet but their charcuterie looks delicious.

The perfect mix of classy and vintage, but still hip and modern. June is a great date spot, with dim mood lighting and a huge drinks menu (it is a wine bar after all).

I stopped in with a friend for drinks and apps. She ordered the Graft cider and I had the Lavender Fields cocktail, plus a charcuterie board to share. The charcuterie didn't include bread, but it could be added for an additional $1.50 (which I think is just a bit pointless). I would definitely recommend the charcuterie purely on deliciousness, not on price. It's $15 for a choice of two meats and $9 for one. Our two choices were divine and just enough for the two of us.

My friend enjoyed her cider and my drink was exactly what it claimed to be, extra lavender-y. It was a bit too syrupy for my taste and quite thick, but that helps you drink slower?? I would probably go for something else next time, but one drink miss wouldn't keep me from returning. Our server was very friendly, attentive, and willing to explain everything on the overly posh menu (another possibly off-putting element, but hey, talk the talk?).

The extensive menu allows for many return visits with new drinks to try every time and the gorgeous interior makes for a great backdrop. If you're looking to show off your refined tastes to a date or maybe even your parents, June is the place to go.

I wish I could brunch hard. You know, like multi cocktails and no worries hard. Instead, I have less opportunities to do breakfast at lunch time. So when I do, I want to be selective in my choice. June will not disappoint.

If I'm in a sweet craving for brunch you'll get a mixed bag of options for French Toast. Finding June's French Toast to be closer to a bread pudding soft style was a delight and just what I was looking for.

We got there early and had the place to ourselves. They have nice little booths inside and it's dimly lit and charming in an old world style way. Service was spot on and drinks came quickly and went down just as easily.

If you're in the hood and craving a laid back and low key vibe with excellent food check out June.

Great wine bar. They even serve fluffy deep fried potato balls! But the server in my pic is an ahole. He kept treating us like we weren't annunciating or speaking loudly enough. Trust me, I annunciate and am semi-loud. Go for the wine but don't let this dbag treat you like you're low-class or whatever the f he thinks you are.

Loved the ambiance here. Came on a Saturday while waiting two hours for table at Lucali. The waitress behind the bar was very friendly and helped us choose wine and taste it. At around 8 pm the tables and bar around us filled up. There's an outdoor space but it was closed for a party. It has an old school yet trendy vibe, good for a date. Prices on par with any NYC bar. The food looked good though we didn't order. Recommend!

This is a great spot to meet up with your friends for a casual evening out. The wine list is extensive (it is a wine bar after all), and the noms are decent. We tried Heirloom Potatoes (with Pork Belly and Butter Milk Dressing) , the Egg plant, 2 steaks, and the stracciatella. I would come back for the happy hour. It has a very cute outdoor space.

Great assortment of small plates, even now during COVID. We especially liked the one with summer squash, can't remember what it was called. Everything was clean, and service was friendly and efficient. I tried their sparkling orange wine on a whim, and it was pretty good. I was afraid it might be sweet, but it was nice and dry. Tastes like a dry cider. Overall very nice experience.

I loved June!  Located on Court Street, this is a very intimate, classy wine bar reminiscent of a French bistro, with wonderful creative cocktails and wine selection. The marble-top counter top bar is delicious to sit at and watch mixologist Nicola (a Venetian direct from Italy) shake up his famous ""Venetian Sunset"" cocktail.  He pours generously and is happy to share his ""secret"" recipe. The other staff are all warm, easy and friendly. My favorite bar in Brooklyn. Perfect place to pre-game for a night out, or just relax and enjoy a few too many Sunsets.

Came here today for brunch and it was different... there was no eggs Benedict or anything on the menu, i ordered the first item on the menu and it was a bowl of avocado and egg with mixed nuts over rice, it pretty much tasted like an everything bagel on rice... my friend got a salad with fish and I preferred mine better, the fish was a little too fishy for my personal preference but if you eat he whole dish together with the squash it balances everything out pretty well. They have a decent variety of teas and I believe we ordered the pi lo cha? It was good. The best part of the meal was probably the side of sour dough that we ordered. I did not like the grape jam but the bread was off the hook! It comes looking like French toast so don't be alarmed... we thought they gave us the wrong order at first

Had a fantastic birthday dinner here for my lady last night. It is a beautiful spot and special thanks to Ashley for accommodating our large group (10) in the somewhat private back room. We were very comfortable. We sampled a variety of selections from the smaller plates section of the menu as well as a few entrees and all agreed on how delicious and fresh the food was. The service was also above par. I was very impressed with our server Shannon. I am not used to the level of professionalism she displayed. Great drinks too! Thanks folks, we'll be back!

I am a bit of a wine geek.  I don't mind trying some different wines, reds especially, from different areas off the beaten track.  This wine list was made for me.  I had a Rh√¥ne Valley red from Magnum (special Thanksgiving week sharing and an Italian Nero.  Both of which were served at proper temperature, always a plus.  Offerings from Austria, Hungary, Georgia (the country not the state).   Deep offerings from areas not in Burgundy and Bordeaux, like Jura.   A very well thought out and curated list.  Appetizers are excellent.  Service was very attentive and friendly.  I might have a new favorite wine bar.   A definite must go to in Brooklyn.

Came here for a late brunch on a lazy Sunday after my archery session. The weather was hot yet beautiful outside.

June is a sexy little spot that takes you to a different world as soon as you walk in.  The inside was calm and cool with a soft buzz from all the patrons sitting at the bar.

The lighting was bright since it was day time, but all the booths lined up on the side gave the whole place a classic and relaxed feeling.  I would love to come see this spot again at night.

""Me and My Arrow"" seemed like a nice fitting cocktail to start with, and also ordered the duck rice and crostini.  The cocktail was really well made; refreshing with strong citrus notes.

The duck rice had a deep flavor.  I would definitely order this again.  The salmon crostini was well balanced.  The smoked salmon and cream cheese with thick cut toast gave every bite a smooth and luscious texture.

All the plates were neatly presented and tasted fantastic.  Would recommend all of them.

I love this place, and have been here twice. The first time was on a cold winter night when I sat at the bar with a friend. We had some 'orange' wine (similar to rose) which I didn't even know existed. We also shared some small plates, all of which were delicious, including the mushrooms, brussels sprouts and a salad-all seasonal, light, fresh and definitely small yet satisfying.
I returned on a Friday night surprised at how empty it was and we scored a lovely booth. We had a bunch of drinks and it is just a beautiful pleasant atmosphere. Dark-romantic I suppose. I would bring a date here but totally fine and realizing for friends. They do close at 2am though.

I came here for Saturday brunch on a sunny Winter day and it was just lovely. We made reservations though Resy--not that we needed to. When we arrived it was only half full, which actually made for a very relaxed atmosphere. They have a little patio area at the back. In the winter, part of it is closed off, but you still have lots of light from the windows and can look outside.

The service was great. Everyone was super friendly. The coffee was delicious (and I'm pretty picky about coffee). For food I had the Frog in the Hole, which was a great size and extremely tasty. My friend had the Farro bowl, which he liked, but was a little small for someone with a big appetite.

I wish I lived closer so I could be a regular at this spot. I'll definitely be visiting again.

A very cozy and fun place that we were surprised to find in Cobble Hill.  It felt romantic and dim as soon as you walk in.  Staff was friendly and service was fast.

They have a large wine and drinks list.  The dishes have unique flavors and well prepared with top quality ingredient.  They have quite a number of French wines to choose from.  We opted for a bottle of Ruth Lewandowski Boaz that paired beautifully with the lamb breast.  Everything tasted great and we didn't want to leave the place.  Will come back for more...

This is such a wonderful spot to meet someone for a drink. It's charming and dimly lit for a casual but could-be-romantic vibe (definitely a great date spot), with great aesthetics.

The servers were attentive and quickly brought us menus. There's a large wine list (with glasses in the $9-$15 range) with a nice cocktail menu ($12-14) and draft/bottle beers/ciders. I'll admit, even at a wine bar, I ordered a cider because they had a new Graft that I had been wanting to try. My friend ordered the Lavender Fields cocktail which was lemony and lavender-y. It was subtle and quite delicious.

We also ordered the charcuterie with a side of bread (I recommend the side of bread, what they don't tell you is that it's buttered toast and perfectly crispy/soft). It was $15 for two meats and you get a decent amount. Overall, I would note that the menu is on the fancier side with prices a little higher.

A great, relaxing spot to meet a date or a friend. I will be back to try the wines and additional cocktails!

June's interior is to-die-for cute. Character in every corner. It's a really great ambiance, I bet this place would be sweet for a night out with friends. However, I came here for a brunch and was unimpressed by the food. Nothing was great for me or the two people I came here with. I had the ""frog in the hole"" after asking the server for her recommendation and it seemed like something I could make at home... but it was lacking the homey feel. For what we got I also felt the price was too high. Nothing was bad and the services was friendly. Consider trying this place for ambiance and drinks, skip the food (at least the brunch).

I was so excited about this lovely spot. Great decor, music, menu and happy hour right by my job!  I've been in twice and the bartenders have made me leave each time.  Work is hard enough, no reason for the bar to be unwelcoming.

June came highly recommended, but the drinks and the service/ambiance were just okay. The service was quite slow - including the process to be seated, receive a menu, and to flag someone down to order. There are many wine choices of course, but the server seemed impatient when I asked questions so I only picked what was familiar to me. I would come here again with friends but I found the indoor area to be a bit too loud for a date.

Great date spot / casual place to meet with friends.

Food was good (squid dish was a standout) and the wine was delicious.

Will plan to come back!

Excellent cocktails. Extensive wine list (with a few high quality beer choices as well). Gorgeous decor. Hospitable service. Best of all, they boast diverse and original small plates that range from quite good to absolutely outstanding, and they are, improbably, pretty reasonably priced.

In case you were wondering, we shared the slow baked carrots (solid, but the accompanying Roman gnocchi are stunning), the cassoulet (rich and delicious), the kale salad (it is Brooklyn, after all), the acorn squash flatbread (yes), and the brioche (fuck yes). And it was more than enough for dinner for two.

June may be new to the neighborhood, but as far as I can tell the only shortcomings seem to be that it should be at least four to five blocks closer to my apartment, and it's going to be tough to get a seat.

Beautiful spot for the intimate and romantic date that you seek.

They have great music and curiously more people willing to be seated at the bar than the table. The answer probably is the bartender makes some mean and fearful drinks.

This place offers tapa style dinner while the serving might be small but the flavor is top of the class. We love the lamb and hummus with bread. There are many many dishes to pick from however we suggest to order them one at the time as the table isn't really that big.

Seating is not an issue before 7:30PM however that's when most people started to enter. As online said no RSVP, that is not true. You should really call them and they will accommodate. Waiting staffs are wonderful and very very professional.

Great new wine and cocktail bar on Court street. It's in the old Van Horn space, and they did a wonderful job renovating the place. Love the lighting, the mirrors, and the bar. Very old school vibe. Kind of like a miniature train station.

Their wine menu is impressive. Very thorough, with lots of wine types I'd never even heard of before.

But I came here for the cocktails. At first I was skeptical because they only had 6 cocktails on the menu. But after tasting a few of them, I could tell that they put thought into crafting each one.

The Infinitely Late at Night was a brandy cocktail with rosemary and genepy. Very well balanced, and you could taste all of the ingredients. Strong but not overpowering. A bit on the sweeter side.

Also tried the Things Behind The Sun, which had gin, vermouth, besk, apricot and sour orange. Decidedly more tart than the Late at Night, but also very good.

The second best part of the cocktails is that each one has at least one ingredient I haven't had before. The first best part is that the cocktails are reasonably priced at $10-12 apiece.

Bartenders are great (and good looking, if you *must* objectify them). But most of all, they mix a mean cocktail. It seemed like they had 5 or 6 people behind the bar at once to fill all the orders, which made service super quick on a Friday night.

Great date spot too! Maybe cozy up to an indie movie at Cobble Hill Cinemas, grab some wine/small bites at June, and finish off the night at Chocolate Room? That would definitely get me into bed.

Looking to treat yourself, or have someone treat you? THIS IS THE PLACE!

Every bite melts in your mouth literally e v e r y bite of e v e r y dish this place serves up. The wine, without question, is fantastic.

Coming from someone with bizarre fermentation allergies who is usually allergic to most wines and vinegar... the wine here never gave me any reaction other than pure joy!

Nick the manager will help you above and beyond your needs with an amazing attitude and lovely demeanor.

June wine bar is a dream, even the bathroom is pretty.

One of my favorite neighborhood gems in Carroll Gardens. It has a really extensive wine list ranging from white to sparkling red or white.
It can be a bit tight so it's perfect for one on one time with a friend or a date. I love the food here. I usually get the bread & ricotta basket, turnips  and ham plate. I usually share the trout and get the olive cake for dessert. I love that it's alot of vegetable plates and they are really tasty and I don't feel guilty when I leave.

Went at 11am on a Sunday when it opens - no crowds and got the quiet backyard to ourselves. Cute space. Our server was so friendly. We went with her recommendations - savory bread pudding with ham, tomatillo and egg; frog in a hole with Shitake mushrooms. Got a side of slab bacon to share.

The bread pudding was so unique and delicious. Savory and soft with ham inside the pudding, and tangy tomatillo adds a ton of flavor to it. The frog in the hole was good - I enjoyed the mushrooms and the soft center of the egg. But it wasn't super flavorful/didn't stand out to me as much. The bacon was very well cooked.

I love how they have a short, seasonal menu. All the more incentive to go back and try other dishes before they are gone. Wasn't blown away but definitely one of my favorite neighborhood brunch places overall.

Tables were well spaced out. We went on a Thursday at 6pm and had no trouble getting a table for four. I had the ""Never Never"", a refreshing summery cocktail of Neversink Gin, Yellow Chartreuse, dry vermouth, pineapple, lime, honey, and tonic. My partner had the ""My Dear Julius,"" which was Bourbon, damson plum liqueur, lemon, cinnamon, maple, whiskey barrel aged bitters, orange bitters, egg white. They require that you order food, which we didn't know about beforehand. We got the burrata bruschetta - I liked the burrata but the tomato could have been better. Overall, I would definitely come back here for drinks again!

Blueprint has outdoor seating in the front as well as in the backyard area right now! The front was all taken, so we took the back which was much nicer imo!
They seem to be more known for their cocktails, as a lot of their food reviews were just okk. But we enjoyed everything we ordered!

I loved the Parks and Leisure cocktail (vodka, aperol, grapefruit). Super refreshing and a pretty orange/pink color! My bf really liked his old fashioned too.

We also ordered the chicken liver mousse pate, which was reallly good and I'd definitely order again!! Loved the onion on top, and you MUST dip in the flaky sea salt

The brussels sprouts and bacon pizza was just ok though. The pizza bread is more of like a cracker bread and def did not like. BUT the toppings were great! Roasted brussels, small bits of bacon, and cheese. I would've liked the dish on its own (not as a pizza) OR as with a different bread/crust.

With dim lighting, tapas to share, and bomb cocktails, Blueprint is perfect for date night. The moment we entered, all we saw were couples, so beware if you are thinking of coming here with friends. They also have a cute patio in the back that can be used during the summers - check it out if you come here!

The food wasn't mind-blowing, but the drinks were delicious. We got the bourbon based My Dear Julius and gin based Satan's Bell. My Dear Julius has egg white in it and therefore is a tad heavier. I expected Satan's Bell to be your classic gin and passion fruit juice flavored cocktail, but was pleasantly surprised by the red bell pepper juice that unfettered the drink! Satan's Bell was light, sweet and presented well. Kudos to the bartender, who invented it.

The food. We came here for dinner, which was supposed to be the main event, but left enjoying the cocktails more. The baby octopus with potatoes was okay but had more potatoes than octopus and wasn't anything to write home about. The roasted Brussel sprouts were a bit disappointing as they completely lacked salt. We dipped the sprouts in the lemon juice of the octopus dish to give them a bit of a kick. As the final dish, we got the Blueprint duck club, which definitely was the largest plate of all. The club sandwich had thinly sliced tasty duck meat. It was the first time I had duck as deli meat. Definitely not your typical date food though. Your hands are a bit of a mess after holding a club sandwich that looks like could belong to a diner.

Dropped by here on a very chilly November evening and was pleased to step inside and see a warm setting with lots of people around.
First the space: is very nice and certainly cozy/intimate but is well suited for small group or pairs. There is lots of bar seating and there is a full menu at the bar.

Next is the menu - there is a lot going on and a good selection of (New York) reasonably priced cocktails from the house list. There is also a reasonable selection wine and a handful of beers to choose from. However, the real reason we were there was for the pate or the whipped chicken liver dish. My partner had his heart set on that. So in addition to several excellent cocktails, we ordered two of those and the hummus which was also tasty.

Sitting at the bar by the door, we did not feel cold or jostled which was pleasant. The bar tender was attentive and things were taken care of quickly for us.

Overall, a great spot worth coming back to.

I've been writing this review for months... lol. I kept bypassing it but last night I stopped in for a drink and dessert and just had to share why I like this spot.

Setting: after 7pm the mood to me says date night. The lighting is dim and the tables are set for intimate conversation or you can sit at the bar and flirt with the bartenders...lol.

Drinks: the drink the night was called the Doctor is in...if you like a gin cocktail w/ a lil rum and a pretty flower this is the drink for you! My companion had wine, and enjoyed their pinot grigio.

Dessert: the bread pudding...OMG! It's my favorite dessert and I like to try it at any new spot I go to. I'm floored there's a spot this close to me with bread pudding that's so good.

Final thoughts: I'll be there tomorrow

Okay guys, I just found my new favorite summer spot. Blueprint, of course, has an indoor bar and some tables but the outdoor space is SO, so charming. If you want to impress your date (or yourself, or your friends, or even a stranger tbh), take them here.

We walked in on a Friday night without reservations so I figured the back space would be off limits but the sweet hostess was able to squeeze us into a nice little corner spot. For those of you who breezed over that sentence, let's note that the hostess was not only polite, but exceptionally sweet. A rarity in NYC.

We took our seats and promptly ordered some vino with our waitress who, AGAIN, was another darling. Too good to be true? Nope. Real life. Exceptional service from start to finish.

We also kept a menu to order some bites later on and I'm happy we did. The baby octopus was delicious, served with what I could only guess is tomatillo sauce, and potatoes. Definitely a good little plate to split. We also split the fish plate with cured salmon, another good choice for a light bite.

I'm so happy I found Blueprint. I'll definitely be back!

The cocktails deserve 4 stars but the food and service are definitely 1. I don't know if it's just because they are operating during an uncertain time of they just have a bad staff. All the food tasted like it was sitting in the fridge for 5 days and everything was less than mediocre. The waitress didn't ask us ONCE how everything was. The food runner did more than she did. I would only go back for drinks in the future. I guess that's what you get for eating at a cocktail bar.

Oh Blueprint, you will always hold a special place in my heart. It was here that I first met my fianc√© and had some of the best cocktails I've ever tried. Nestled in the first neighborhood I lived in when I moved to the city, it's quite the find for ParkSlope.

In an area pretty crowded with sports bars not far from the Barclays Center, it offers a welcomed change of pace. Blueprint's classic and old-school charm carries far and wide in all of their drinks, food and service and I'm so so happy I found you. Or should I say found me. It is the perfect date spot. So for my 100th review I will write about you.

Oh where to begin, I suppose a good place would be the cocktails. They have a great selection of specialty drinks that range from a delicious grapefruit drink to a classic manhattan. We usually like to start the night off with happy hour which is pretty great with decent priced wine, beer and cocktails. They even offer little tasty bites. My fianc√© will get the chicken liver mouse and I will get the hummus. His and hers and oh so delicious! We usually go for the baby octopus as well!

Now theres so many different ways to go about the food selections. We've tried almost everything and keep coming back for more! The pork sliders speak right to my southern soul and the rabbit pot pie is right up my fianc√©es alley. Or you do a classic meat and cheese platter with large selection of artisan cheeses and delicatessen meats. They even offer desserts. We tried the bread pudding the last time we were in and can I say it was love at first bite?

I don't really have a bad thing to say about this place. Go here. Drink up and fill your bellies with the best this neighborhood has to offer. Take it from me you won't regret it!

What a great late night Brooklyn bar! We stopped by on the way home after a late dinner in Manhattan to grab some drinks. There weren't any seats left in the main entry room but we were led to the back to some booths near the bathrooms where it was slightly quieter.

The cocktail and alcohol menu is quite extensive. I was able to choose two gin cocktails and enjoyed them thoroughly. The Beauregarde was tasty and sweet while the Last Word was less sweet but not any less delicious. Both cocktails were between $13-14 which I find quite reasonable in NYC (well, Brooklyn).

I've heard the rabbit pot pie is excellent, too - will try next time!

This spot is pretty cool. It is advertised as a tapas spot which is indeed true because even the ""big plates"" are a smaller portion. We ordered the FID & RICOTTA BRUSCHETTA: a house made ricotta topped with mission figs, oregano & honey sherry vinegar and the NIMAN RANCH PORK BUTT SLIDERS: pork on house made buns, served with red cabbage slaw, spicy pickles. I quickly realized that i did not like figs so that dish did not enthuse me too much but if you do I am sure you will love it. The pork sliders were really tasty I can always appreciate a good pork slider. The drinks were great and although it was packed the waitress was quite attentive. This is definitely a happening spot to grab a drink and some tapas in Park Slope!

Blueprint is the kind of small, cozy and neighborhoody spots that have solid cocktails and does not have a pretentious vibe.

The set-up inside... Blueprint is a long and narrow establishment, meaning, there's adiquate seating, but not a ton; both bar seating and (smaller) tables. Just the way I like it.

Oh, oh - and I got this cocktail... ready for it? With red pepper flavor. It's definitely different, and it's definitely good. I can assure you, it was tasty - not sweet and well worth giving it a shot. I got two.

The bartenders know their stuff, are friendly and will definitely address and explain and questions you have.

Here's the part you've been waiting for... yep, they have a super cute and cozy outdoor space that you'll want to check out as soon as possible. Oddly enough, the drinks go down a little smoother and quicker out back.

This is definitely my new favorite cocktail bar in the neighborhood, and honestly in Brooklyn.

Listen, I love cocktails, but these cocktails are insanely good. We've tried 4 and they were all ridiculously high quality with special ingredients and history!
I like anything sour and citrusy, but everything was good. They had one with watermelon and mint thats a summer special that was amazing. Also the cinnamon, orange cardamon one is delicious and the berry rosemary one was probably my favorite

We came here pretty late. 12:30 am on a Friday... (thus can't remember the names of the drinks)and the place was not empty! Blueprint is open till 4 am and the kitchen closes very late too. We were still ordering food at 2 am!

The food is amazing as well. We got the baby octopus and the Brussel sprout bacon pizza and it was delicious. The pizza is made of naan bread which makes it so doughy and good. The baby octopus comes with roasted potatoes and this jalape√±o onion fresh salsa.
For dessert we got the bread pudding that was amazing!

Definitely coming back next time for happy hour to enjoy their amazing deals

Staff is super helpful and nice!

I love blueprint seriously 6 out of 5

Good cocktails, unpretentious crowd, great space, good food.

Blueprint was the 2nd stop in our night, and we were at that hanger stage for something to munch on (preferably fries!). Blueprint has lots of good reviews and their food looked pretty good, so we figured why not.

We came in at around midnight and it was about 2/3rd busy. We found space easily and were attended to in a quick manner the whole night. For drink, I got the Never Never (a gin drink with yellow chartreuse, rosemary, and a few other things I can't recall at the moment) which ended up being incredible and just the type of herbal I like. For food, we got the chicken liver p√¢t√© and the rabbit pot pie, which sounded comforting and delicious.

The chicken liver p√¢t√© was on point and the caramelised onions atop were simply divine. Beware though, that you should not skimp on the p√¢t√©, as there is more than there looks to be in that small ramekin. While this was not fries, it was so good that I felt compelled to close my eyes at random intervals of eating to truly appreciate the flavour.

The rabbit pot pie was underwhelming to be honest - the puffed layered pastry on top was hard and broke off in chunks. We were also expecting a crust of some sort to which there wasn't. The rabbit meat was sparse, but there was an abundance of nontraditional pot pie veggies - mushrooms, snap peas, etc. It honestly tasted more like my Chinese mom's stir fry than a traditional pot pie. It was unexpected, but not in a good way.

We are definitely coming back, but probably staying away from main courses and sticking to the drinks and p√¢t√©.

Very cozy ambiance, especially on a cold night. Came here to cap off a dinner nearby and this place was so warm and lovely. Ordered the satan's bell and the minotauro and they were both great cocktails. Would've never thought to have a red bell pepper in a cocktail but it provided an interesting kick to the drink that I loved. The minotauro is essentially an alcoholic chai drink that was also delicious! Would definitely come back again.

I was meeting a friend for dinner and drinks and she suggested Blueprint. She is unfamiliar with Park Slope, but wanted to come hang out, and it's near my job. Unfortunately, we picked to go during prime time. I got there just as the last table was taken, so my name went on the waiting list. My friend was running late, which was fine because Blueprint was quite busy. Busy means good usually. In this case, both good food and good service.

When I first walked in the door, the host came over to explain that they were fully booked, it was going to be a wait, and almost immediately asked me if I would like to see the menu. Periodically, he would check in, give me a status update in terms of a table, and would see if I wanted to order a drink. He was so top of the door, new patron walked in the door? He was there in seconds, explaining there was a wait, handing out the menu, and telling people how many people were in front of them. He had his stuff down! It was a long wait, but it was very organized.

Just as I was being seated, my friend walked in the door, and the bartender came by to let us know happy hour was ending soon. My friend got the kickstarter, which tasted like a cold espresso. Delicious. I got a Smokey Mary's. It is my idea of the perfect cocktail. I love tequila. I love spicey. I love everything about this drink. My friend also got the minotauro, which she loved. For dinner, we got the burrata and she did the rabbit pot pie, and  I did the squash and fig salad. The only thing I would have done different is, instead of the burrata already on the bread and I kind of love that moment when you cut into it. I would have preferred the burrata and with the bread not assembled. Personal preference, but the flavors were excellent.

Will be going back here. But next time, will probably be making a reservation first.

We recently moved  back to Brooklyn. I had forgotten the perks of doing laundry in a neighborhood unlike our previous location. Chuck excitedly looked at me after putting the wash in and stated that he would like a cocktail and that it was currently happy hour at blueprint. We walked over and got two seats at the bar. Our bartender gave us the menus and mentioned that we had about 10 min before happy hour ended. We quickly decided on a cocktail and sat back while he created some beauties.

I have been here a few times in the past. It can get very busy but on a Monday, it was nice, dark and subdued. It felt like the perfect place to spend a chilly fall night. On this particular visit, we only grabbed the two drinks ($9 each). I've previously had the hummus platter and one of their pizzas. Both were definitely something I would be happy to reorder in the future. The food menu is fairly unique, many with twists on more traditional bar food. I'm thrilled to be living so close so I can try more soon.

Hung out in Blueprint while waiting for a dinner reservation in the neighborhood. Very very cute antique-feel cocktail bar. Drinks were quality and staff was friendly. I didn't have any of the bites but I would definitely go back to sample the menu - there were even a good amount of vegan options.

Loved the vibe, I am glad I stumbled upon this place!

5 stars for the cocktails, the small plates, and the staff - everyone is so friendly and accommodating and full of great recommendations. I recommend the cocktail that has bell pepper in it (can't remember the name) and also ""The Last Word""

Nice bar with little outdoor deck. Inventive cocktails and a good cheese/meat plate. Not cheap. Seasoned clientele.

I've only been here once (I seldom leave my nest of Manhattan) to meet friends for drinks but I felt I should leave a good review as the atmosphere was trendy, laidback but also probably flexible for various occasions.

First: Dim.
Second: Creative menu, good cocktails
Third: A lively vibe with various seating arrangements
Lastly: SUPER LOUD. So bring your loudspeaker please.

A bit small for my opinion but the bar had a good amount of seating.

I would say it was the Brooklyn and smaller version of Penrose in Manhattan.
Wouldn't go out of my way for this place but for the locals, it's a fun spot

Great cocktails. So warm and cozy in this tiny bar. It is kind of this railroad style bar, long and narrow. Delicious cocktails and bartenders who are creative. Cute date spot and a great place to share some cheese and meats and apps. The cocktails are all amazing, you cannot go wrong. We tried four different cocktails, but hard to even recommend one because it is all based on your preference- you can't make a mistake here!

Almost hidden amongst the plethora of hip restaurants and bars on 5th Ave, Blueprint is most definitely a place you shouldn't overlook! Upon entering you're immediately struck with the ambient atmosphere, giving it almost a speakeasy sort of vibe.

A friend and I came on a Thursday night for a celebratory ""It's Almost the End of the Week"" cocktail. Our bartender was incredibly friendly and suggested a few drinks that he thought we'd like upon hearing our preferences. I ordered the Minotauro while my friend went for The Doctor. Hands down, my drink won!

Both were amazing of course, but I have to say the Minotauro tastes basically like a chai latte (one of my absolute favorite drinks) and it goes down smoother than any other cocktail I've ever had! The best part is that it's quite high in alcohol content too as I had a nice buzz going on from one drink. If you're headed to Blueprint and you're a chai latte lover, you know what to try!

Ultimately my experience here was positive. I'm a bit of a walk away otherwise I'd absolutely be a regular. Pretty jealous of those who live in the vicinity!

Great cocktail place. Big fan of the d√©cor, which is classy, cozy, and intimate.  And a bigger fan of the cocktails. Sure, the server will forget your order and will come back to ask a second time to ask what you ordered EVERY SINGLE TIME. And sure it's loud and packed and people will unapologetically encroach upon your space. And yes, you may end up in the company of someone that you find somewhat annoying who may or may not be spitting on you. Oh wait just me? Okie.

But those cocktails. So delicious. And being conveniently located in Park Slope is a plus. Mixology-quality cocktails at Brooklyn prices. I enjoyed the Kentucky Tanlines, My Dear Julius, and Old Fashioned. PS - You don't actually need to drink three cocktails. Two will definitely suffice unless you're actively trying to make the company better by drinking more. Just me again? Whoops.

The food menu looks pretty awesome too, and would definitely come back for dinner.

This place was absolutely awesome. My cousin was staying in Park Slope for work and after a long back and forth about who would come to who (I live in Manhattan) I relented and agreed to go to her hood. I found Blueprint through Yelp and it looked promising and it definitely delivered.

We were able to be seated immediately and a waitress came over and gave us cocktail and food menus. If I had one complaint about my experience, it would be that the service was a little odd - it was unclear at first whether there was table service or not, and the server (granted, she was alone) wasn't very communicative. It definitely took a while for her to come take our order, although once she did everything came out relatively quickly.

We both ordered cocktails - mine (My Dear Julius - $12) had bourbon, Damson plum gin liqueur, lemon, cinnamon, maple, whiskey barrel aged bitters, orange bitters, and egg white. My cousin's (The Doctor Is In - $12) had Dorothy Parker Gin, Rhum J.M., absinthe, maraschino liqueur, lemon, and house-made grenadine. I preferred mine, although both were absolutely delicious and wonderfully crafted. I find that it's really hard to do egg-white drinks well, but mine was perfect. Both were also beautiful, which I always appreciate. Clearly a well-trained bar staff.

We also ordered dessert - there were only three choices, but all of them sounded good. We decided on the cherry bread pudding because it sounded interesting ($8) and it was honestly one of the best things I've ever had before in my life. It was truly incredible and absolutely melt-in-your-mouth. We also got the pickles (weird combo, I know) which were $5 and slightly overpriced but were house-made. My cousin thought they were too spicy although she was just being a little byotch - they were great.

Overall, everything was incredibly well-done, and although I can't imagine myself rushing back to Park Slope (sorry, BK), if I ever found myself in or near that area I would definitely come back again.

Cool patio, free WiFi, clean bathrooms. Takes cards.

I came to Blueprint on a Sunday afternoon with a few friends for drinks. It was pretty busy, and the only space available was at the bar, but that was fine. We were immediately given two coasters, and on one of them was placed a glass of water - very good start. The drinks are varied and interesting and reasonably priced. If you're not busy chatting with friends or looking at your cellphone, watch the bartenders in action. They must live on caffeine, they never stop moving. One of them is quite adept at mixing and shaking two drinks at a time. Someone needs to take and post a video of him doing that.

Love this cocktail lounge. I've been here a few times, I'm not normally a specialty cocktail guy, but I did love 'The Smokey Mary's ,I also  had some boquerones and cheese plate at the bar, I loved it because it was that weird time on a Sunday in the slope where brunch is over ( not sad about that) and dinner time is an hour plus away, also factored into this equation was that it was after a Nets game and you can maybe follow me back around to the understanding of my choice and enjoyment of this establishment. I needed a stiff drink and not some 'elevated' bar food** to eat to prevent Hanger.... As mentioned, I have been here a handful of times for a drink, and always enjoyed it. Service was spot on and friendly.  This is a great date place,catching up with somebody or for pre-dinner cocktails.

** like Peter D does,  en homage I'm using the ** because of my bougie statement. If you aren't PDelish, *** Deal with it, this is Yelp!
*** yes , that's my nickname for Pete.

I love this place! It's great for a date and it's romantic. It has outdoor seating and a sleek wood inside. I appreciate their collection of cocktails and samples multiple.

It's very busy and loud over the weekend but it's still worth a visit if you can squeeze at bar.

I keep forgetting they have food so I can't comment on that.

My friend and I were in the area and he told me that we should go here for happy hour. I'm glad to say I did because they do not skimp on happy hour at all lol. We both got a dark and stormy and there was an adequate amount of rum in it and not overflowing with ice which is pretty standard for happy hour drinks unfortunately. Would definitely come back if I happen to be in the area.

This place is a great cocktail spot. It's unfortunate that it's okay for their staff to undermine women....

I took my team to blueprint after a corporate event. A male employee of mine tried to personally pay for a round of drinks and I interjected with the company card. The (I believe) Aussie male bartender thought I was a friend/date when I tried to pay for the bill and refused my card. I tried to explain the situation... He turned to the guy and asked him if he was ok with me paying! I had to argue with him for a good 3 minutes before he accepted my card. Once he finally agreed to re-run the cards, rather than apologize for the confusion, he had the audacity to ask why I had an attitude and  turned to my employee and said ""good luck""! (Still assuming I was a date I presume).

He later stated that he was offended when I called out his actions as sexist....Maybe I'm mistaken, but I have not witnessed any man facing these same obstacles when trying to pick up the tab for his team (or even on while trying to pay for a date) #no #equalpayequaltreatment #idontwanttobepaidfor #ijustwantrespect #RBG

If you're looking for an quiet and intimate spot at this bar, I recommend sitting towards the back by the restrooms. I'm sure sitting in the back patio will be very nice too when the weather gets warmer. I tried the ""Ranga Tang"" which had a very interesting taste. It was a craft cocktail made with a single-malt whiskey, ginger and bitters. It was very different from the rest of the menu. I also tried the ""My Dear Julius"" which was made with bourbon, plum gin liqueur, maple, lemon, cinnamon, orange bitters, egg white. It was such a photogenic drink!!

We decided to also stay here for dinner, since we saw some good food on the menu and did not want to travel so much. We ordered the baby octopus, the chef's choice of charcuterie and we ordered a tomato & cress pizza. All the food was excellent and the service was great. Our waitress kept checking up on us to make sure we were having a great time! I would recommend to try this place if you like craft cocktails! :)

A really great place for a drink and some food.  Came here twice now.  The first time was solely for drinks which were delicious.  We tried one each and were pleasantly surprised by them.

The second time, we came for food and drinks.  This time we got the chicken liver mousse and the cheese/meat board.  Both were delicious!  There was a good amount of food on both that we were both satiated at the end.  The drinks we ordered this time was different than the last time and they were still good.  Great place for a chill night out.

This place is amazing. It's small and kind of hidden, but once you find it, you're in for a treat. They have an incredible happy hour menu. There's also a really cute outdoor area.

Of all their signature drinks, they choose a couple which are $7. The rest are $2 off. Same for the snacks, a couple are specials and the rest are a dollar off.

I had the Smokey marg and it was delicious, similar to the other yelp reviewers. It's an artisanal drink at a beer bottle budget.

I also had the charcuterie plate which was also reasonably priced. $16 for 3 choices. The only thing is the plate could have used a little mustard but the meat and cheese was so good.

Beyond that, the service was amazing. Our waitress was so helpful in choosing what to order and very timely and attentive. Hi

Great drinks. Speakeasy level. Smooth operator was the winner in my book. Also the smoky mezcal cocktail (forgot the name) was really good. The service is above average.

One of my favorite cocktail bars in Brooklyn alongside fresh kills on grand street. We grabbed some seats at the bar and ordered some cocktails. I believe the drink I ordered was called el dorado. I'm not 100% certain on the name but it was a cocktail made with mezcal. Great drink and the showmanship from the bartenders was very cool. Despite being extremely busy, they service was super quick and attentive. Great staff! For the second round, I had some mezcal neat. The mezcal selection was limited, but I'm glad that had some in stock. The environment is laid back but most people are dressed business casual.

Thursday takeaway dinner for two.

4 stars for solid food but 3 stars for service although the host was super nice. Really cute set up for outdoor seating with plants and hooks on the wooden partitions for your bags - chairs/tables are school chairs where the table connects. Very nostalgic.

Ordered a chicken sandwich and the burger which were both delicious! The shoestring fries were plenty but a bit drenched in oil.

A few complaints - the noise of the trains going over every few minutes; the sour server (still gave a good tip even though we took our food to-go) - maybe he was in a bad mood/irritated because of the constant overhead train noise. And I ordered a medium burger and I got medium-well and was missing PICKLES! Where are my pickles???

We had drinks while we waited - paloma was decent. Would be back for takeout again if I was very hungry.

Superfine is now my favorite restaurant in Brooklyn!  Their burger is outstanding but so is everything else I've tried.  It's one of those menus that is tricky because you want to try everything but it's hard to stop ordering your favorites.  The staff is also amazing- they're warm and friendly and treat you like an old friend.  I also recommend picking up items from their grocery, especially the farm fresh eggs and homemade tortillas.

I am temporarily staying in Dumbo during Covid and Superfine is the highlight of my experience.  I look forward to returning when the dining room is filled and there is live music on stage, but for now I am so thankful they're open and making sacrifices to serve the neighborhood!

I have come to this restaurant in the past with friends and loved it but then came in with some friends for a birthday dinner and was pretty disappointed. They were pretty busy however our server did not bring us water for a good 20 minutes after being seated not did he offer to take our drink order until our entire party had arrived.
We kept trying to flag down servers or server assistants but we were ignored by all of them. Finally over an hour later our server took our order.
The appetizer portions were tiny! Not how I remember them being at all. It was a real shame because our bill was close to $300 for a few plates of appetizers that left us all hungry!

The music was good and so were the drinks but they came out after our food did.

Some silverware, glasses and water were missing from our table for far too long so I got up and asked the bar tender for them because our server was clearly too preoccupied with about 20 other tables. Food we never ordered kept being sent to our table and at the end we noticed our bill was completely wrong.

Who is managing this restaurant? The servers need much better training and the chef needs to not prepare tiny portions if this restaurant wants to stand a chance.

It will be a while before I come back. If I ever do it will be at the bar and I won't order anything other then a burger and cocktail.

Everything was great except the fact that it's literally under the train by the bridge. It's soo loud you have to stop talking until they pass. It's literally like every 3 minutes. In any event, this is beyond their control. The drinks were good and the service was lovely. It's still worth it despite the noise

We had the most incredible time here! We were a group of six of a chilly night and needed a place for dinner after walking across the Brooklyn Bridge. Nothing seemed to be open. It seemed kinda like a shady area and we were starting to get worried lol. We were standing right near this place when some guy that was smoking just outside walked in and we heard music! We asked if it was a restaurant or just a bar and he informed us it was a full restaurant. After not finding anything ourselves, we figured we'd try it out and get out of the cold. We had no idea what we were in store for!

They didn't have seating available so we waited and got a chance to look around. The place is funky with ramps and stairs and a stage and there was a live band that played the most fun music as well as Christmas music (we were there in December so it was totally appropriate lol). The servers were singing and dancing and just having a great time. I was so excited and almost didn't even care if the food was any good. I was waiting for a table and already having a great time!

They walked us up the ramp and sat us near the pool table! So fun! We had a great view of the place from where we sat and you can tell everyone was enjoying themselves! A quick scan at the drinks and food menus and our orders were placed. The drinks were a huge hit from the get-go! And the food?! INCREDIBLE! Y'all, I just about licked my plate! I had chicken and spinach and potatoes and ate.it.all!! I mean every bit I could scrape off with my fork! Everyone enjoyed their food and we stayed for quite a while singing and dancing in our seats! You can tell the employees enjoy working there and I'm sure they have regulars! I sure would be if I found myself in DUMBO often!

This will be a must-stop for me any time I'm in NYC!! Can't wait to go back and try something new! I've been telling everyone about it that I know is going to New York! Seriously, it's that good! Great food, great service, great fun and ambiance! Can't ask for much more! Bookmark it and go! Trust me!!!!! (And take me with you!!!!) :D

I came here for a live show. I liked the sunken bar in theory, but the layout was a little odd. You're funneled in single file, it makes it hard to see the music or interact with people. All around the sunken bar area are tables, which made it seem more like a restaurant. The stage area was very small. The owner was encouraging people to dance but there were tables everywhere. Because it seemed to have more of a restaurant layout people weren't really mingling. There was a pool table so that's cool.

I really liked the music they played in-between the bands sets, and I'm not sure if that's their regular music or if they were playing to the crowd for that night: Stray Cats, Chuck Berry, Run Around Sue. I'd come back for something specific.

Where else but at Superfine will you find a great late-night spot with a pool table?

The bartenders here are extremely quick and friendly. Great craft beer and signature cocktails as well.

Didn't try any of their food, but, had a great time listening to great music and beating every challenger in 8ball.

I especially love how clean this place is and how the uneven bar is almost something out of an Olympics gymnastics rendition.

Great ambiance and lovely vibe.

Updated Review (2019)

I can say that this place is now 'super'. An 8-member group of us had brunch here, and I will say that the service and food were definitely top-notch. I do not think there were any complaints within the group about our dining experience. My small complaint is that the live band is a bit loud, but the kids in the restaurant seem to like it. Note: the restaurant is very kid-friendly. Also, I called the restaurant and the hostess, who was working brunch on 9/1, was super (see what I did ;) ), friendly and accommodating.

If you are super hungry at brunch, I would highly recommend getting the pork chops and eggs. Man, that pork chop was HUGE and beautifully prepared.

I do not know about the super part.

I will say that the bar/restaurant has a really cool layout and the decor is very artistic. The place kind of has a fusion between the old and new school in terms of decor. It seems that this place invites a very diverse group of people, which is one of the things that I love about New York (but we are seeing less of in the city).  I did not experience the food here, although the pictures of the pork chops look pretty amazing. Superfine has a very nice list of beers and cocktails, so everyone can find something that they like.

Although the bartenders were very nice, the service could have been a little better. Even though we are sitting at the bar, it seemed like we had to shoot a flare gun in the air to get any of the bartenders' attention. I think that many folks from the neighborhood hang out at Superfine, which is cool, and the bartenders were chatting with them. I mean they weren't extended conversations but it felt like we were waiting a long time to get acknowledged for ordering drinks.

This is my third time here, and the excellence of this place is consistent. I am from the West Coast and make a special trip to Brooklyn just to visit this restaurant. The food is OUTSTANDING and the ambiance is cool. The clientele is a wonderful mix of super gay, to average 30 year olds, to business people.

This is the kind of place that will never ask you how you want your steak cooked, because it's going to come out medium rare... after all, that's how steak should be cooked. If you are picky or finicky or always modify your food, this place is NOT for you. The menu is small like all farm-to-table restaurants should be, and has been different every time I've been here.

The only reason this place gets 4 stars instead of 5, is because the service is not warm and friendly. However, I've sat at the bar all three times I've been here, so I can't speak for the dining room servers. The bartenders act like they don't really care whether you're there or not, and they never check on you after you get your food (probably because they know it's going to be good). But your beer is always full and the food comes out quick. Maybe it's because I'm clearly an outsider? Maybe it's because they're always so busy that they don't need my business? Maybe that's just Brooklyn? Either way, I'm not mad about it.

I will continue to come here because I love it.

We were sent here from Olympia Wine Bar by the bartender, and we are SO glad we listened to her recommendation! They had open mic/jams with the house band, great wine and delicious food. Fun bar ambiance in the sunken bar below the restaurant portion. Loud but fun atmosphere. Great spot for Wednesday night fun in Dumbo!

This was my first time here and it was surely a treat! There was a live band and a nice crowd because of the soccer game. It was a little noisy but given the circumstances of the game, why wouldn't it be? If sound bothers you though that's something to consider because of the live music. The servers and staff were so friendly. I felt comfortable and really enjoyed the atmosphere! The table was constantly checked on. A partner from the restaurant even came over and gave my friend a complimentary drink for his birthday and dessert which was so sweet!!!

Okay now for the food. I got the special pancakes which were cherries. THE BOMB! I really had to slow myself down from eating too fast lol the steak and eggs was also delicious. It was cooked exactly to order. All of the table was satisfied with their food and drinks. I will definitely be back. Such a cute, comfy, and safe spot !!

Sunday brunch review

The food is nothing special, what ppl come here for is the live music. This Sunday feb. 17th they had a band from Alabama, interesting music.

The drinks are watered down and cost just as much as everywhere else. The mojito is lime juice with ice and almost no liquor. However, the pool table comes in handy if you want some healthy competition.

Overall, wouldn't come by here again. Just because the drinks were sucky.
2.5 stars because apart from the live music they have decent beers and the waiters were friendly.

This was a lunch stop, after exploring Brooklyn bridge and Dumbo. It was so incredibly hot so I wanted to find a place to sit inside and chill. My brother found here using google, I have yet to get him to get on the yelp trend.
Superfine is in what looks like a converted wear-house, all the exposed brick is awesome.
They also had a featured artist that was space and Bond girls. In the front there's your traditional bar lots of tables we were placed up at a 2 top away from the middle which was nice to be able to observe the surrounding people and look into the kitchen, I love to watch people cook so it was awesome.
My drink was delicious! It was a Tom Collins but made with gin, refreshingly perfect on a hot day.
Lunch was awesome! I had a fresh vegetable medley, along with a delicious cornbread cake esq thing, I can't remember the specific name but it was delicious! I'll be back the food looked like there were many good choices and I think they have brunch!

This was a nice place to stop for brunch after a morning run in DUMBO. The menu wasn't very extensive or creative, but the prices are fair and the food is good. I especially liked the breakfast potatoes. We were seated up front by the bluegrass duo that was playing, and I thought that added a fun, unique aspect to the brunch.

Superfine might be superfine because it's in Dumbo and by the East River but it isn't all that fine when the food you ask for isn't available and the food itself isn't all that super.

Details:
I came here for Brunch around 1PM with two other friends. It's quite spacious and there's even a stage for live music. Amaze. A band was playing folk / country music and it was really sweet. And our waitress was sweet. But that it is folks - nothing too ""WOW"" ing.

Food is average. The brunch/lunch food is mostly tex-mex feel and good ol' chunks of meat and omelette. They didn't have sausage when I went. The side order of bacon was really disappointing because I could have made juicer bacon at home. My friend who had chicken enchilada said the chicken tasted really fake, but the beans were good. Oatmeal was average. Omelette was mediocre because it didn't have any distinct taste - I had to think why I was eating an omelette that tasted like nothing. The potatoes were good.  My other friend who had pork chops said it was pretty good.

Also, two of the three drinks we ordered weren't available.

It was below average to average feel of an experience.

Came for Sunday brunch and everything was great! Atmosphere, food and music.  One of the owners came around and was very welcoming and warm.  We came during the women's soccer final, so the crowd was great and energetic. It's kid friendly but great if you just want to go with friends or a partner. I had the buttermilk pancakes and they were GREAT!

I would also recommend the mimosa with brunch!

OMG!  Wish I could add 10 more stars to this place.  Had to look for a quick place to eat and nothing in the area was quite as inviting and perfect as this place.  So unassuming.  Had the best rib-eye ever!  And I mean ever!  Cooked to perfection and the sides are bar none mouth watering delicious.

Service is spot on friendly and perfect.  Checked in on us at the perfect time.  Pricing for the quality of the food is just right.  Fantastic selection of alcoholic beverages too.

Bar area is quaint, dining area is plentiful.  Parking is on the street, but was easy for me to find a parking one block away.  Worth it!  Don't walk, run to have a yummy dinner here.  You won't regret it!

Love this place! Been a regular here for roughly 4 years. Know some of the staff. Worked with some of the staff on side projects.

Came in here with a friend recently and had a great time. We paid our tab, I went to the bathroom came back, my friend went to the bathroom, I took a sip of my full water and the older male barback/bartender with the salt and pepper beard on September 29th at roughly 4 pm bussed my full water immediately after I took a sip... I mean I know I paid my tab but I'm not suddenly chop liver buddy... and to take the water away so abruptly and then practically snap a 'thanks goodbye' at me... made it seem like I had stiffed him on the tab or something when I left way over 20% in cash. I'm in the industry, I know what tips mean.

Anyway, we left, toured my friend through my old stomping grounds and came back for a game of pool and enjoyed some of Christina's company which refreshed at least my experience...

Great spot in Dumbo for brunch.

Food was killer and there's a pool table, although I don't know if you can play during brunch. Mens has something for everyone. Nice couple of beers to choose from and full liquor bar.

This place has a feel that the space hasn't changed much since back in the day. I love that. It is right under the bridge,‚Äã so truly Dumbo.

Great location. Awesome decor and staff. Food was good and the drinks as well. We ordered chicken wings and the shrimp tacos. Both which were amazing. Drinks were very good and well made as well. Our bartender was awesome, we didn't appreciate her co-worker coming up to her holding a cigarette as we were trying to have a conv with her to talk about professional issues that were meant for behind closed doors.

Really cool bar ambiance with fun paintings on the wall. The bar area is definitely more of a stand and mingle around.

Made a reservation 3 days earlier and came with 16 people for a large group work event. Even though we were 20 minutes late due to the rainy weather, staff was super accommodating.

They took our app orders, then drink orders, then our entree orders. Everything came out promptly and together, so nobody was left without their order. We did have to shuffle a few plates around so everyone got the correct order, but understandable bc we were a large group. Food was delicious and they have vegetarian and gluten-free options for those with dietary restrictions. The pork chop was amazing. The fries were DELCIOUS (and also gluten-free).

Only hiccup: Given our large group size, there was a 2 person table added at the end. We had 2 people running late. A staff member stopped by multiple times to ask if we still needed the table. However, one of the people running late could no longer make it and there was an open chair at the other end of the table, so we could make do without the added table. The third time the staff member asked about the open table, we initially said we still needed it, but one of our party spotted the open chair at the other end, so we told the staff member they could take the table. The reply was a sarcastic ""No, you clearly need it"", which was the only off putting part about dinner. We were a little surprised given how good the rest of the service was that night. We ended up keeping the table and our late party member sat there, so it was put to use.

Overall, a good experience and thank you Superfine for putting up with a large group.

Enjoyed a delicious produce-forward meal here for my birthday last night. The food was delicious and the service was even better - huge thank you to the lovely lady who made it a meal to remember! I was flattered by efforts to make it extra special with a dessert, happy birthday vocal support and the kind gesture of a drink on the house.... A memorable evening indeed!

Came here for a me date Memorial Day weekend. Kentucky lemonade, (bourbon and sugar on the rim!) and Frittata. Perfect portions. So many places just give so much food, and seriously, how many times do people actually eat their doggy bag leftovers? Also, when you check in, FREE GLASS OF WINE. Come on, how can you loose?? Love the vintage touches too, and fresh flowers!! TREAT YOSELF!!!
(Also, they didn't mind that I brought my half drank iced coffee, some places are weird about that).

Came here on a spontaneous date on Friday and had a wonderful experience. The vibe was super cool and the staff was great. Food was mediocre we ordered the artichoke salad, grilled calamari and fries - we were pretty full on the drinks which were on point. We tried a few of the drinks honestly all of them tasted great you can't go wrong. Def would come here again.

On a rainy Sunday, while visiting Brooklyn, we stumbled upon this ""superfine"" restaurant! So happy we did, as the place is very cool! Great band playing, service was so friendly and our food was pretty dang good, too! Not a huge fan of the Bloody Mary, but I'm in Southern California and it's difficult to beat our Bloody's here;) overall, fab experience and we will return on our next NY visit!

Been going to Superfine since they opened years ago and have always enjoyed it. Have not been there in a while due to friends wanting to try other spots in Dumbo and Brooklyn Heights. I was happy when a friend suggested Superfine for Sunday brunch because I missed the place. I really wanted to write this review to simply say this: After all these years, the food at Superfine is as top notch as ever and the staff is so cool, friendly and warm. With so many restaurants that have difficulty maintaining food quality and service levels over time, it's nice to know that Superfine remains as great today as when it first opened.

I stopped in to Superfine when they first opened. They had another smaller location in the neighborhood they outgrew so I already thought the food was amazing. This space was much bigger and they made the food taste even better. Now about 15 years since I was last there it's just as good! Plus they serve alcohol.

The way they designed the interior around what used to be a loading dock makes it wonderfully unique!

Haven't had a brunch this bad in a while. It honestly felt like brunch from Hell. We came in on a Sunday when they had a live bluegrass band playing. Totally a preference thing, but I personally find this genre absolutely grating. The type of music you start making when you've been in isolation and inbreeding hard. Anyway, this review isn't for music.

The food was just so mediocre! It was mostly generic Tex-Mex fare. Exactly the Mexican food you deserve while you're listening to redneck jazz. Burrito was bland, mostly just over cooked scrambled eggs wrapped in a gummy tortilla and drenched in watery hot sauce. Served with 3 nuggets of unseasoned potatoes. Pathetic. $16, in no universe justifiable. Coffee was dirt water. No one seemed happy with their food. It was just the lot of us, slowly shoveling tasteless, tepid, soft mounds into our mouths. Service was fine though, can't fault them for anything.

Great cocktail menu. Usually drop in for a red hound. Today was my first time having lunch. Great ambience. Got their grouper tacos which I was not a fan of. Staff was very pleasant. Tried their chicken sandwich - delicious. Definitely recommend. Great for groups also. My firm stops in for happy hour and takes full advantage of their pool table.

My husband and I were in search of a place to have our wedding and we decided to book our event with Superfine. The Event Planner, Tanya, was so attentive and informative and she really wanted to make sure we as couple had our input and most importantly she worked well with our budget.

On our wedding day, my husband and I were happy and satisfied with the service. All of our guests had much great things to say about our event: they loved the food, the cake, the atmosphere and how attentive the servers were.

Cool location right under the Manhattan bridge in Dumbo, Brooklyn.  Building had that old-New York, industrial brick character inside and out.  Fun vibe inside.
We went for lunch this damp June saturday, and had reservations, but probably didn't need them.
I love the menu concept -- apparently selections change depending on ingredient availability and sustainability. Thumbs up for that.
Food was good, but I know there's more potential.  My grilled cheese was nice, with spinach and tomato on multi-grain bread, but a little too oily (yes i know it's grilled cheese, but still.)
My wife's portabello sandwich was also a bit on the greasy side.
Service was great.  I'd like to try this place again for dinner or later for drinks.

Three's is a great place to hang out in Brooklyn. We used to come here a lot pre-COVID, and it was veryyy crowded on the weekends, but if you can snag a table then it's a good time.
During COVID, they've made some changes to accommodate the new policies. You can now reserve a spot in the outdoor garden area in the back (entrance on Butler st) OR first come first serve in the front area. We tried to come without a res, and all the tables were filled already.
But making a reservation is fairly easy for the weekend if you do it during the week.

The outdoor backyard is actually really nice with the tables spread out apart. And I think I saw heaters above for when it gets chilly. There's a QR code on the table to order food (NY law, if you're getting drinks). And it's ACTUAL food, not just chips like Finback and Strong Rope)! And then there's a separate place to order drinks.
In general, Three's beers are just aite for me, but the atmosphere and the fact that they sell liquor/wine/other non-beer drinks keep me coming back! We always have a good time here and the fact that it can't get crowded is even better.

Came here after axe throwing with my friends. I have never had such terrible service inside of a place in NYC before. If you're not enjoying your day, go home... Don't spread your negative energy around everyone else.

We had menus on our table and he took some away before we even had a chance to look at it and rudely said ""you guys need 7?"" (Sir; there's 11 of us...)

We asked for extra chairs and he said ""find them the same way you got the rest."" When he came by with food, he said ""who is number 30?"" We told him it was for our table since we had a big group and the number holder was on our table. And then he's like ""yeah but is it yours?"" So my friend said ""yeah it's mine we ordered wings and veggie burger"" and the waiter was like ""yeah I know what's in my hand"" (Umm.. so what did you expect us to say?)

I have never been so disgusted before by someone's attitude.

Thank you but no thanks. The 11 of us will definitely make sure we never step foot here again.

I'm sad to say that I was once a loyal costumer but will never, ever return to this terrible establishment based on the horrible customer service my friends and I received. The employees here were disrespectful and so so so pushy with ordering food that we ordered out of obligation but not desire. We had just came from eating and just wanted drinks. These employees, including the weekend manager, need to calm down. We were speaking Spanish and they asked us to ""quiet down"" like excuse me?! We weren't loud at all but maybe we should of spoken in your native language so everyone could hear how discussed we were with this place.

Bye gurl.

Sneakily hidden around the corner, but such a gem in Park Slope. Skinny, but long storefront extends all the way to a back outdoor picnic table area. Food and beer all in one place!

The bartenders were attentive. The live music was awesome. I don't remember what I got, but I always love when you can get a taster size. I almost grabbed some beer to go as a gift for a friend, but was headed to a broadway show and wouldn't be able to bring it in, but that shouldn't stop you from bringing their brew home.

Stop 2, i think, in our mini brewery tour. A main street kinda place with a nice walkup. There are tables in the front, mainly dining? Maybe. As you walk towards the back you pass the kitchen window and enter the bar area. Nice warm feeling, a dark wood bar. Thats the way bars are supposed to be.

We were greeted quickly, handed a menu and the beer is also displayed on the wall. A couple of pints and we moved yo the outside seating in the back.

It's nice, picnic tables, smaller tables, plenty of room. We were the first back there, late afternoon. I chuckled over a rules sign. Number 1 was no kids after 7. Hmm, then the parents and wee babies started coming in. Lol, i cant blame them, i guess. Wasnt an issue. But they were on the clock.

The food all looked really good, real good. We didnt nosh. Pizza was the plan. NY pizza, sorry Florida.

My favorite beer was ""far between"" an oak aged brew. Very good.

A good place.

Spacious, clean, and classy. I haven't explored this place in its entirety. (Like what's that upstairs space right when you walk in?) But it's clearly a popular spot since I always see so many groups here. The positive spin on this is because they foster a sense of community, like the plethora of weekly events might indicate. And of course an outdoor space that's as close to all year-long as possible is welcome in this concrete jungle. (Could use some more greenery out there, tbh.)

The reason for withholding the final star is simply because I have yet to be blown away by any drinks or food that I've ordered. I guess technically food should be reviewed under a different listing cause the little counter you order food from is / is not affiliated with actual Three's Brewing itself??

Like I've said, I haven't been here enough times to sort that all out, but as summer summer time rolls around again, I'm happy to come through and test out the experience again soon!

(Teacher Appreciation Friday's, feel free to lure me back in anytime!)

I love Threes! I have visited several times, some to just pick up beer and others to stay and enjoy a beer outside.

Threes makes some amazing beers that you need to try. some of my favorites are constant disappointment and unreliable narrator. They have an amazing outdoor space to check out during the better weather months. They also have a separate beer shop to pick up some goodies to bring with you.

All in all 5/5 for amazing space and beer.

Stopped in for a drink with my daughter while in Brooklyn.  She had scoped it out ahead of time.  Walked thru a residential area to get there.  Bartenders were friendly and helpful and quick with service.  They offer different sizes so that you can make your own ""flight"" or get a large one of your favorite!  They had a four person band playing bluegrass music which made for a great atmosphere.   Outside seating was also available and it was a gorgeous day for that.  Good selection of their own brews.  I would return when in the area!

My cousin's choice for our last meal together before I headed out of town.  This place was spread out across a couple of rooms between two levels and an outdoor patio.  We ordered and paid for our food order at the counter near the door  With a number pole in tow, we proceeded to grab a table in the adjoining room where the beer bar was located.

Music plus the ambient noise from all of the people in the room did make it tough to talk.  But there was an unmistakable buzz to the room from the music to the people eating/drinking/conversing around us.  The lighting in the room was a bit dim so it did make it a bit hard to read the beer selection menu.  I was seated at the table so my cousin handled it.

We each both got sandwiches and fries were decent.  The small kitchen that they have turned out good food considering what seems like a lack of space inside their kitchen.

I ended my NYC day with a hazy IPA which was great because I've already consumed too much beer and my kidney/liver were saying no mas.

This place was close to the LIRR station which was where I was headed right after the meal.  Barely made it too as the driver saw me running into the boarding area.  I probably used a lot of karma points that night.

Roomy, good beer, and some food to go with it?  I didn't even have a chance to try their non beer options but I hope I will when I come back to this neighborhood again.

Came here on a bright but cold Saturday afternoon and I'm a big fan of the space itself. The bar is pretty big -- they have a backyard (which was taken over by someone's 30th birthday party the day we went), the main bar area, some sunny window seats in the front, and some back seating up a short flight of stairs (where the Ninth Street Espresso is).

The beers I tried were all pretty good (Logical Conclusion, Crying on the Inside, Unreliable Narrator -- also, who comes up with these names?!), although they all honestly kind of tasted the same to me (I am not a beer enthusiast). The service was a little disappointing, took a long time to get any of the bartenders' attention. I understand that it can take a minute to get to everyone when it's busy, but a little eye contact or a nod goes a long way... please just acknowledge my existence so I know you're coming back to my spot at some point. That said, am already excited to come back here in the summer, when it's warm enough to sit in the backyard.

Brooklyn is a hot bed of breweries and Threes Brewing sticks out amongst them. From the funky tap list to the amazing food they are dishing out Threes must be on your Brooklyn itinerary. Step into the converted warehouse and order food at the walkup window - Farm to table sausage biscuit sandwich was amazing! Tons of flavors I wouldn't have put together myself. The burger was also very flavorful and a good size portion. While you wait for your food, wander back to the bar. 15 beers on tap, mostly theirs, but some of their brewing friends as well. Order a flight and try them all out.

There is a cool patio out back. We didn't sit out there, but had great space and some shade.

Threes is one of my favorite breweries in NYC for a variety of reasons. Lets start with the most important, the beer.

Threes has a nice variety of in house sours, ales, saisons, ipas and darker beers. Something for everyone and they are all tasty. They also dedicate ~25% of their tap list to rotating external breweries often from NYC or NY state. In addition, Threes has two refrigerators filled with bottles and cans of their own beers and hand picked others.

The food: While the brewery doesn't make food, they have a fairly permanent food provider in the Meat Hook who is constantly updating their menu with exciting new options. Expect to always be able to find something like a burger or a fried chicken sandwich among other items. Nachos are definitely underrated.

The space:  Amazing mix of trendy indoor area and outdoor space. All beers can be ordered at the bar or if you want to sit, via table service. Food is ordered at the meat hook counter and they find where you are sitting. The outdoor area is great year round as they tent it during the winter.   The upstairs of the brewery includes a ""coffee shop"" where they serve beer and coffee and can provide a quieter atmosphere if desired. They also have a private room upstairs for hosting parties. We held a birthday party there and it was a great experience. The staff was very attentive to everyone's food and drink needs.

Definitely worth a visit if you are in NYC.

Came here with a page out of the Brooklyn Pub Pass book.

This place looks small from the outside, but it's actually freaking huge! When you first walk in, there's booths on the left for people to enjoy their beer and food. On the right, there is a small kitchen powered by the Meat Hook. After a beer or two, get the pepperoni stick for $5. It's delicious!

The main bar is all the way towards the back. It's decorated with little barrels of beer around it. Across from the bar are more tables for people to sit. There is also an upstairs where they have live music, but we didn't make it up there this time. We arrived around 9:30ish last night and it was packed!

The first beer I started off with was the Threes Wandering Bine. It's orange-y in color, and slightly stronger than other Saisons. I finished it relatively quickly. The next two I ordered after were Blueberry Pop and the Threes Counterpart. I expected the Blueberry Pop to be on the sweeter side when I saw it was brewed with vanilla and milk and sugar, but it was actually really tart. It comes in a pretty dark purple color. The Counterpart was fruity and refreshing. It also had a pleasant floral smell.

My friend ordered the cocktail made with tequila and cinnamon, I forgot the name of it but it was delicious and perfect for that cold night!

The food menu looked interesting but we weren't too hungry because we had just eaten before we got here. When I come back, I definitely want to try what the Meat Hook has to offer and finish off that draft menu.

Great selection of brews at great price points for tasting or a full glass. Not sure about the food, but looked decent for bar food. I recommend trying the sampler sizes on the menu and drink your way down the list until it all tastes the same and then just blindly pick the next.

Had a great time here with friends while I was in town visiting. It felt a lot like the bars we have in Austin, big and outdoorsy, lots of seating, lots of picnic tables.

Drinks were good and the bartender in the back was super nice. Actually everyone who worked there was nice. Will definitely come back if I'm ever in town again and want a cold beer.

We were on a Brooklyn Brewery tour and Threes Brewing made the list.  It was a gorgeous Saturday afternoon and I think there was some race that day where runners could come in with their bib number and get a discount.  Needless to say, the place was PACKED.  The main bar was so full, you could hardly move.  A server told us that we could possibly find seats in the cafe upstairs.

The upstairs area has a very small seating area that is tucked away and is more low-key and quiet.  There is a coffee cafe and also a small bar where you can get beer only.  If you want anything other than beer, you have to go to the main bar.

We found seats for four of us in a back room off the side of the cafe.  It felt a little dodgy upstairs--rickety tables with random chairs, a service entrance of some sort that people kept going in and out of.  But at least we had a seat and it was not as hot upstairs as the other areas seemed to be.

I made a wine run at the main bar.  It took a while to get served with all of those people but I finally succeeded.  But it was not worth my time or effort to go back through that mess to get another glass of wine.  I tried one of the porters from the bar upstairs.  It was good and very reasonably priced.

We wanted to try the food but the line for food and the chaos downstairs made us want to leave and find food elsewhere.  It was an interesting visit.  Maybe we'll come back on a random weekday and try it again.

6/19/2019Hey Angela,

Thanks for checking out Threes and for sharing your thoughtful review.

It seems as if you came on a particularly busy Saturday and had less than a stellar experience. While we do try to accommodate everyone that visits the brewery by featuring 3 different bars with lots of seating, we realize that sometimes capacity is still finite relative to the demand.

With that being said, we'd love to host you anytime you are up for coming back. If you want to give it a shot, feel free to hit us up via email (info at threesbrewing dot com) and we'll be ready for you!

Thanks again,
@threesbrewing

This place has a massive backyard area that is perfect in the summer! Extremely spacious with lots of seating and standing room. Perfect place for a summer night especially once all the lights come on.

They had a killer sour on tap, the Dictator is the People, officially a Belgian saison.

also ordered some food. They only take orders at the front, but they'll bring the food to your number.
Dry aged burger with raclette cheese - on the smaller side but pretty good for a brewery
Order of fries - pretty sizeable
Hot chicken sandwich - fried chicken was not very uniform and honestly a bit difficult to eat

Threes is quickly becoming one of my favorite places in Brooklyn. I used to live in south slope, and would go to other half often. I love other half, because I enjoy IPAs and think other half may have some of the best beer I've ever had. But Threes offers a much broader experience than just very good beer, which it undoubtedly has as well. They offer a lot more varieties and many beers that are not even their own. They also have a fully stocked bar so it has a bit for anyone, you don't have to be just a beer fan. Their space is also more enjoyable. There's a lot more room, more seats, outdoor area, food options, and even live music (which I have not have the privilege of experiencing yet). Overall, this is a great place, with a little something for everyone. Can't wait for the weather to get nicer again to take advantage of the outdoor space.

I had a really bad experience here on a Sunday over the summer. The manager made my friends and I feel soooo uncomfortable. She was very hostile towards us, first staring at us and discussing our party with other staff. I had no idea what she was talking about - there was plenty of room, we weren't loud at all. We were so confused.

After the manager was so creepy, I wanted to leave but we were there for a friend's bday so I had to stay to celebrate her. I have to stress - our party was spending money. We got rounds and rounds of drinks and food. Some people were drinking coffee. I cannot prove this was the reason we were treated so badly, but there were persons of color in our group who agreed that the manager was eyeing us but not other groups... hmmm... I felt embarrassed and annoyed at the treatment. All the service was miserable. The person working the food counter was so hostile, she slammed down my fries on the tray and then spilled. At which point I was like Efff this were leaving. I don't get it but I'm not going to think about it. I just won't ever come back.

Business Owner

11/5/2018Hello Gigi,

This message was just brought to our attention by one of our regular patrons.  It was pretty alarming so we felt compelled to reply...

We're so sorry to hear that you did not have a positive experience at Threes Brewing.  We take hospitality very seriously and it is our job to make you feel at home, which we clearly did not do.  For that we are truly sorry.

That said, your allegations of racial profiling are quite troubling.  Our staff was shocked and dismayed by this accusation and had no recollection of the incident (including our Sunday manager, who, by the way, is a person of color).

If you are open to sharing more info about the episode, we'd love to talk to you. Please contact us (info at threesbrewing dot com) or let us know the best way to reach you.  While we do respect your feelings, we do believe there is at least some level of misunderstanding here.

Regards,
@threesbrewing

Absolutely loved Threes Brewing! If it's a nice day out, grab a seat on the back patio...it's adorable, chill and a great time. Definitely my favorite brewery while in Brooklyn.

I had a 10 ounce pour of Divided Line for $6, a solid 4/5 bottlecap 4.4% sessionable fruity IPA.

I also tried a few tasters ranging in price from $3-4 and enjoyed them all! Arbiter of Fun a 5.2% sour, Touchy Subject a 6.4% IPA, Logical Conclusion a 7% IPA, and Voluntary Exile a 9.2% Baltic Porter to round them out. Not a big brew in the bunch!

Great service, great brews, reasonable prices and a cool ass back patio, yep I'll be back next time I'm in the 'hood.

We recently had our wedding at the Threes Brewing Greenpoint location and it was amazing. The venue at night is beautiful with the large windows in the front. The wood throughout the venue made the pictures look amazing. Alyssa kept everything organized and made us feel comfortable the entire time. At one point before the wedding we realized we had not eaten and she went into the back and made us a small sandwich. Way above and beyond. We had family and friends from all over and many said it was one of the best dinners they have ever eaten ever.
We were extremely stressed leading up to the event but Alyssa also had suggestions on what previous couples had done as far as guest books, card boxes and music. The bartenders were also great and even signed our guest book. If you are planning a somewhat low key wedding in a beautiful space (and delicious beers), this is the place.

Very solid brewery in BK. The food in the late night menu was decent not great so giving it a bit lower but the beer is awesome on tap. Plenty of it. Also wine and cocktails for those not into beer. Lots of tables in the front back and outside. Ideal for a good weather day since they have a big backyard.

Came on a rainy Saturday afternoon.

Meh...something very ""anti-social"" about the feel of this place. Maybe it's the loud concrete atmosphere, or the impersonal feel of ordering and plopping the number sign down where you sit.

$12 for the small brat was a tasty snack.
$12 for the tiny glasses of wine was bordering on overpriced.

I'd sum it up like this, it tries to bridge the gap between the avocado toast generation and everybody else.  i.e. people sitting at the bar and eating and then deciding they're going to move to a booth.
I'm not sure if it's working.  2 bartenders can't handle a full crowd when people want to sample stuff.

If beer is still your thing, then there is something here for you.

If comfort and class is your thing, keep looking.

A place only to get a drink. The food here is a disaster. It was obvious they only have the level of food to feed people so they won't die of starving, or the level of salty fries so u can buy more beer.
The burger use the bread you buy from supermarket and over salty  fries tasted bad oil. And it's super overpriced. The place is no classic itself with not too interesting decoration.

Threes is probably my favorite spot to drink in the city and is a real 5 tool player.

The large, open outdoor space, the warm inside with its spacious tables, the bar itself; Threes wears many different hats. You see this in the beer -- a rotating tap selection, a wonderful to-go section; the food -- the meat hook offerings are great (the aged burger is intense, split amongst a group); there's even coffee.

The layout is a little confusing, but it's forgiven for the sheer variety of ways you can experience Threes.

It's really quite unfortunate that the service here is so awful, since the bar itself is decent. A group of 8 of us showed up on a Saturday around 4pm. The place was already super crowded, so we tried the (covered and heated) outdoor space. A couple of us sat at one of the communal tables while others stood around. It was then that this awful waiter (medium height, black hair) roughly shoved us to get by. He then turns around and says to us, in a rude and confrontational manner, ""I SAID excuse me. I didn't mean to push you, but also, LOOK at the passageway you left me"" (gesturing behind us). First of all, if you want to control the crowded space, talk to your own management, asshat. There were people standing EVERYWHERE. Second of all, how were we supposed to just know that where we were standing was the designated walking path?? It was our first time there.

Asshole waiter aside, we ordered and paid for a Meat Hook burger ($14) but they brought to us a veggie burger ($13). When we stopped an employee walking by and notified him, he told us that he was a busboy and doesn't not handle issues with orders, and that we'd have to bring the dish back to the front of the bar for it to be replaced. We didn't feel like waiting in the crowds, and then wait 20 minutes for them to replace the burger, so we just ate it. It actually wasn't bad-tasting; a little under seasoned, but a little ketchup perked it up.

All in all, good bar, good food/beer, GARBAGE SERVICE.

Two good IPA and great prices at $8 pint and 4 oz pours available for $4. Try as many as you like and hang out here.  It's loud but tons of real estate to bring a group upstairs or out back. Quick service and burgers and choke. Sandwich looked quick good. Open late and offer full bar as well as the dozen or so beer list. Really top notch beer centric bar in the area to get local varieties that are tough to come by at local restaurant to.

Cool spot with great beers.

Vliet is a namesake pils for a reason - dry, crisp, with a slight bitter finish to make you want a second sip.
Logical Conclusion is probably my favorite though, with its super fruity and balanced hops/fizz/smooth mouthfeel. It's a perfect summer brew, really.

Backyard is chill, and food from meat hook looked dope. Wish I saved my stomach for some bites here.

Will be back in the future.

This was my first stop of the evening in beautiful Brooklyn! We had a party of 5 and we found seats right away when we walked in. Very rustic setting! But beautiful marble tables! The noice levels were great we weren't yelling at each other. The selection of beers were huge. You could spend a day there tasting and enjoying.  The had a great food coming out the kitchen! We had spicy chicken wings. They were huge! Plus delicious crispy fries! Highly recommend this cozy place.

I really liked this space! It is huge, and being there on a Friday evening was awesome. Being there on a Saturday night, not so much. I was amazed and how packed it could get, but the beers are awesome.

They have food, beer, a coffee bar upstairs, a patio, merch. I dig it.

There are a nice selection of beers to suit all tastes (especially if you don't loooOoOOove IPAs like everyone else), and the beer names are hilariously good.

It was a little confusing when walking in if we could snag a table but you can, which is nice. I like a place that just does bar service and that's it. That's what bars should do.

I came here with the fiance because of the beer and I was hungry and saw they have food by the Meat Hook which is from my hood and Meat Hook has never disappointed me.

The beer was good I had a few of their house draft beers called ""Here Ya Go"" that's described as Capri Sun, Gooseberry, Kiwi, Apricot, Dank Finish. I had a medium rare burger (because that's how I like it) from the menu and fries, it was a small burger, to me it looked like an upgrade from a slider, maybe a jumbo slider. Guys, I need more burger for $17, I need carbs to sustain more carbs from beer! My fiance devoured his burger in 2-3 bites but had way more beers than I did.
Anyway, the space is actually really amazing, it actually looks awesome to throw a party in although I'm not sure if they even cater to that sort of thing. I would go back for beers in their back yard when the sunshine decides to come through in the near future.

Hubby and I recently went bar hopping in Gowanus and checked out Threes Brewing on a rainy Sunday afternoon. We waited for the rain to stop to enjoy the outdoor patio. It's pretty cool and there are a lot of great beers on tap.

However, my negative rating has to do with the shady cashier at the food station, otherwise known as ""The Meat Hook."" When I ordered my $14 veggie burger using my credit card, she cheerfully entered the information but also sneaked in a $3 tip for herself without my knowledge. I didn't know this until after I signed the iPad and got the receipt emailed to me. I usually tip servers in cash, so I was appalled.

I'm posting this so that others be warned of this kind of shady behavior whenever you order anything from the ""Meat Hook"" window. Pay with cash or double check the amount BEFORE you leave that cashier window. And WATCH that cashier's tapping fingers before he/she swivels the iPad around for you to sign.

In all my years going to eateries that use iPads for payment, I've never experienced something like this. Apparently meat is not the only thing that gets ""hooked"" at the Meat Hook, where all the privileged Brooklynites are too busy getting drunk to notice they're being fleeced. But as a penny-wise Queens resident, I sure as heck ain't coming here again.

Comment from Josh S. of Threes Brewing

Business Owner

6/5/2019Threes Brewing is a separate company from The Meat Hook, however, they are our business partner and take customer feedback as seriously as we do. Below is a note from their General Manager.

__________________________

Hi Jennifer,

Thank you for taking the time to write to us about your visit to our restaurant. I want to sincerely apologize for the negative experience you had and the customer service you received. As a business, customer satisfaction is our top priority here at the Meat Hook, and I am so sorry we failed to uphold our high hospitality standards in this situation.

Regarding gratuity, tipping our staff is always optional. Please note that our point of sale system, not the cashier, has a default gratuity in place for credit card payments; however, if customers don't want to leave a tip or if they want to change the tip amount, they have the option to do so directly on the screen. Our cashiers are trained to inform customers about this step of the transaction, but based on your review it is clear that she did not properly communicate this to you. I assure you we value and appreciate our customers and their hard-earned money, and none of our employees would intentionally steal from patrons. I do see, however, how our lack of clear communication in this instance created a ""shady"" situation and caused you to feel taken advantage of. Please know that we are taking your feedback to heart and will take every action necessary to resolve this issue; additionally, because of your thoughtful review, we are re-examining our gratuity system and working on implementing a more transparent method moving forward.

We would love the opportunity to serve you again and regain your trust. I would also like to refund your bill from the day in question. Please reach out to me directly charity at the-meathook dot com so we can get this taken care of.

Again, thank you so much for taking the time to bring this to our attention. We are always looking for ways to improve and your thoughtful review gives us the opportunity to learn from this experience and to make changes to be the best we possibly can.

Hope to hear from you soon.

Best,
Charity

Had SUCH a great experience here! The beer menu is extensive and the names are really fun! My boyfriend and I got a bunch of 5-oz pours (I wish they had actual flights because it was hard to keep track of the beers we were trying!) and they were all exceptional. We both agreed that the Short Fuse was our definitive favorite, because we could actually taste the smokiness and it was so interesting without being overly ~fancy or anything! It was so fun to try all of the beers & to look for the crazy tasting notes that they had put in the menu. To add to this really fun time, our bartenders were exceptional and were happy to help with recommendations and also with keeping track of which beers we had and hadn't tried. All-in-all, had such a great time here and cannot wait to return.

Winter Sunday not too crowded. Service ok. Solid solid hoppy pils called Vliet!  The pale ale is one of the orange juicy tasting haze ales which I am not a fan of but if that's what you're into it's a good style.
Friendly staff. Good vibes.

Excellent vibes at this brewery.  Ambience was just what you are looking for on a Sunday hanging out with friends.  Pitchers galore and conversation buzzing, the beer list at this literal hole-within-a-wall-within-a-wall has all of the various hops and tastes the everyday drinker can enjoy.  Take enough sips of their ""the world is flat"" concoction and you will literally begin to see your world becoming flatter and flatter.

Food here was iffy for me on the other hand.  I ordered a fried chicken sandwich that was delicately cooked yet the choice of which actual part of the chicken did not settle with my taste buds nor my stomach.  Chicken thighs are delish, but not great on a sandwich.  Don't forget about the breast yo.

For sure will come back.  This is what breweries are all about.

In these times where outdoor dining is key, it's nice to find a place with as creative a backyard patio as Bricolage. Filled with plants and shelves lined with old-school portable TVs, it's quirky and lush all at the same time.
We came for brunch. The service was great, the staff very friendly, and they were mindful of COVID and the heat, making sure we were comfortable.
The food was awesome. Start with their Crispy Imperial Rolls. Then roll onto their Chicken & Waffles, which doesn't lack crisp or flavor. There's a layer of seasoning/sauce between the breading and chicken that takes it to new levels. Around our table, the Breakfast Bahn Mi, Pork Belly Hash, and the Avocado Toast all got a thumbs up too.
Will definitely be back for their dinner service soon.
Please support your local businesses!

One of the best outdoor dining experiences you can get during these COVID times - the worst part is how popular it is! We came on a Friday night around 6pm and had to wait until 7 to get seated so I would recommend making a reservation or coming right when it opens. However, if you have the time, I would say the food and dining experience was well worth the wait.

Here are the items we tried:

Drinks (not pictured):
- Thai-basil lemonade: 4.5/5 - Much more sour than sweet but very fresh and balanced the food well
- The Stroller: 5/5 - Delicious, sweet, and fruity!

Mains:
- Unshaking beef: 5/5 - Hands down my favorite item we ate. It was an enormous piece of steak that was perfect for sharing between 2 people (definitely would have had leftovers if I ordered it for myself) and came with a bowl of rice and tangy salad that complemented the steak perfectly.
- Spice garlic noodles: 4/5 - Both my friend and I thought this was too spicy for our taste (as people who can take mild-moderate spice) but the flavor of the noodle and shrimp were amazing. The portion was also a bit small.

Dessert:
Five spice plum cobbler: 3.5/5 - The homemade matcha ice cream had such a deep authentic flavor but it was not sweet at all, which didn't help counter the tartness of the plums. The crumb was a little sweeter but I wasn't really a fan of the texture either. However, this may just be my personal taste - if you like your desserts on the less sweet side, you may enjoy this!

Overall, an amazing experience and I definitely would come back again.

Visited during covid/quarantine times.

Was walking in the neighborhood and the outdoor decor lured me in. Ordered the avocado toast with poached egg  and breakfast bahn. Also got two mimosas. The mimosa were tasty. Not too strong and a bit on the sweet side. The service is great. The food took a little while but we weren't in any rush so we didn't mind. They have a couple of outdoor seating.

The avocado toast was amazing. The pickled carrots were a great added taste. The breakfast bahn was also great but it wasn't filling.

The prices were a bit much for a small amount of bahn.

Would love to come to this place once dinning services are back up and running.

I've been fortunate enough to enjoy the superior food, thoughtfully and imaginatively (in the non-""Six Degrees of Separation"" Will Smith thesis on ""Catcher in the Rye"" way) crafted cocktails, urbane environment, cool ambience, well-lit brick-walled space, balmy outdoor seating area, and excellent kitchen staff at Bricolage.  The waitstaff, however, deserves special attention.  Having worked in the hospitality and service industries since, well, the age of 7, it's my opinion that everyone in America should work in one, the other, or both.  For the servers to be able to navigate such a narrow passageway as the bar area (the only real, but un-fixable as of my too-long-ago last visit issue) with nimble and smiling dexterity is a feat worthy of the New York City Ballet.  Pas de Calais took less time to plan.

The fact that they BEGAN with a chef from the fabled Slanted Door in San Francisco (which I've visited many times) says a lot about the vision, gravitas, and creativity with which the owners infused their venture and the menu. There were no retreads from that famous bill of fare.  New flavors, less precious menu, and palpable energy for the collaboration pours over the palate.  Every time I went the joint was slammed but the atmosphere was convivial, whether you wanted a warm glow for a romantic evening or a solid neighborhood (or destination) spot for a group gathering.  Rather like Caf√© Le Procope in Paris, in a way.  The restaurant business is a tough one, and only profitable if scaled.  So this is a successful labor of love. Yet the partners generously give their space, treasure, and commitment to local and international philanthropic causes time and time again.  If I were cool enough to live in that part of New York, it would be my Cheers (in the best sense).  But it's worth an equally long journey there from the UES as it was to go to Pastis when it was in its old location.  If ever there were a truly local business with cosmopolitan panache, it was and is Bricolage.  Run, Via, Subway (worth changing trains!), or wheelbarrow yourself there ASAP.  Just save me a table this weekend.  And be sure to ""overtip"" (that means 25% MINIMUM these days, y'all) your waitstaff and the driver who got you there.

I definitely fell for this place for its cute decor, especially the backyard patio which screamed 'stay here if you want to be warm and cozy.' Here are some good and not-so-great takeaways from my dining experience on a Saturday night:

The good:
- Dining in Park Slope is a nice little adventure no matter what time of day.
- COVID restrictions are taken seriously. You're given hand sanitizer right before you're seated.
- The staff is super friendly and accommodating. Even after closing they let us come back to use the restroom.
- The drinks are great. I had the G-G's Brother, which was a mix of tangy, sweet, and bitter, and left me feeling *good* all through dinner.

The not-so-great:
- My friend and I shared the shrimp claypot. I pictured something really big, but unfortunately it turned out to be a small pot with a few pieces of shrimp, baby Bok Choy, cherry tomato, and scallion. I guess the caramel-chili sauce sealed the deal, but I was not at all impressed by this dish...I guess I'll order something more 'Vietnamese' next time.

I recommend coming here for brunch the first time, since the brunch menu looks a lot more promising than the dinner one. Either way, the drinks, service, and decor were enough to bring me back again.

It's hard to compare Bricolage to any Vietnamese establishment, mainly because it doesn't feel like one. Vietnamese customers, let alone staff, aren't really much of a thing here (#1), but the despite the overly western vibe, the Asian undertones are really exuded through the food. Their contemporary take of Viet inspired cuisine is impressive, just as it is delicious.

Their ties to the famous Slanted Door of SF fame (#2) suddenly make more sense when it comes to their approach. This isn't the homey kitchen with a Viet grandma making bun bo hue or thit kho, but a more high end approach to highlighting Asian flavors through the lens of a western palate.

The casual interior is unintentionally hipster yet the smells coming from the open kitchen is an excellent surprise. They've also beefed up the outdoor seating with an array of beautiful greenery and some interesting retro (#3) decor on top of it. There isn't a ton of seating but they've managed to do a good job to accommodate small'ish groups for some quality dining.

In terms of the food, it's all pretty tasty. The imperial rolls (cha gio) at $15 might feel steep despite ""heritage pork"" upgrade, and similarly to the summer rolls (goi cuon), the portions are modest at best. The quesadilla sized Vietnamese pancake (banh xeo) is a bit of a sticker shock at $25, but is certainly no less aromatic and full of flavor. The real winner is the fish sauce which is pungent and even a little sweet. While I would venture to the five spice wings ($14) and pork belly buns ($18) admittedly feel gimmicky, they're worth considering for those who love it.

I think my favorite entree is easily the unshaken beef ($33) which is their atypical take on bo luc lac. It is delightfully juicy and as a steak type dish makes any carnivore happily satisfied. I also have high regards for the lemongrass pork chops ($20) and pan seared scallops ($33). The pho bo ($18) and pho ga ($18) are personally less exciting and I'm hoping the cloudy broth was a one time deal.

They also have a brunch that I still have yet to dive into. The thought of eating chicken and waffles at a Vietnamese spot sounds interesting, if not somewhat random, but that's the magic of spots that defy conventional notion. Service is on point and I think for folks looking for something a little different will find it in Bricolage.

Visited during COVID times -

It is a great restaurant for big groups to hold mini gatherings. From start to the end, the staff was very attentive and made sure to give us hand sanitizer before entering the restaurant. There is very instagram worthy backyard that was filled with greenery and old radios. The cocktails were mediocre and it wasn't anything special. My favorite was the roasted chicken and the spring rolls. The chicken was tender and juicy and the spring rolls were crispy and full.

Thank you for the amazing service and making my group feel welcomed!

Such a pleasure eating at this place. Usually a large portion of food already makes me happy, image how happy I am when I get a large portion of the GREATEST FOOD EVER, and especially when the place is so gorgeous. Oh, especially when their servers are the cutest.
I am in totally in love with this place, aiming to try all the food on the menu.

Impeccable staff. Food is tasty but expensive for what you get. Good for the strip. I would go back,  but you can get better for half the price in Chinatown but no cocktails & wine.

My boyfriend and I arrived shortly before the kitchen closed and they were nice enough to allow us to sit as long as we promised to have our order ready for when seated, We happily agreed and were in business . It was my first time at this establishment but definitely won't be the last. I enjoyed everything from the food to the staff. Literally everyone was sooooooo nice and the food was tasty . The bar tender was even kind enough to ask my preference of drink preparation, I ended up going with his recommendation because at this point I felt like family and knew he cared for his work.

I will definitely will be coming back with my girls ‚Äç.

I'm sorry to say that this was a very disappointing experience even with rating leeway given for ordering delivery instead of eating at the restaurant. I can forgive the incorrect bread used for the banh mi and the cold imperial rolls but I haven't had such sudden onset food poisoning since traveling to India. I was guilty about not working out before dinner but I guess Bricolage solved that problem for me. Right now, I don't imagine a universe in which a friend will be begging me to try Bricolage and I'll be placed in a position of compromise. I think if that scenario were to ever arise (given this hellscape of a year, all bets are off as to what could happen), I'd stick to gin at the bar. Two stars back for the flavor of the Brussels sprouts but I still think I'll pass.

One of those places I have passed by a thousand times. I am kicking myself for waiting so long to actually try it. My girlfriend and I were out for a walk and decided to place an order, continue our walk and pick up our food on the way back to our apartment (probably about 20 minute walk away from the restaurant to give a sense of how the food preserved).

I went with the spicy garlic noodles while my gf opted for the shrimp claypot. First indication that this place was great was not only were the staff super friendly but they also were very helpful in making a decision as to what to get, and they were spot on. The food lasted perfectly fine. Hot, fresh, no leakage, happy customers. My chicken dish was incredible. Very fresh and high quality ingredients. Not too overwhelming, but had an amazing garlic flavor with just enough kick. Didn't leave a single bite left. The shrimp was equally as delicious, and again very simple with just the right combination of flavors and heat. Will not be making the mistake of waiting too long for the next time we eat here.

I can not rave about this place enough. Came here for dinner on a weeknight and ate in the plant adorned garden. Service was excellent, drinks were superb and the food was dish after dish of delicious tastiness. We ordered tons of appetizers, a few mains to share and while I was so full by the end of it all, I honestly wanted to try the rest of the menu. This place is that good! You will not be disappointed.
These are the kinds of places that make New York and particularly Brooklyn known for their eats. It's uncompromising in all the elements that matter - delicious food, good vibes, excellent service and comfortable atmosphere.
Thank you for a beautiful evening.

Things we ordered and loved:
Papaya salad
Summer rolls
Imperial rolls - omg amazing!
All the tacos ... seriously amazing
Spicy garlic noodles
Shrimp Claypot
All the desserts - particularly the plum cobbler with the chocolate cake following close behind

10000% RECOMMEND!!! Loved the food, cocktails, service, and conversation from the owners and hosts. We had a massive birthday party last minute AND on a Saturday night (their busiest night) in the middle of a pandemic. Not only did they accommodate the party and give us a massive part of the patio from 7-close, they didn't require any minimum charges or booking fees. The outdoors patio was GORGEOUS, like a piece of paradise. The internal design is masterful, the plants colorful and give the place life. Perfect ambiance for a couple or a large group. We tried almost everything on the menu and everything was GREAT.

They were also extremely helpful in pulling together a surprise for the birthday boy. They organized the candles and took out the cake at the perfect moment to help us celebrate.

Overall, wonderful experience. Highly, highly recommend.

I went there on a Saturday for brunch. The decorations are really cute and this place would make a great daring spot (check the backyard).

HOWEVER, the menu isn't really Vietnamese food. You could says most dishes are classic American dishes with a slight inspiration of Vietnamese cuisine. This is very true for the brunch menu.

We had the pork belly hash and the avocado toast (none of the brunch items are Vietnamese food). The pork lacked cruelly of seasoning and the dish itself was very oily. The avocado toast had some pickled carrots and daikon, for the Vietnamese-inspired part. But the pickles were.... Not pickled long enough.

Also, I asked what was the Vietnamese crepe on the menu. It was a vegan crepe with 2 eggs on top.... Lol

Would not recommend for food but drinks in the back patio is to check (though the drinks looked overpriced... $15).

Bricolage has one of the most incredible backyards I've ever seen. Our three friends and I had an exceptional, gorgeous experience.

Our food was thrilling, top to bottom. Particular highlights were our cocktails: the Thai basil gimlet and the GG boy, the apps, particularly the mushroom wontons, and the garlic noodles.

We would love to eat there again in the future. Two notes: definitely call in to make a reservation in advance, and note there is a time limit on the table (at least on Saturday nights in the backyard), we had to leave our table after an hour and a half.

Decent Vietnamese food in a gastropub setting. The flavors were a bit more muted than traditional Vietnamese food. For example, the Cup of Pho's flavor was mainly salt, rather than the complex broth I'm used to. Additionally, the only detectable flavor in the Papaya Salad was the fried onion condiment.

Despite this, the peanut sauce for the summer rolls was phenomenal! Among one of the best I've had - I wanted to eat it plain with rice at the end. The lemongrass tofu dish was really the only familiar flavors I'm used to at home and my girlfriend said it was her favorite dish that night.

As highly priced and Westernized as it is incongruously authentic in ambience (lively, bustling, casual).

I felt that the food erred heavily on the sweet side of the palate and loathed to notice that there were few Asians, let alone Vietnamese people in the house...not that conspicuous attendance by a favorite trendy restaurant by Asian/Vietnamese people would NECESSARILY predict a five-star experience, either, in this town.

I don't consider three stars a bad review, by the way, and take solace in knowing that this place will continue raking it in one way or another, and honestly deserves to do so after having survived the sudden-death business zone of Brooklyn that is Park Slope.

But let's put it this way - I wasn't able to find any culinary escape from the awkward first date I was on, and have not been back since.

This place was phenomenal. They have a backyard patio that is absolutely beautiful with a ton of plants, great distancing and amazing ambience. You forget that you are dining during Covid times.  The service was top notch as well and our waiter was attentive and helpful. The Thai basil gimlet was high quality and refreshing. We ordered the summer rolls, papaya salad and pork belly taco. All were excellent. The summer roll and papaya salad were incredibly fresh and delicious but the winner was the pork belly taco and the sauce that came with it. Will be returning to explore the menu further.

I have been wanting to come here for a long time, and I tried several times on a weekend but without a reservation, it just isn't practical-at least an hour long wait.

I finally got in on a weeknight and really enjoyed the vibe. The service was lacking some, but nothing terrible. They were attentive in asking for food allergies and seemed willing to work with us.

There felt like a large proportion of seafood on the menu, which I only noticed because my friend doesn't eat seafood so options were limited.

We started off with the summer rolls, which were good, pretty standard-the peanut sauce was the star of the show, we had to ask for more.

I like that they have a seasonal menu.  For entrees we got 5-Spiced Duck Cassoulet which I felt was pretty underwhelming, not much flavor. The star of the show was the pork belly (isn't it always, though?!) in the Pork Belly Claypot. The pork was incredibly juicy and the flavor was en pointe.

I didn't have a cocktail but the options looked great-some kind of basil martini that I will have to try!

The hidden secret garden patio in the back is to die for!! And for people The people concerned with mosquitoes or fighting bugs for food, no worries. I think we saw one bee, but after a few attempts on his life ... he got the idea

In total there are only four real tables on the patio and then some kind of couch situation (one of the tables can seat up to 7/8 ppl). There's three makeshift cramped tables in the front in an attempt to bring in more business...pass-Wait for the garden.  We went on a Sunday for dinner and had to wait maybe 30 minutes for a table on the patio. No reservations accepted.

We had the crispy wings, the imperial rolls, garlic noodle bowls, and shrimp tacos. The wings were basic nothing good or bad-they came with an unexciting sauce on the side, the tacos are filling (I think there were two medium-sized shrimp in each taco),  the imperial rolls were delicious (suppper crispy.. thick crispy) and the garlic noodles have a hidden kick at the end of every bite, but definitely good. I think we expected a little bit more flavor in the dishes overall, but it was definitely good and we will return!

The customer service was par at best, but between covid and it basically feeling like the end of the world, I'll give them a pass. Stop by!!

The food was great, very tasty and unique. The COVID precautions seemed good at first: sanitizer given upon seating and a contactless menu. They have a lovely garden  that is nearly but not quite as packed as usual (they leave the middle seats open at the big middle table) as well as street-side seating in 5th Ave., which was closed. But then I saw that the guy doing the plating had his mask around his chin, leaving his nose and mouth exposed indoors. Moreover, the credit card transaction was pre-COVID style, even with a likely germ infected pen. The service was alright but somewhat distracted, even though no one was dining indoors.

Eat here if you are looking for tasty, guiltless food!  The interior is small and rather dark, so if the weather permits, definitely sit out back in their lush outdoor garden area.  It's peaceful and cozy.
The menu is simple and reasonably priced. I had the beef vermicelli.  It was very fresh and tasty.  The dressing was sweet with just a teeny bit of spice, so I added sriracha. The perfectly grilled beef was neatly placed on top of the noodles and fresh carrots, slices of zucchini and fresh herbs.  Would love to return to try more items from the menu!

Super upset at this restaurant! :( I was looking forward to vietnamese food but I was so disappointed. I ordered the summer rolls, which was good as it always should be. I was looking forward to the vermicelli dish that I seen on yelp but they didn't have it. So I ordered the shrimp claypot which was definitely not worth the price. It was about 5 pieces of shrimp and was full of all the other ingredients (onions and tomatoes). I ordered the chicken wings because I wasn't fully satisfied and as plain as they were, it was probably the best dish out of everything I tried. The only exceptional thing was that the bartender created a drink for me that was similar to the Rosemary's baby but instead of tequila, he put vodka and it was good! Definitely not worth what the total amount was...

Outstanding meal! The cocktails are creative and delicious. The small plates are varied and imaginative. The Nom Nom Beef was unique. The service is attentive. The room is comfortable. Usually I'm pleased I'm if there is onE cocktail or dish that makes me want to return. I have at least 5 reasons to want to return to Bricolage.

Pre covid my wife and I would come here regularly. Current covid we order delivery. The menu is a little different now, but still delicious. We are both vegan and this restaurant definitely has some amazing dishes and are willing to make adjustments to existing dishes to accommodate. Really really great. Looking forward to going back soon. Personally I like spicy and think the flavor of the food here is fantastic.

Absolutely gorgeous brunch. Sat outside in the roadway seating on a Saturday when the block was closed to traffic. Cool breeze on a sunny day, it was perfect. There is a back lush yard too but we fancied the street. The salmon eggs Benedict was perfectly cooked and the chicken and waffles. Fresh basil lemonade to wash it down was delicious. There were some yummy looking cocktails and drinks but we were working! Don't miss out it was a really great experience all around. Hand sanitizer available. Then wandered down the street to shop!

I had the unshaken beef Banh Mi and it was delicious! The texture of the beef was incredible. It broke down perfectly with the soft and crisp baguette (which was, as it should be, the star of the sandwich).

I ate at their sidewalk seating. The crew was very strict about their COVID procedures. They sanitized the table before my friend and I sat down. Masks always required. They had sanitizer at the register as well.

On Sept. 20 me and Jerry had dinner in the beautiful garden of bricolage. We had crispy imperial rolls, Vietnamese crepe, and bouillabaisse which were all incredibly delicious and the atmosphere was unique and magical! Unfortunately, I left my pocketbook in the restuarant that evening. The next morning they responded to my post on IG and asked if I left my pocketbook. I told them I was leaving that afternoon for a month and even though the restaurant is closed on Mondays they were kind enough to comedown to gave me my pocketbook  Thank you so much for your kindness and we'll see you soon!

This place was a DREAM! The outdoor back patio is gorgeous with lots of greenery and vintage touches everywhere. The also have seating set up on the street and sidewalk in front. Called at 2pm on a Saturday and we got their last reservation for the evening! Definitely plan ahead and make a reso if you have a party of 4 or more!
The drinks were phenomenal, I got the Vietnamese Gin & Tonic; my friend got their seasonal drink: The Transistor, and my other friend got GGs Brother. We all loved our drinks and ordered another round.
We started with the Crispy Imperial Rolls and they were awesome and just the perfect size to split with 4 people.
For entree we got 2 chicken B√°hn M√¨, a pork B√°hn M√¨, and the spicy garlic noodles.
Everything was delicious! Can't wait to eat here again!

Pros: cool vibe, good service, good cocktails
Cons: the bahn xeo was burnt, freshness of Vietnamese food felt overpowered by fried flavor, felt a little overpriced for quality

Would go back to try different food and give another shot

Came here on whim after a workout class with my friends - we arrive at around 1:15PM and there was no wait for 3 people so we sat down.

The place is pretty spacious, but the tables that share the wooden bench can get very cramped, j struggled getting into my seat without feeling like I was accidentally shoving the girl sitting at the next table.

I ordered the spicy lemongrass shrimp vermeicelli, one fried ordered the spicy beef noodle soup and the other ordered the papaya salad with spicy shrimp and we got French fries to share as a side. One big complaint: it took almost 25 minutes before our food was served. My vermeicelli was fine, nothing crazy mind blowing, definitely need to drizzle the fish sauce in. My friend's spicy beef noodle soup had some very fatty pieces of skin which she did not enjoy, and it was pretty spicy. The other friend's papaya salad was acceptable. I think we weren't crazy impressed by the food because we ended up waiting so long. The fries to share were good when warm, but when it cooled down, I tasted like frozen French fries that were reheated up.

Lastly, it took time for them to get us our bill, but also, getting our cards for them to process took even longer. I was genuinely confuser because by the time we paid, the restaurant emptied out.....why the slow service?

Overall, I wouldn't say the food was terrible but the service could really improve. I would not recommend coming here for a ""quick"" bite.

Went with a group of eight tonight. When I called the day before to see if they could accommodate our party, they could not have been nicer, and asked if we could come in at 5:45PM instead of 6:00 so they could shuffle some tables.

Service from start to finish was excellent and attentive. And the food is always so, so good.  We ordered the crispy sweetbreads, deviled eggs, Summer rolls, vegetarian Summer Rolls, Shishto peppers, Vietnamese crepe and Imperial rolls as starters. I know. But everyone wanted to try everything.  Highly recommend the sweetbreads.  I wasn't crazy about the pork belly in the summer rolls but the peanut sauce was great. I wish I had let the Imperial rolls cool down a bit, but I would happily return just to order them again. They're like crispy egg rolls with a very hot and tangy sauce served with butter lettuce and mint.

For entrees we ordered clay pot shrimp (super spicy but tangy and delicious),  5 Spiced Duck Cassoulet (another dish to return for), Branzino, Lemongrass tofu, Shaking beef and banh canh noodle.

Go with a group. Everything on the menu was really flavorful and well spiced. Not a single complaint from this crew.  I didn't have room for dessert but the bread pudding and the molten chocolate cake with gorgonzola were big hits.

The bill with drinks was $80 a head, which was totally worth it. Our waiter was really top notch.  Even without a reservation, Bricolage would be worth the wait. Can't wait to go back!

Love this place. We have been half a dozen times in the last year. Food is hands down amazing and deserves 5 stars. Summer rolls are very fresh, the Imperial roll (basically a fried summer roll presented with lettuce and mint to wrap around the roll) is a guilty pleasure. The crepe is outrageously good - a crispy fried crepe stuffed with fat noodles and shrimp with a nice dipping sauce. Papaya salad is a nice, healthy antidote to the crepe.

We ordered the ribeye steak (Unshaking beef - get it, you're welcome) , the pork belly and a noodle dish last night, each of which I would have happily ordered again, and possible should have.

Desserts were nothing to write home about. A maple walnut pecan pie (but they only had 2 slices left so I didn't get much of a taste) and an awful tapioca pudding with grass jelly - seriously do not order it. It's dessert sadness.

Service has always been a little spotty. Friendly but not all there. And for that I take off a star. I also find it a bit grubby.  I used to go here when it was Brooklyn Fish Camp and I feel it hasn't really been scoured since that time.  The outdoor patio area reminds me of my hippy friends who have cats roaming all over their apartment, and are really into Buddha statues and candles. It needs a little spiffing up but you can overlook the d√©cor because the food is really pretty great.

Overall a really good dining experience in a bistropub with a really good vibe. Pros: the large dishes are great to share, super flavorful and cooked super well. Loved the side dishes and comp'd rice too. Con: some of the apps missed the spot (the chips for example, not a lot of flavor and tiny portions), and some of the cocktails were too strong on the alcohol/not super balanced. Staff is very friendly, however we were seated literally a couple inches away from the couple next to us, it feels cramped.
The outside garden/patio looked beautiful and we'll try that next time.

We had a really pleasant lunch here.  I got the Vermicelli w/ Beef, and it was a nice cut of beef that was cooked perfectly to medium rare.  The veg and fish sauce with the Vermicelli were quite nice, lots of rich flavors.
My wife got the Pho Ga and also thought it was good.  Lastly we shared a vegetarian summer roll, which came with a delicious peanut sauce.

Service was reasonable, the food didn't come out super quick, but not annoyingly slow either.  From what I could see there were only 2 people working (1 cook and 1 server), so the speed at which they operated was actually pretty impressive.

Bricolage is a charming restaurant with a modern take on Vietnamese cuisine. The restaurant has outdoor spaces (a patio and a terrace) and is open at the time I am writing. The patio, created by an artist, is particularly unique and charming. Dining there feels like peaceful retreat away from the city. We organised a small event in the patio and the restaurant management was very friendly and professional. Our guests had a great time and we received a lot of compliments on the food and beautiful atmosphere of the evening. Thanks to all the Bricolage staff!

Overpriced, one flavor, spicy. Hiding the flavor of all the food under a ton of spices does NOT make it good, it just burns your mouth.

I get it, attendance is down in restaurants. That doesn't mean that anyone that DOES come to your restaurant needs to make up for all the money you'd normally make.

Dinner for two WITHOUT alcohol should NOT cost $65. A banh mi should not be what they charge for it. It's ridiculously overpriced and has exactly one flavor, spicy.

Save your money for better food at a decent price.

I have been spending some time in Battery Park cat sitting for a friend who is stuck on the West Coast for the pandemic.

Fraunces has been a staple for me. The food is exceptional, the whiskey option more so. The staff is topnotch as is the efforts to maintain safe distencing for their diners.

A must have is the pretzel and sliders - a great combo.

What is the catch? Well, to be honest - the house band on the weekends. I can't begrudge a band for giving it their all - but they are not the main attraction - they are background music. We would be much better off if your amps when up to 4 ... and not eleven.

We made a reservation for a Saturday night and I'm glad we did! It was busy. Overall we had a good experience, though we did feel like they could have done a better job with social distancing....

My partner enjoyed his salmon sandwich and I enjoyed my lobster mac + cheese. His hot apple cider was delicious! I tried a pumpkin beer the server recommended and was very happy.

I'm so glad that this restaurant is still open during COVID.  The food and the service are great.  The outside seating allows you to appreciate the beautiful 18th century building. I highly recommend Fraunces Tavern.

We found this spot while walking around the financial district in NYC and we are glad we did.
Service was good. Food came out quick and the hostess/waitress was friendly.
Food was great. We decided to go seasonal with the Oktoberfest menu. We had the Roasted Pork Confit Sandwich and The Bavarian Sausage Plate and we had a side of parmesan truffle fries.
The atmosphere was nice. The building itself was beautiful and is also a museum.
Drinks were good. We kept the oktoberfest theme and got a brooklyn kinda dry cidre and southern tier pumking
Price wasn't horrible for a NYC restaurant.  2 entrees 1 side and 3 beers for $86.
Would definitely go back to try some other seasonal foods there as well as the regular menu!

Visiting New York my mother in law recommended this place because it has good for and also a museum above it.

So first the museum was pretty big, it had wide variety stuff from flags to dinnerware and to get in its not super expensive.

The staff was pretty friendly and informative about everything. Pretty clean place too, I had no complaints. Now for the food, I was pleasantly surprised at how good the food was. This place has the best scotch egg that I've ever had.

Everyone else was really happy with their food as well.

Overall, it's a pretty cool place, located in the financial district,  all this history around you and inside the restaurant as well makes for an amazing atmosphere. Plus the food is really good. I would recommend this to any one who's going to New York for a vacation. Well worth stopping in for lunch or dinner.

Located not too far away from Battery Park, this historic pub offers a good selection of craft beers and food. Although they were out of many beers on the menu, the ones we did end up ordering were great. We also ordered a flatbread which was loaded with cheese and arugula and went really well with the wine. The server highly recommended the fish and chips - I didn't find the fish extraordinary but I still enjoyed it. The fries were pretty good though! The live music while dining outdoors, surrounded by the FiDi skyscrapers added to the tavern's appeal overall. Would recommend this place for a Friday or Saturday night dinner and drinks.

Came here for drinks and dinner and was blown away. The outdoor seating space on a weekend was great. Lots of seating available, very attentive service, and live music. The drink selection was excellent and price was pretty fair for this part of town. The highlight of the evening was the chicken pot pie, which came out steaming hot. It was a great sized portion, and tasted amazing. Unlike most pot pies, this wasn't too heavy and I didn't feel like taking a nap immediately afterwards. I highly recommend this place and that pot pie!

Pretty okay spot. I had their fish and fries and my husband had a burger at the restaurant. We sat outside, their staff was very friendly and wore masks at all time. The seating outside were socially distant as well.

A lot of history in this bar. Fraunces Tavern is one of the oldest in the United States. It's been the gathering place of many important figures through the years. Expensive for everything. The place seems to always be quiet at lunch.

Check out some of the history online before you come. It has a long history. There's many stories that can be told. It has been here since around the colonial days. They have been many famous people. George Washington liked coming here. The drinks nowadays have become super expensive, even for just a beer, including all the big brand ones. It's about $9 for a beer. The food is the same way. It's not much of a problem for me because there's not that much vegetarian friendly. This has a lot of common Irish pub stuff.

I would come again for the history. It has its own museum. That's better use of your money in my opinion.

Since its purchase and remodel in 2011, the new owners of Frances Tavern have done a good job of respecting this incredibly important and historic building.  With the addition of the museum and private dining rooms upstairs and the 'modern era' bar, there is the Tallmadge room. With its oak panelling, old world furnishings and high-18th century windows, this is one of the oldest rooms in the building and the heart of the Tavern.  This is where you can eat a meal where revolutionaries once dined, over two-hundred years ago.

Once we were seated, we noticed more locals/regulars dining here than tourists.  We saw several 'after work' dinners and gatherings going on, as well as some couples enjoying a slighty-romantic dinner.  The Tallmadge room caters to a variety of occasions. (It's always a good sign when the locals are regulars).

Proper dining at places like this (Historic tourist spots) can be difficult.
Some are in it to stick-it to the customer with pre-wrapped and frozen meals and steep prices.  The Tallmadge Room at the Tavern is a proper restaurant and does not fit into that category.   One of the highlights of the meal is  The Steak On A Stone - the signature dish here at the tavern. Complete with dirty rice with cherry tomatoes & pearled onions and three different dipping sauces- Dijon, chimichurri and soy. If you like your meat medium rare, pull your steak off the stone as soon as you get it, or it will cook very fast and go beyond your desired temperature.  A great dish,  nicely conceived and displayed.  Also great was the Berkshire Pork Chop, with Crispy onions, Parsnip Pur√©e and apple Bourbon Sauce.   They also had  a good selection of wine to choose from.  A fine meal all the way around.

Also good was the service.  The staff was attentive, efficient and always visible.  We were thoroughly satisfied. On our particular visit, the server taking care of us was from a foreign land and not American.  A graduate who was working here to help them get to the next stage of their pursuit.  We had a great time talking to them about where they came from and where they wanted to go.  It was nicely fitting to see the pursuit of the  American dream working so well at Francis Tavern.  I think George Washington today would enjoy the food and drink, as well as the staff and the service.
I'm in town 1-2 times a year and there are a couple of places I will always visit.  While most of my business is in mid-town, I think Francis Tavern has made the list of must-stops, when in NYC.  ""Four-Thumbs Up"" for me!

What a delightful establishment!  George Washington frequented this place and dismissed the Continental Army after the Revolutionary War from this building.

The food was delicious, but not hot enough.  I had the lamb stew.  It was overflowing with meat. The sauce was tasty but a bit thin.  The menu said it was served with bread but they were out of bread.  It sounds bad, but it was delicious.

While I ate, a local band played and it was perfect for the atmosphere.

Came here for happy hour- there were a lot of reserved seats so I'm not sure where people should sit if you didn't make a reservation. It is kind of dark in there as well but historic.

Drinks are the usual price- it was 15 bucks for an old fashioned. I didn't see any specials. The bar was full but not super packed. Older crowd. Right by the whitehall stations- R and W

Decent beer, but forced us to purchase an appetizer and made sure to state that fries din't count just to get us to pay $18 for an app (cheapest option was $15). Came for a couple drinks left with a hefty bill.

We love places with historical ties. Open since 1762, Fraunces Tavern served as a headquarters for George Washington during the American Revolution! The last time we came here was a couple years ago, but we wanted a place to grab a quick bite before jumping on the nearby Staten Island Ferry so coming here was a no brainer.

We arrived around 6 p.m. and noticed it was happy hour (4 p.m. to 7 p.m.) so we decided to try some things from that menu. We started with a couple refreshing and tasty Smuttynose IPAs and a dozen Happy Hour Oysters (priced at 6/$9). We also ordered their Roasted Garlic Hand Cut Fries from the regular menu.

Everything was fresh and delicious but I noted that there were only 11 oysters on our plate instead of the dozen that I ordered. After bringing out another oyster to us, we asked for the check because we were in a hurry and realized they charged us their regular prices instead of happy hour prices. They kindly changed the check to the correct amount.

When we have more time, I'd like to get back here and try their Tapas menu which looks to have many yummy offerings and reminds me of a recent trip to Spain. But when I do, I will take a second look at the bill before I leave.

Really cool historic restaurant, bar, museum, cocktail lounge.  All different areas for these 4 options.  Located in the downtown financial district near water street.  It was built in 1719, and became the most popular place in the area for drinks and food back in the day.  It is charming, exceptionally decorated (feels as historic as it is).  Great drink options, happy hour specials, oysters, full menu, full service restaurant, cute sitting area for quiet cocktails in between the bar and restaurant. I didn't visit the museum since I was there with colleagues and we had a tight schedule.  If you are history buff, this is a great place to check out.

This place was really fun. I went here for lunch during the week. The bar wasn't too busy, and it was super easy to find a seat. There is a sign that says ""2 drink minimum."" But I spoke to a few regulars, and they informed me that this wasn't enforced. Everyone sitting around me ordered a few drinks though.

I checked out their webpage before I walked here. It stated there was a ""seafood soup of the day."" I got excited about this and planned to order it. However, when I got here, the bartender informed me that the webpage was outdated and they didn't have a seafood soup.

I ordered the butternut squash soup, although it was pretty warm outside. It was tasty and I enjoyed it. I definitely would order this again and maybe try one of their entrees next time, as well.

I'll definitely be back here! It was sort of difficult to find the bar though. This restaurant has a lot of hallways and seems sort of like a maze. I needed the hostess to point me around the restaurant to show me the way.

This place is outstanding, great food, great ambiance, and lots of history. The building's foundation and frame makes it the oldest building in NYC. Yes, its been renovated numerous times but lots of it remains as it was several centuries ago. Without getting too much into its history, which includes a farewell dinner party for George Washington and his army, I will emphasize on the amazing food.

They serve British style pub food, as well as modern gastro pub fare. Lobster mac and cheese, Scottish eggs, fish and chips, raw oysters, are among the delicious old school Great Britain inspired pub cuisine. Everything on their menu is of high quality and freshness. This is not just a restaurant/museum that serves mediocre food. It's a place that takes its food seriously and provides consistent quality, as well as rare pre-colonial dishes that you can't just find anywhere anymore.

I came here to try the popular winter cocktail called the Spiked Hot Apple Cider. The cider is served hot and it is definitely spiked. The bartender immediately accommodated me and best time to go is on an early weekday after 5 but before 6pm. I was able to get a seat and got my cocktail almost immediately. The cocktail is made up of: George Dickel No.1 white corn whiskey with turmeric, ginger, maple syrup, orange juice and spices. Well, definitely I tasted all those ingredients. They also have a variety of draft beers from Porterhouse Brewing Company, which are very popular. Highly recommended cocktail plus you get access to see the museum and tavern where George Washington the 1st US president had his farewell party after leaving the presidency. However I would do research on the admission to the museum because they may have discounts on certain days, I know they have discounts for federal holidays.

I have had their food previously not this time around. Food was pricey. I had the chicken pot pie, which was George Washington's favorite dish. The quantity of food matched the price but the quality was not memorable.

Place is great for drinks especially if you like beers and ciders.

This tavern was an amazing place. It was full of history and had so much uniqueness about it. It has a huge whiskey list and the servers are able to tell you about the types in depth. They were extremely friendly and proud of their establishment. They even had live entertainment there. It look like they had a great menu. I ordered the lobster Mac off of it and was very impressed. I saw the burgers at the table next to us and they are going to be my next choice when I go back to New York and visit this place.

I love this restaurant ! The slow roasted chicken is outstanding, service is always friendly and fast. I have eaten here after finishing the Great Saunter which I've completed twice. With all the people coming into the restaurant I'm always amazed at how wonderful the staff handles everything. I know with Covid they are trying to operate outside. I hope this place makes it. Such history here and great food too!

Came in with a group of friends for a late dinner. Theres is great selection of drinks and food. It's a bit pricey and the food is mostly pub food, but it is done well.

The ambiance of the restaurant is great since it has that old American historical feel. It doubles as a museum, but appears very welcoming as a place to sit and drink.

Obviously the history is what makes the tavern a destination but the food is hardly an afterthought.

I seriously regret not taking a photo of my mom's filet mignon the other day -- it's one of the more generous sized portions of it that I've seen and served atop a hot lava stone that continues cooking the steak (brought out rare) to your liking. It's accompanied by three really, really good dipping sauces -- a mustard, balsamic-ish steak sauce, and chimichurri. Hard to pick a favorite.

My dad and I went with the lobster mac and cheese which was also exceptional and loaded with hunks of claw meat.

Ask to sit in the Porterhouse! It's the more funky and less stuffy side of the building. There's also an even more casual lil bar area towards the back that's great for just grabbing a beer.

Came here two summers ago, ordered the Fish and Chips, wow, a fresh and abundant portion. The ambiance and traditional food made the experience so worth the trip. The history of the building is evident, and the dark wood and industrial lighting make it a great place for lunch.

Landmark restaurant and bar in NYC. Established in 1762 with a museum upstairs.

Food and service are excellent. Dinner Portions are big and shareable. Prices are reasonable for downtown NYC.

We tried the bacon wrapped shrimp, grilled octopus to start and had diablo seafood, churrasco steak with chorizos, lamb shank (special) and Branzino.

I loved my pimm's summer cup and it was delightful mixed drink.
For whiskey lovers, there is a lovely whiskey bar seating area (not sure if reservations are required) with a lot of choices.
Wine and Beer enthusiasts can find ample choices as well.

I suggest you Go check it out for yourself.

Yes, perfect food and perfect service.

Normally, as a born and bred New Yorker, descended from the first founders of New Amsterdam, I avoid anyplace with tourists, but the Tavern is too good to miss out on.

The tourists are well mannered and very respectful of the environment, and the almost holiness of being able to eat and drink where Patriots said goodbye to General George Washington.

This is really, ""Old School""!

This place makes a truly delicious and expertly-cooked Impossible Burger (easily made vegan by omitting the cheese). Huge props for that! Other great things: 1) one of the best and most frequently-rotating beer selections in the whole city  & 2) live jazz!
I'm not usually interested in ""historic"" restaurants, but Fraunces Tavern really impresses me and is worth visiting. Despite its historic standing, it really doesn't feel too touristy at all - there's always a good mix of locals and visitors.
My only request: add even more vegan options! :)

It was 3pm on a Saturday and I was starving. I just so happened to search yelp for brunch locations close to where I was staying in NYC. This popped up and seemed like a warm, welcoming, historic spot to brunch. I'm so very glad I did! The atmosphere is friendly, the wait staff is AMAZING! I clumsily dropped my fork and knife on the floor and someone was there with new cutlery in less than a second. Water glasses were always filled without asking. Even better... they had a live jazz band playing. I fell in love! I'm so very happy I decided to pop in. Tips: ask for a table away from the door. The restaurant is cozy, but the doors open frequently and cold air blowing in gives you quite a chill.

It's a beautiful and historic spot with an amazing atmosphere and an evolving seasonal menu. But on a not that busy night, the service was somewhat clunky to non-existent.

I and 2 colleagues ordered the charcuterie board, letting the server decide what options we should get based on customer favorites. It was fine but pretty uninspired. Store bought quality at best.

As for my steak? In all of my years eating meat, I've never had my steak sliced before it arrived at the table. All of the juices poured out on to the plate, and frustratingly the steak was served fat side towards me so the first bite was a bit gnarly. I asked if I could swap out the potatoes for cauliflower or another veg also on the menu and was told no.

Food was fine, but without a doubt, this is not a destination.

We were very happy to find this place. It's beautiful inside, and on a late Saturday afternoon, the live jazz band inside was a treat. We rested our weary toes and started with a round of drinks. They seem to have a big team of servers assigned for different tasks.

I'm not much of a drinker, so I opted for a water. And for an early dinner, we decided to share several appetizers.  I loved my watermelon salad with feta and thick, generous slices of heirloom tomatoes. Whatever that citrus salad dressing was, it was divine.

We did have a problem with one order though. It was an appetizer that came in different flavors. My friends ordered one flavor, but when the dish arrived, it didn't look or taste like they expected. When questioning the server, she wordlessly picked up the dish and disappeared.  About 10 minutes later, she returned with the same dish, slammed it back down on the table (now it was cold) and said, ""The kitchen says the order is correct."" And just walked off.

So now we were left with a cold dish. She didn't ask if we wanted to order something different if we weren't happy with it. She didn't offer to replace it with a fresh hot order. In fact, we couldn't find her again until we had to chase someone down to ask for the check.

So in case anyone was wondering, that's how you don't get a tip in a restaurant.

This place has it all-- especially if you love history!  Located in the Wall Street District, you will find many fine things in the area.  This Tavern is one of the best in the area.  Great food, live music, wonderful happy hour specials and a superb wait staff make it something very special.

A little pricey menu but it is NYC and the food was well worth it.  Between the three of us we had the chicken pot pie, fish and chips, and eggs Benedict.  All was excellent.  The service was even better.  The waiter made great recommendations and made us feel quite at home.

Take a few minutes to look around while you are waiting in your food.  The ambience is wonderful.  Visit the museum upstairs before/after.  It is well worth the $7 admission.  Also, take a stroll around the neighborhood.  There is so much to see regarding the original New York and lots of interesting old buildings to look at.   Look ahead at the website to find when live music and happy hour specials are happening.  However, a weekend brunch is also perfect.

Actually, very surprised this place is not more of a tourist attraction on travel sites.  I am so glad I visited!!

Came here for a happy hour. Pretty cool place. It is steeped in history, but we all know we're here for the food so let me get into it.

$1 meatballs - only comes in orders of 6. Amazing and delicious. Would highly recommend.
$1 oysters - did not get because not a huge fan of oysters, but good to know for the oyster lovers out there. Also only comes in orders of 6.
$6 beers - There are only 2 beers that are $6. The rest are regular price so beware of that. It's not the best deal.

Also tried to chicken pot pie which was extremely good. The cream was a little reminiscent of New England Clam Chowder because of how rich and delicious it was.

The short rib sliders were also extremely delicious. They have these caramelized onions that are perfectly sweet and compliment the short ribs perfectly.

We also had a scotch egg, which was amazing, but it was also $15 for a single egg. I don't know if I would ever pay that much again. In general the food here is extremely expensive. Even the meatballs were a bit on the small side. The music here is not memorable but the vibes are good and service is decent. I would come come back here for a special occasion but this isn't a place i would frequent on the regular. I'm not made of money bro.

It's hard to say something original in a yelp post about a place this historic and with this many reviews. I greatly enjoy the atmosphere, but find their system of only serving some of the beers they have depending on when other beers run out archaic and confusing.

Great spot! This was fun for a Friday night. Good food with an extensive drink menu too. There's something here to please everyone. It has a very cozy feel to it. We enjoyed the chicken liver pate, the bacon Mac and cheese and the Parmesan truffle fries. The Max and cheese reheats well too.

Generally speaking, I like historic places and Fraunces Tavern is THE oldest building in New York City.  The building actually dates back to the Revolutionary War and if you have enough time to take a tour of the place, please do so.  One thing that should be addressed before you go is to make sure that you get accurate directions before you go.  I actually asked several people AND had my GPS and passed by the place quite a few times before I actually arrived at my destination.  The ""Pearl"" street sign is basically nonexistent.

Since I arrived at the restaurant prior to the rest of my dining party and I was starving, I decided to order their meatballs and a drink while I waited.  I must admit that the service at Fraunces Tavern is wonderful and I couldn't have been treated better as person sitting by myself and waiting for others. (It's been my personal experience, that when I have been alone, I have been completely ignored until someone else showed up.  Like as a single woman, I didn't exist until more people arrived.)  So kudos on the service, however, the meatballs were lacking.  The actual taste of the sauce was good, but the meatballs themselves weren't tender.  I don't think that there was enough binder added to them and that made them tough.

Once the rest of the party showed up, we proceeded to order the ""Traditional Fish and Chips (Beer battered cod and mushy peas), Slow Roasted Chicken Pot Pie, The Churrasco platter with Skirt Steak, spicy Chorizo sausage and roasted plantains and the Organic Salmon Pappardelle. (I wanted to order the Berkshire Pork Porterhouse Chop with Fuji apples and celeriac puree, but they were out of that and the Branzino.  Sigh! )  We also ordered the Hand-cut Fries with Truffle & Parmesan.  The Chicken Pot Pie was scrumptious and what you want in that type of dish... A warm, flavorful hug!  My daughter and sister enjoyed the Fish and Chips and my friend DD enjoyed the Salmon Pappardelle.  I don't know if I was jaded after eating from everyone's plate, but I just found my Churrasco platter to be okay.  Nothing bad, but nothing spectacular either.  I also think that I was really disappointed that I couldn't order the Berkshire Porterhouse chop. (I actually looked at the menu ahead of time and I had my heart set on devouring that.)

So, the question is, would I return to this restaurant?  The answer is honestly that NYC has so many amazing restaurants, that I had my moment here already.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone that loves/likes historical buildings and restaurants.  However, there's nothing really drawing me back again personally and I can try other restaurants that I've been trying to get to.

We decided to be tourists for the day and found ourselves at Fraunces Tavern in the rain. There are tons of different rooms, and I wonder how the experiences might differ. We were at the bar in the central room, and it was relatively quiet at 4:00 on a Tuesday. Bartender was efficient and made a recommendation for whiskey. I didn't love her recommendation, but also didn't tell her that, so that's on me. Large tap list, but it just depends where they are in the list in terms of what you get. Overall, another touristy spot downtown, although it felt nice to get it with a bit of history. A fine place if you need somewhere to stop in, but I probably wouldn't make it my destination.

We literally stumbled upon this unbelievably cool spot. Such a fun place to have a beer and just admire the history of this watering hole.
We stopped in before happy hour and the place was a little busy. It's dark and warm inside. We sat at the bar and were in amazed by their beer list. 140 beers either on draft, can or bottle. If you're whiskey fanatic, they carry some impressive brands.
Our bartender was so spot on with his recommendations (beer and whiskey).
We ordered their whole chicken wings which were large and delicious! Each piece had a wing and drumstick...
Their prices are very reasonable for the area.
Take a walk around and admire the history. From my understanding there is even a small museum.
Definitely a stop in for a friendly chat and a craft beer. ENJOY!

Don't have anything bad to say about this place. We came here for happy hour and had a very happy time!

Love that the building has so much history to it and the interior was very cool and cozy. Service was very slow at first with the english accent waiter but he left and it was a lady that was tending to us and she was very fast and efficient.

Don't believe the happy hour menu had any food but the drinks were very strong. All the food we ordered were very yummy as well (besides the wings), slightly on the pricier side.

Overall a great place to come and experience for yourself

Our friends from CT told us about this historic bar down by Wall Street and since we were doing the One World Center we decided to hoof it on over and try it.

This place is rustic, has old world charm and is clean.  There are many rooms to this place plus a couple of sitting bars.
There was a jazz band playing music on Saturday afternoon, it added to the atmosphere.

Service was really good, the food wasn't bad but wasn't anything to write home about.  The Oyster Stout draft was excellent.

It's a must try if you are in the area.

Unfortunately we didn't get to try the food. We came in for libations and to rest our tired feet.

The server was very accommodating and help us with our adult beverage selections.

So much history in one place was great to see.

I came here while there was outdoor seating, and the restaurant basically wrapped around 2 blocks of streets. I'm glad that they were able to maintain a large capacity during the pandemic.

The pull-apart bread is one of the best breads out there. It's a MUST-TRY since it's fluffy and delicious. I would come back to the restaurant just for the bread. Everything else we ordered was tasty as well.

One of my main concerns is the lack of vegetarian entrees. When I went, there was one pasta on the menu that was vegetarian, but checking online now, the menu changed and it doesn't look like it's available anymore.

I'll be back when they have a new vegetarian option and to try the dessert, which isn't included in the prix fixe (but was still too much food for us to order the dessert separately last time). Would definitely recommend you try this place out, even if just for the bread.

I'm so glad that Crown Shy can operate during the continuation of the Covid pandemic. The Eleven Madison Park pedigree shines through with tasteful food at much lower prices. Presentation was great, visually the food was as good as my taste buds experience.

Cocktails were fine, my wife had one of the mezcal based one, I only had a glass of red - Cabernet By the glass was killer.

Overall, very well executed, and I went in August before indoor dining was aloud. There outdoor space is great on the weekends as the little road is closed.

This was an amazing outdoor experience during covid and some of the best food I've had. You do have to make reservations but there is no time limit for your table. The menu is a three course tasting which a few choices, and their delicious bread comes free. The short rib special which was melt in your mouth good. For cocktails, the flightplan and radicle were delicious as well as a 2013 port with dessert. Sticky toffee pudding was so good. They did forget our dessert and one cocktail until they were reminded but gave me an extra pour to compensate. Well worth it!

I have to say, Crown Shy blew me away.

I made reservations when NY was just allowing indoor reservations and was a little nervous about how it would work. The tables were far apart enough to be distanced but not too much where it feels awkward. They are only serving the prix fixe menu which I have no complaints about. The service was great, I never looked around for someone to help or for anything. Bonus points for a completely touchless payment and spray hand sanitizer for the table.

We started with the pull apart bread. Delicate and exciting enough to make you anxious for the next dish. Next came the white bean hummus. We had fun with the creative vehicles that were provided for our hummus. Overall the hummus was really flavourful and light at the same time. For our appetizers, I got the romaine salad and my boyfriend got the honeynut squash. He was really impressed by the dish and every bite it provided.

For our entrees, we got the chicken liver cavatelli and the steak (which is not listed on the menu). We had to pay extra for the steak but trust me when I say, it's.worth.every.penny. The steak was so perfectly cooked that it was hard to process really. The cavatelli was good but the liver was a bit tough. You must get the steak!

There is something about a simple menu that provides an almost unexpected amount of satisfaction. I highly recommend!

So let me start with saying - this was my first ever Michelin star restaurant, hence my expectations were a bit more elevated than usually.

Crown Shy suggests Prix-Fix menu only, for dinner, which is $72 per person and includes bread and hummus to share for the table, plus a choice of appetizer and entree - which is a pretty good deal for a Michelin star restaurant

The bread was delicious and so was the hummus (possibly the best I've ever tried!), for hummus they also brought some veggies to dip, I wish there was a bit more of them though, as we ran out quickly

For starters we chose Pear Salad and char crudo - they were good and quite unusual dishes, but nothing to write home about.

For entrees I went with branzino and my BF opted for short rib ($50 surcharge) which was amazing and he said it was the best short rib he's ever tasted! Was worth the extra money, and the portion was generous.

As it was our anniversary we got presented with two tiny cute cupcakes - thank you, Crown Shy!

The service was impeccable too.

The reason I took one star out is limited (imho) selection of sparking wines by the glass and the fact that my BF did not like his cocktail much (Cognac Crown).

Also, some reviewers mentioned that they left the restaurant hungry - definitely was NOT the case for us - we were literally rolling out from it

All in all, good restaurant that I would recommend visiting, but I don't see myself returning any time soon.

The bread and the warm hummus they give is 10/10

Appetizers were good but nothing I would come back for again (ordered the sweet potato and the crudo).

Main dishes were good but the overcharge is a bit overpriced. At $72 for the prix fixe menu the entree is roughly valued at $40 which is more than what I would pay for the chicken. We also ordered the short rib for an up charge of $50 which meant the total entree value was around $90 which I found steep. Yes the food is good but for the value I found this meal to be expensive.

The cocktail I ordered was about average and priced at $19.

We got the sorbet with marshmallow and the dessert was not good at all...the cookie tasted burnt and the sorbet was ok, but a bit too tart. The marshmallow was good and the only portion I enjoyed.

The service was good but the upcharge explanation was confusing.

My boyfriend and I returned to celebrate my birthday and I finally got to try the satsuma orange dessert. Yas. They're only offering a 3-Course Price Fixe at the moment, but don't worry, they're still serving all the classics. I tried:

+ Radicle cocktail - still amazing
+ Flightplan cocktail - loved this
+ RIP Aerlume cocktail - my BF enjoyed it
+ Hummus, 'Nduja, Crudit√©s - great
+ Tomato, Peach, Meredith Feta - basically summer on a plate
+ Eggplant, Tahini, Yogurt - I LOVE TINY EGGPLANTS
+ Branzino, Cucumber, Avocado - great
+ Spaghetti, Sungold, Basil - great
+ Satsuma Orange, Honey, Toasted Marshmallow - one of the best desserts at Crown Shy and anywhere, really

5 thousand stars forever.

Returned for brunch and it was just as amazing. Easily got a reservation (but I imagine everyone will catch on soon). Don't miss the pastries to start - the Cinnamon bun with cream cheese was absolutely incredible. Also liked the Banana bread with creme fraiche and Maple doughnut with smoked pecan.

For the entrees, Biscuit with sausage gravy and soft scrambled eggs was excellent, and the Smoked salmon with potato Rosti was out of this world. 5 thousand stars forever.

Next time: I want to return for dinner soon, because there are a bunch more things I need to try (red snapper crudo, the creamsicle dessert).

Crown Shy has obviously been receiving reviews and hype up the wazoo, and while I usually give places much longer to get it together before trying them, in this case I was very much swayed by the photos of food. So my boyfriend and I did a weekday walk-in at around 6:20, and were seated at the bar about 10 minutes later.

I started with the Radicle cocktail, which was great. The complimentary pull apart bread was heavenly. Seriously, how is that stuff free? We then had the gruyere fritters, which were a little bit of a letdown - the pastry on the outside was only ok, not as delicious as it looked in the pics. Filling was amazing, though. Romaine was also great and stacked in such a way that defied physics.

For entrees, we just did pastas - the Caramelle was maybe my favorite thing that we ate, and the Cavatelli was awesome, too. Plus, we had the charred carrots. Carrots with clams was a first for me, but it really worked. Finally, sticky toffee pudding for dessert was excellent.

4.5 stars. I'd try the roasted short rib next time!

Amazing outdoor dinner on a Saturday night. Food, service, atmosphere. Everything is impeccable.  I got hummus, charred eggplant and branzino, while my husband got fritter, lettuce and chicken.

My favorite dish is branzino -  the skin is very crispy yet the meat remains tender. The sauce is the highlight: a bit spicy, umami, but not too overpowering. My husband's favorite is the gruyere fritters. They look like churros but tastes nothing like churros!

The vodka cocktails are also very delicious - strong enough, refreshing, yet not too sweet.

They also have limited short rib available for dinner. Next time I will definitely try that

This ambitious restaurant with a curious name is one of the few reasons I'd ever find myself in the FiDi neighborhood. I have yet to indulge myself in a meal at Eleven Madison Park, but dining at this first project from their former chef is as close as I'll get for now. Their outdoor setup on the sidewalk of a narrow, dimly lit street with lots of cars driving through is less than ideal, but it's great that this is even an option during this time when indoor dining is prohibited in NYC. I stole a longing glance at the dining room when I went inside the building to wash my hands, and marveled at the elegant light fixtures and the cool open kitchen format, thinking of the day I'd get to enjoy a meal inside. Until then, I appreciate that they're doing the best they can with the outdoor tables, which are carefully spaced out and they're playing great music to keep the ambience poppin' too.

Their menu is pared down to a 3 course prix fixe, with just a couple of options in each, so I'd study the menu beforehand to make sure everyone in your party will find something to suit their palate and dietary restrictions. For snacks, my dining companion and I enjoyed both the gruyere fritters and hummus with crudites. I felt that there weren't enough vegetables to eat with the very good hummus, but that's where the complimentary bread came in to fill the void. I now understand why people unanimously sing the praises of this complimentary bread, which is honestly one of the highlights of the meal, with its buttery, pull apart texture, tasty flecks of tapenade on top, and a rich, side of creme fraiche to enjoy it all with. The gruyere fritters are like a savory churro, filled with melty cheese and sprinkled with a chili lime seasoning that is so good, you'll stop balking at the $14 supplemental fee they charge you for ordering it.

The appetizer portion was possibly the best part of our meal, as the kitchen really let the seasonal vegetables in the dishes shine. The peach and tomato salad had several different types of tomatoes in it, each with its own flavor profile, ranging from juicy cherry tomatoes to sweet and fruity sungold tomatoes. The addition of mint, feta, and a tasty basil sauce created a bright, summery salad and really signaled to us that we were at a fine dining establishment that lived up to its reputation. They also understand the magical thing that happens to eggplant when it's charred, transforming the texture and flavor which gives it a deep, caramelized richness that would convert any eggplant naysayer into an eggplant superfan.

Entrees were similarly impressive despite their relative simplicity. Tender was a word we used to describe each of our dishes, which were the citrus-marinated chicken and the branzino with squash mole respectively, and though the portions seemed small, we were plenty full by the time dessert rolled around. My sweet tooth could not say no to the satsuma orange, honey ice cream with toasted marshmallow. I have no idea what a satsuma orange is but the flavor presented like a creamy sorbet, with crunchy pieces of honeycomb and was topped with a torched marshmallow that had the airy, whipped consistency of a dense whipped cream. We also had the Radicle and Flightplan cocktails, which appear to be a popular order and were expertly made, surprising no one.

Service was easy going and attentive. The only hiccup that occured during our meal is that the salad came out with almonds, which we explicitly stated would send my partner into anaphylactic shock if consumed. Definitely not ideal when our allergies were noted by the server and that we were assured our meal would be nut & almond free, but fortunately the almonds were really visible in the dish so we did not dig into what could've been a death trap.

Narrowly escaping a bad end to the night aside, our meal was a memorable one. Definitely beats any meal I can slap together at home.

The food here is delicious. We had dinner here for our anniversary. Everything from the bread we had before the meal to the chocolate dessert was delicious. There was a bit of a delay getting our main course but the waitress was very nice about it and they gave us a complimentary dessert because of it. I loved the olive oil bread, the hummus, and the pear salad, and the branzino. The chocolate dessert with stracciatella ice cream was great.

Honestly the worst experience at a Michelin restaurant at NYC. Both the salad and the bread came with a bug, which was disgusting and made us lose appetite. Such experience never happened at any other Michelin restaurants that I have gone before.
The short rib is good. We ordered three desserts and the pudding is the best.
The service here is just ok. Could get better service and food with the same price at other restaurant.

I've been wanting to come here for a while. My partner and I arrived on a Saturday night, we were 20 mins late than our reservation time. Luckily, we still got seated right away. The restaurant is packed, so don't forget to make a reservation in advance.

I love the decor in Crown Shy, it's very minimalist and classy. There's a bar area, an open kitchen and a bigger dining area. They play hip pop music in the background. It has a pretty casual vibe. I think it's great spot for a girls/bro night or a date night.

Now let's talk about food, the complementary bread is real good. Can't stop eating it. We ordered the romaine salad which is one of the highly recommended dish. I will not order it again, because I don't wanna pay $17 for three pieces of romaine anymore. It doesn't taste bad or anything, it's very fresh, but it's not satisfying at all. We got the Gruyere Fritter, I enjoyed it, it's kinda sour and spicy. We both liked the short ribs a lot, you should definitely give it a try. For dessert, we got the cream puffs, it's delicious.

I ordered No Mas (non- alcoholic) for drink, if you like citrusy drinks, you will enjoy this.

We will definitely go back and try more dishes.

We had a 3 course meal for lunch here on a Monday, and this place served the best chicken I have had in my life!

When I first arrived, I was waiting for the rest of the party, so they seated me at the bar, where I got to chat with the friendly bartenders about absinthe. Turns out they offered Pernod Absinthe Superieure under spirits on the alcohol menu, which I was quite giddy about, so when we all ordered alcohol, that was the drink I ordered.

We chose to dine from the 3-course Pix Fixe, and this was what I ordered:

Appetizer: Fluke Crudo, Citrus, Sesame Tuile
Wonderful appetizer. I love fish, and it was quite refreshing, kind of like sashimi covered in a thin crust of sesame.

Entree: Grilled Citrus-Marinated Chicken, Hot Sauce
An additional $10, but it was so worth it. I swear, this was the best chicken I have ever had in my life! It was a hit with my entire party. It was perfectly grilled, juicy, with the best flavors that are spiced just right and the right texture for the chicken! Meat was tender and plump, and the skin perfectly crisp without feeling oily and fatty. BEST CHICKEN EVER.

Dessert: Apple sorbet, Sticky Toffee Pudding, Pecans
It was delicious! It was a small, decadent treat that was like a fancy version of apple pie.
The party ordered one of each dessert on the menu, so I also sampled the Satsuma Orange Ice Cream with Honey and Toasted Marshmallow, and the Roasted Banana Ice Cream, Caramel, Peanut Butter. They were all wonderful!

We really enjoyed our lunch here on a Monday afternoon. Fantastic first meal outing for this New York trip!

Enjoying brunch in the Financial district named Crown Shy. It's a super modern look inside with a very beautiful bar layout.

I came here with three girlfriends and shared all the plates to try different items. We ordered the lox plate which had some tasty crisp potatoes. I also ordered the chicken sausage and a side of potatoes that were different types of potatoes. These were small and pretty filling. For dessert, we choose to order the sample of bread and you get to pick three varieties of it. Overall each bread was nice and tasty but my favorite has to be the banana bread.

It was a pretty fun brunch and pretty tasty. Everything was delicious and even though it was super busy the service was good. I would want to come back and try more things on their brunch menu. But also I would want to come back and try dinner options!

My only regret about my meal at Crown Shy is that we didn't order more food. I was able to get a prime time reservation here during Christmas week, and was so glad I did - one of the best dining experiences I had during the year. Crown Shy is classy and slightly fancy (the bathrooms have Le Labo products), but not pretentious. You won't look out of place in jeans and sneakers here, provided they are cute. I agree with other reviewers that the service is at a slower pace than the pedigree of this restaurant might suggest, but I didn't mind that.

We got the gruyere fritters, the hummus, carrots in clam broth, and of course the free pull apart olive bread. The bread is truly one of the best things about this restaurant, especially considering that other restaurants are charging $6 for some torn up multigrain and a chunk of salted butter. Everything that Crown Shy does goes above and beyond the norm, and that goes for the free bread as well.

The menu here is not overly descriptive (i.e., you're not really sure what the thing you ordered is going to look/taste like), which can go terribly wrong at some places, but is always a very pleasant surprise at Crown Shy. Really delicious and creative small plates, where the pairing of ingredients and textures genuinely works and isn't just thrown together for shock value. For dessert we had the roasted banana ice cream, which unsurprisingly was amazing. Can't wait to come back and try the other two thirds of the menu.

I had been excited to try Crown Shy after having read numerous glowing reviews of this new restaurant. Unfortunately, I was surprised that the experience did not reflect what I had heard and read. The restaurant itself is beautiful with high ceilings, a nice bar at front, and a minimal, but comfortable feel. The wait staff is absolutely lovely, kind, and attentive.

The real disappointment was the food. We ordered the charred carrots with razor clams and thyme (at the recommendation of the waiter) and the charred octopus with red rice and sausage. The carrots were pretty tasteless as well as the accompanying clams. The charred octopus was over-cooked and difficult to eat as well as lacking flavor. We had planned to order dessert, but were so underwhelmed by our meal, decided to forgo it. While Crown Shy is a lovely dining experience, the surprisingly poor quality and taste of the food would not make me want to return.

While the service and drinks at Crown Shy were excellent, the vegetarian food was...not bad but also not quite as good as I expected it to be.

I started my evening with a mocktail - a No Mas. It tasted good: Citrucy and tart, but I didn't quite taste the rose that they described as being in the drink.

As expected of a restaurant with a Michelin star, the place setting, as well as its individual components were impeccable. I particularly loved the glassware they use.

The service was also mostly impeccable. I particularly appreciated that from the moment my server approached the table, she knew and understood my dietary restrictions that I had listed on my reservation. (I went as a party of one). I felt well taken-care of. The only thing that I noticed was that when I ordered my appetizer and entree, I felt like the server tried two or three times to suggest that I get a salad as well, even though I mentioned that I was only ""medium hungry."" That said, I understand that this is a common practice among restaurants. The service was otherwise impeccable.

I really enjoyed the olive pull-apart bread they served at the beginning. It was soft, fluffy, and perfectly seasoned, with bits of olive paste between some of the layers. The outside of the bread was a bit oily (in a good way, not overly so), so I appreciated that they served it with a smooth, creamy labne instead of butter (which would have been too much grease). I could eat this bread all day.

As my appetizer, I ordered the gruyere fritters. It was a large portion that seemed to be designed for a party of two or three. The presentation was ok, but the fritters themselves were underwhelming. It was mostly a doughy mini-churro with a bit of gruyere sauce inside, which squirted out when you tried to cut it with a fork and knife. It tasted average, like something I could get at a concession stand or a food truck.

Perhaps the server noticed my reaction to the gruyere fritters, because the bar sent over a complimentary drink. It was a mango soda with mint and togarashi (Japanese spice). It was sweet with a bit of a kick and I really liked it (more than the No Mas).

My main course was the Lasagnetti with smoked mozzarella. The pasta itself felt a bit dry. The bechamel sauce it was on top of had an uneven consistency. The endive salad on top was good, but the chestnut garnish was too hard to chew. All together, the smoky flavor was too strong and felt like it overpowered whatever other flavors I was supposed to taste. Moreover, the texture was odd - too chewy because of the dry pasta, and the dry hardness (not a crunch) of the chestnuts was incompatible with the rest of the dish.

At the very end, I ordered the Sauternes dessert wine. Hats off to the sommelier because it was excellent - sweet and floral with a delicate flavor profile.

For my birthday, they brought out a cupcake with a candle for me (but thankfully didn't sing happy birthday, which I appreciated). The cupcake was delicious and may have even been my favorite part of the meal. The chocolate cake base was perfectly moist and just the right level of sweetness. You could taste the high quality of the chocolate it was made with. I'm not typically a fan of icing on cake, but the icing on the cupcake was delightfully surprising. It was a mix of two separate flavors swirled together. Each of the flavors harmonized perfectly with the other. The first flavor was chocolate and the other was some kind of custardy/fruity (but not too fruity) flavor. I really enjoyed the cupcake.

My bill arrived in a timely manner but I was encouraged to take my time to finish my wine and cupcake.

I also appreciated how I was able to pack the food I wasn't able to finish, and it was waiting for me at coat check at the end of my meal.

Overall, the meal was not bad, but the quality seemed to vary greatly between the dishes.

I mean this place nails it. Finally a restaurant in FiDi worthy of a Michelin, at reasonable prices, in a setting that is family-friendly, world class, chic, all in one. The restaurant is located in a condo? building, but there are signs on the outside describing how to get in. Once there you are greeted by friendly staff on the outside, who help you navigate your way.

Some hits: cocktails, the donuts and pastries at brunch, the octopus at dinner.

Also, this place has some amazing restrooms...

This place is the restaurant child from the former chef of NoMad and the former manager of Del Posto, both one star Michelin spots in their own right, so it's no surprise that a a Michelin Star would grace this establishment.

Loves:
+ Food is good. For two people we split: gruyere fritters, white bean hummus + bread, chicken, a pasta dish, and the setsuma orange ice cream. It was enough!
+ Fritters are a must but I was pleasantly surprised with how impressive the chicken tasted. So juicy and yum... it honestly puts so much of the chicken I've had in my life to shame.
+ Very friendly staff.
+ Nice cocktails.
+ Received a delicious chocolate cupcake since it was my birthday.
+ Classy and clean space.

If I have to nitpick at things I can't say I love this being in a business building, but helloOOoo! we are in FiDi. Also this is not a budget meal but it is Michelin rated so there you go.

Overall yes, I'd gladly come back. :)

I was very excited to land a reservation at Crown Shy, but was extremely disappointed. Especially for a Michelin Star restaurant.

The only option is a 3-course price fix menu for $68 per person. Not too bad for NYC, but the portions were EXTREMELY small. The ""snack"" and ""appetizer"" were very tiny, but I guess that's to be expected. However, I ordered the chicken for my entree, and was disappointed to be served half of a small chicken breast (photo attached).

The most disappointing part about the entire dining experience was the service. I understand times are tough for restaurants during COVID, but service is the one thing that's in your control. Our service was extremely slow. We sat down at 8:30pm, and didn't leave until 11:00pm. Keep in mind, this was only a 3 course dinner with extremely small portions. We could have easily been finished in an hour if we were actually being attended to.

The only enjoyable part of dinner was the cocktails. The Watermelon Negroni was amazing!

Overall, the service was slow, drinks were great, and the food was just okay...but not Michelin Star quality, and definitely not worth the price.

From the time I got seated to the time I finished my dinner, I had a wonderful experience eating here.

They have enough staff to take care if you quickly.  And the food was phenomenal!

They started off giving me a delicately soft small loaf with spices inside served with labne.

I started with oysters with cucumber gelee.  That is cucumber in jello cut thinly in little bits on top of fresh oysters on rice with a small miso leaf for decor and flavor.

Second, I ordered the Romaine salad leaves brushed with homemade green goddess dressing with toasted bread crumbs between the layered leaves.

Third, I tried the Caramel Morel Ch√®vre.  I could smell the aroma of the motel when they served it.  The pasta was shaped like candy stuffed with ch√®vre inside and served with buttery tasting sauce that tasted very French.  One of my favorites

I had to try the chicken they brined for 36 hours they demonstrated on TV.  It was spicy with slices of Jalape√±os and spicy sauce on the side.

The dessert was the best part!  I had both the sticky toffee pudding and satsuma orange ice cream.  Both were exact.  The Satsuma orange ice cream reminds me of Baked Alaska with crispy honey comb toffee.  The toffee pudding had caramel sauce and plenty of toasted pecans served with green apple sorbet or was it ice cream?   And delicious cream that is not sweet.

Another day:
Yesterday,  we went here to have Sunday brunch.  The menu is different on Sunday brunch.

I had to try their  bacon and nut donuts which I highly recommend.  It is a yeast donut with homemade
Chantilly type cream in the center.

I had their home made bread French toast with chantilly cream as well.  Their coffee is unlimited if black (maybe if you had with milk too).

My friends had the steak breakfast with a salad and couscous.  That looked delicious as well.  But the shrimp salad looks too simple.  They also only served halves of shrimp. It is a restaurant I could go to a lot of times.  Excellent and cannot go wrong with any order  n you make.

So, this was one of my favorite new restaurants.  I've left a review before but this is a during Covid - post lockdown review.  The protocols in place are AMAZING.  They have an outdoors now.  The tables inside are super spread apart.  They do temp checks and collect contact information for tracing.  You scan the QR code for the menu.  They ask that everyone wear a mask when a server is coming to the table or you are getting up.  They had silverware packed separately in packs - so no one had to touch anything AND hand sanitizer at every table!   So BRAVO for all of that.
Omar was our server and we ADORED him! It is a
Pre-fix menu which we don't love - but we LOVE Crown Shy and it was my bday - so I wanted to go
to one of my favorite spots.  Really, if the food is so incredible, does is matter that it is price fixed? Hell no!
Cocktails are INCREDIBLE! Food is MELT IN YOUR MOUTH.  Between the 4 of us we ordered every item on the menu and shared.
So impressed with precautions they have taken.

Extremely yummy brunch at Crown Shy! I went with a party of 4 at 1 pm with a reservation. Once our whole party arrived, we were seated immediately. The restaurant has a beautiful ambience - it is spacious and full of light. Service was good - our waitress was attentive and especially accommodating towards dietary restrictions.

The food was great - I got the short rib sandwich. The sandwich was great and had lots of layers of flavor with the tomato compote. The side potatoes were very yummy and had a nice crunch to them.

Overall, great meal and experience. Will definitely be back for dinner!

We had another amazing dinner here. This time (again with a group of four), we got (in rough order of preference):

Grilled chicken
Gruyere fritters
Cappellacci with sweet potato
----
White bean hummus
Fluke crudo
Charred octopus
----
Short rib
Lasagnette
Grilled pear salad
Charred carrots

The chicken was the biggest surprise, since grilled chicken (or really any kind of non-fried chicken) is usually so boring. This one was incredible though, and I'd have a hard time coming here and not getting it again.

One thing I thought last time and definitely feel after this last visit is that the short rib is overkill. It's great (everything here is great, even the dishes on the third tier above), but it's by far the most expensive dish on the menu, and you could get so much bang for your buck by replacing that with 2-3 other dishes.

Even after all of the above, we still managed to finish with three desserts: the chocolate tart, the satsuma orange ice cream, and the roasted banana ice cream. I'd probably skip the banana next time, but the other two were really great.

This was outstanding. We went with a group of four and got the following (in rough order of my preference):

- Gruyere fritters
- Octopus
----
- Short rib
- Hummus
- Cavatelli
----
- Caramelle
- Chicories salad

The only two that I'd say aren't must-reorders or close to it are the bottom two -- all the rest were really amazing, as was the complementary pull-apart olive bread that you start with. (Starting with that, followed by the gruyere fritters and then the incredible bread you get with the hummus, we were basically in carb heaven before we even saw any of the pastas.)

The prices are also surprisingly reasonable for this kind of place, and the price/volume ratio was really solid for everything but the short rib, which made up for the lack of volume by being incredible. I will say, though, I could easily see coming here and replacing that with two or three other dishes, since there's so much on the menu to try.

We finished with the chocolate tart and two ice creams: milk chocolate and roasted banana. I'm not huge on banana ice cream, but the other two were amazing, especially the crumble on top of the chocolate ice cream.

Overall, feels like this will almost certainly be on the best-new-restaurants-in-NYC-2019 lists, and we will certainly be back.

What a huge letdown. I didn't even have high hopes for it to begin with because the only reason my husband and I ate there was because it's in the same building as our hotel. We also didn't realize it was a prix-fix menu only until after we were seated.
We begrudgingly went for it both having the bread, hummus, pear salad and chicken. Cocktail wise we both ordered the coconut something?
I'll admit, the bread was fantastic. The chicken wasn't noteworthy, was a teeny tiny portion (literally HALF a chicken breast!!!), and honestly dry. Everything else was just not up to par for the hefty price tag. Both our salads and dishes of hummus were left nearly untouched by both my husband and I for not liking the flavor. Our cocktails were refreshing, but no more so than a coconut flavored seltzer water is considered. At $19 I'd expect more than an extremely weak drink that was mostly ice.
Service was also **seriously** lacking for a star rated restaurant. Our dishes were left on our table without being cleared despite it becoming clearly overcrowded with ones we were finished with and our water was also not refilled. There seemed to be plenty of staff present yet alas they didn't seem to care and were difficult to actually wave down dispite the place being surprisingly dead.
Immediately after leaving my husband and I went across the street to the poke place because we were still starving. The simple fact of even needing a second dinner IMMEDIATELY after dropping a couple hundred is insane.
Never again.
I am dumbfounded how this place has such amazing reviews. This was also not my first visit to a Michelin Star rated restaurant. I've been to plenty and know the deal. This place is simply just so undeserving given our entire experience.

Wonderful service. Great dirty martini. But in a coupe as opposed to martini glass. White bean hummus was great. Short ribs was pretty good. Not sure it was worth the upcharge. Bronzino was okay. Could do w more taste. Pricey. $320 for two.

Ambience: 4.5/5
Service: 5/5
Food: 4/5

Cautious to give a 5... I truly LOVED 2-3 dishes, and found 2 to be just ok. Classic date night material, elevated with some very interesting dishes. I couldn't say exactly what kind of cuisine Crown Shy might be, but take a look at the menu and you'll see you get a bit from all over.

Walk through a very grand entrance into a more casually sophisticated candlelit dining room. The food matches the setting: kinda classic, kinda modern, kinda cool.

White bean hummus with (very good) puffed bread (4.5/5) was a beautiful little series of plates, perhaps just a bit too little, but all very tasty. The puffed bread is super thin and delightful - saves you stomach room for later.

Charred carrots with razor clams (5/5) is a MUST order! The foam of cauliflower/parsnips is really luxurious, hiding little juicy razor clams, and I could drink a bowl of that.

Octopus (4/5) was good but not amazing, mostly because it was too salty and some of the bean mixture was unpleasantly al dente.

The Chicken (4/5) has been a star in a lot of reviews, but I thought it was okay. Tasty but relies a lot on the hot sauce and fresh vegetables on top. I was slightly jealous of our neighbors eating the short ribs.

Please, PLEASE leave room for dessert! The Satsuma orange ice cream (5/5) was incredibly tasty, and it's actually more of a sundae with marshmallow and pieces of honeycomb brittle. The cheesecake (5/5) definitely would be a nice choice as well, only I wish I had more!

Overall, I'm excited to return and try more food here - it really all sounds so interesting and delicious. The host was a little cold, but once inside we were well taken care of.

Wow. This place really brings it.

The menu is distilled down to the best hits and boy are they delicious. Our party of 4 ordered about 2/3rds of the dishes and everything was a stunner. The chefs even managed to hit it out of the park with a dish based off of a carrot.

What's equally amazing is the world-class bar menu seasonally crafted by Mr. Lind. It goes well beyond what you will get at a typical establishment of this caliber in NY. Its obvious the team is led by seasoned pros with some serious hospitality fire power.

Oh and on top of that, the service on bar and dining room is impeccable: attentive, perfectly timed and put us at ease to just enjoy a great 3-hour meal which felt like it passed in an instant.

I can't wait to go back.

I was very happy to see that Crown Shy earned a Michelin star this year because it is very, very well-deserved. I had dinner here on the Fourth of July - because that was one of the only days that had open dinner reservations at reasonable hours (the NY Times and NY Magazine review had *both* come out in June).

The entrance is kind of hidden - 70 Pine is a residential building and you have to walk inside the building to get to the restaurant. And in spite of the word ""Crown"" in its name, the restaurant is not located on the top floor as you might expect, but on the ground floor. Apparently, ""Crown Shy"" refers a phenomenon where the tops, or crowns, of trees don't touch each other, thereby forming a canopy filled with gaps. Contrary to what Pete Wells might think, I think the name is pretty clever and refreshing.

Now on to the important stuff - the food. It is absolutely delicious. We ordered: the red snapper crudo, gruyere fritters (which are more churro than fritter), white bean hummus with puffed bread, tagliatelle and grilled citrus-marinated chicken. While everything was good, the crudo, hummus and chicken were the real showcases of what Crown Shy can deliver.

I am particularly partial to crudo, but damn, the crudo here was phenomenal. The brightness of the citrus and the crunch of the sesame tuile maade for such an interesting and fantastic marriage of flavor and texture on the palate, I honestly would have been happy just to eat crudo for my entire meal.

The star of the hummus appetizer is not the hummus but the puffed bread. It's a really creative way to serve a bread course - it caters to the aesthetics of the Instagram crowd (I, of course, could not resist snapping a quick shot before digging in) but also doesn't disappoint in taste. There's a lot of butter or oil in it, as all good bread should have, and the softness and porousness of it is just made for soaking up dips and sauces like the hummus and the leftover citrus in my crudo.

As for the chicken, I almost never order chicken at restaurants but having read various reviews that rave about the chicken here, I just had to try. It's a whole chicken leg, with fingers and all, served with a few leaves of romaine, pickled vegetables and a hot sauce puree that was delightfully but not overwhelmingly spicy. The chicken itself is cooked expertly with an even amount of juiciness throughout.

For a Michelin star restaurant, the prices are decent - expect to pay around $150 for two with appetizers and drinks. I've certainly eaten at more expensive places with much less impressive food.

Wow this place got it. Under one year since it's been open and it has already recieved a Michelin Star. I been meaning to go since they first opened when I heard the executive chef of Nomad, James Kent, and one of the chefs from Eleven Madison are behind this new restaurant. However Crownshy is definitely the more casual and less stuffy sister than Eleven Madison with just about the same great food and fantastically in the affordable price range! The ambiance is playing top40s music of your pop & hip hop among the high ceilings.

My server was great at knowing exactly what to recommend from their menu. The free complimentary homemade bread was already a great start, absolutely bomb and addicting. Between my date and I, we started off with the gruyere fritters which were like amazing cheese churros. The fluke crudo was amazing, perfectly dressed and maybe the best fluke crudo I've had. The glazed farro with bone marrow and oxtail was also another favorite dish and we also had their known grilled chicken entree dish for main course. It was a very juicy chicken indeed though very spicy & citrus marinated. Even their desserts are fantastic. I also really enjoyed their cocktails too.

I definitely can't wait to come back already to bring my family! I think it's actually perfect if you come with four people since it's shareable and you can try more off the menu. The dishes are delicious and well executed all together. The price is very reasonable for the quality, service and dining experience you get. Highly recommend!!

Went to the Crown Shy for a holiday team lunch. Restaurant is located in a building which is easy to miss. We were seated immediately, it was pretty busy for a Wednesday afternoon. Waiter didn't come by for a while but we were greeted by a pushy sommelier (assuming that's what she was because she kept insisting on us buying a bottle of wine tho we preferred cocktails) The lunch menu is pre-fix $45pp, It must change frequently because I couldn't find any pics of the current selections

Food:
For starter I had the crudo, it was citrusy and delicious!
My colleges had the chicories which was pretty much a bowl of radish, nothing special
Entrees- I ordered the short rib sandwich, it was good but was more bread than short rib, I removed the top bun. The chicken is what everyone raves about, my coworker ordered this. It was good and tasty but nothing to write home about, not worth the hype! And it comes with the foot attached!!! The blue crab roll was also good but small, it's like a lobster roll, not a sushi roll.
All of the dessert choices were yummy, we each ordered a different one and tried them all!

Overall everything was pretty good, the lunch portions are pretty small tho, you won't leave stuffed or even full depending on what you order. Chicken was the biggest selection

Came for lunch. Food taste great, but it was definitely overpriced imo. I'd say mid 30s would be more appropriate.

The prix fix lunch comes with 3 courses (for $45). I selected:
-snapper appetizer. This was pretty tasty. Fish was fresh and the combination of flavors worked well
-short rib sandwich was really good. Short rib was cooked well. There were many different ingredients... I couldn't even tell what was included but it was delicious.
-as other reviews have stated, desert is served in a to go cup. We were able to still eat it in the restaurant. Got the blueberry sorbet, which was fine, but nothing special

I won't be back for lunch. May return to try out dinner though

Came here for a birthday dinner and am absolutely glad I did.
Victor served us and recommended how to plan our meal for the night. We started off with some cocktails and gruyere fritters. The cocktails here were amazing and would come back for them alone.
The carrots with razor clams were delicious and I understand why people order them.
I especially loved the octopus with chorizo.
The chicken was so juicy, highly recommend it.
For dessert, we got the sticky toffee pudding. It's the best dessert I've ever had.

I came here on a Wednesday evening. The ambiance is modern and elegant while being understated in a sense.

We started out with the Caramelle ($17), complimentary pull apart bread, hummus ($12), and gruyere fritters ($13).

The complimentary bread was soft and warm, I really enjoyed it. However, the dip that came with it, tasted like sour cream sort of and it wasn't my favorite.

The gruyere fritters sort of just tasted like cheese churros more or less. I did not find the type of cheese to be particularly palatable.

I really liked the hummus. It was a large portion and it paired well with the complimentary bread as well.

The 'nduja puffed bread was really the same as an Indian poori to me in terms of taste and texture. I really do love pooris though so I thoroughly enjoyed this bread.

I sort of felt it was problematic though slightly that the restaurant calls itself ""American New"" but it has Mediterranean hummus, Indian bread, Mexican churros as reference points but then it doesn't acknowledge those references with its names and titles.

The caramelle ($17) was light and yet creamy at the same time which is hard to achieve I feel. The corn in the dish was very salient in the flavor palette, which was unique but I'm not sure if I loved it or felt it was too pungent.

I also had the short rib ($59), meant to be shared by two people. I really think this was a winning dish. I loved that it came with quinoa, as well as multiple dipping sauces such as chimichurri. The braised ends made in horseradish and with potatoes was creamy and delectable. It was one of my favorite aspects of the dinner overall.

As dessert, I tried the Satsuma Orange ice cream with honeycomb and marshmallow. I have to say it was a beautiful dessert experience. I'm usually not even an orange flavored person but the tartness of the orange juxtaposed with the sweetness of the honeycomb and the warm and toasted marshmallow was really special. There was also a crunchy consistency to it with the honeycomb added which I liked. The whole dessert was very nuanced with its combination of pairings. My friend actually commented that she felt the desert menu was more creative than the dinner menu which I felt was an interesting comment.

One minor negative aspect for me was I asked for a coke without ice. It was given to me in a short glass, which was filled only 2/3 or 3/4 of the way. It just felt a bit stingy on their end, as basically they charged $5 for 6 ounces of coke.

The bathroom was European in its style and it allowed for more privacy than usual.

Overall, I really enjoyed my experience dining here and felt it had specific highlights in terms of certain dishes really shining.

Overall, I'd give a 4.5/5 to Crown Shy after having a super lovely experience celebrating my birthday here with my fiance! Normally, I have no reason to go all the way down to FiDi, but we had errands to run so I decided it was the perfect time to give this much-hyped place a try. Reservations were very easy to get - there weren't any available online, but we called a day ahead and were able to get an early Thursday dinner table.

The vibe of the place is super cool, e.g. Le Labo soap, APC-style staff uniforms, and a jazzy/hip-hop/chill playlist. Service is attentive but not fussy or formal. The menu, like the decor, is quite minimalist. Wine by the glass had just a few options per category, but I fairly enjoyed my Cabernet Sauvignon from Bordeaux. Restaurants of a similar price point can get away with charging for bread service, but Crown Shy's free (!) lemony, olive-stuffed pull-apart bread is some of the best free bread in the city, and comes with an addicting labneh spread. Couldn't help but get seconds of this.

As for food, the two of us shared two appetizers (red snapper crudo, charred carrots), the short rib for two, as well as the sticky toffee pudding for dessert. The crudo was good, although if it weren't for my current no-cheese policy (wedding diet), I definitely would've opted for the caramelle pasta dish instead. The charred carrots, which came with a foamy, clam chowder-like sauce-broth and razor clams, was also pretty good but again, I would probably try something different next time.

The real winner was the short rib, which cut like butter and melted in my mouth like a wagyu brisket. The accompanying chimichurri perfectly balanced each fatty bite. The side of burnt ends hidden under a silky layer of horseradish mashed potato was also amazing, and I would've ordered it as a standalone dish! The other side, a grains salad, paled in comparison with the rest of the dish, but the bites with sweet corn and fresh tomato were still a delightful, clean contrast to the richness of the meat. Do NOT skip on this dish.

As for dessert, the sticky toffee pudding was delicious, and so was the apple sorbet that came with it. They tasted better separately than together (the thickness of the toffee sauce is maybe too much versus light sorbet). Because it was my birthday, the staff also surprised us with a giant cupcake with a candle and adorably tiny crown. We had no room for the cupcake, so we packed it to go, and that became a delicious dessert for the following night!

Crown shy was amazing. You can't go wrong. If you have a large party make a reservation. If you have two of you they accept walk ins but you'll have to sit at the bar. Which is a great experience. The bar staff is so nice and lovely. Getting to know them was part of my experience. The food was so good everything we ate was explained to us and it was all Amazing. And most of the time you don't get dessert but you have to at the crown shy. The steak was to die for it's kind of pricey but so worth it. Loved will get stopping by again.

I have been waiting to try this place ever since I read the review from the New York Times. I have to say the service was impeccable.  The food came out in a timely manner and we really enjoyed all of the courses. I have to say, you have to try the short ribs. The other dishes we also had were on point but I'm pretty sure the menu is seasonal, so check it out and see what you think sounds best!!
I'm just going to have to warn you, I felt like the octopus was over cooked. I wouldn't order it again unfortunately.

I'm not sure why this place received two stars from the NY Times.

Let's start with the critically acclaimed Gruyere Fritters. Essentially, it's a single churro that's cut up and filled with a cheese sauce. These were terrible. First of all, the churro lacked flavor. Secondly, the cheese filling tasted nothing like gruyere cheese. Finally, for $14, I would have preferred to go to Costco for their $1 churro.

Other less-than-desirable items include the following:
White Bean Hummus and Grilled Bread - hummus was fine but the bread had the texture of a cracker. It was probably baked/grilled too long.

Charred Octopus, Red Rice, Morcilla Sausage - the octopus was nice but the rice was bland and hard. I'm not sure where the sausage was.

Grilled Citrus Chicken, Hot Sauce - the chicken was indeed citrusy but wasn't anything mind blowing. Hot sauce? We didn't see or taste any. What was really odd was the plating: the chicken was set to the side of the plate, so it looked like the chefs forgot to put something else on the side. Fail.

Short Rib, Braised ends, Sunchokes, Chimichurri - next to the fritter, this was the worst dish. It's probably because it was $71. Seventy-one dollars! Unbelievable. That comes out to about $6 per beef slice. What a rip-off. As for taste, there was nothing worth mentioning. It was just soft beef. Chimichurri? My friend makes a better sauce. Braised ends? It was in a small cup with some strange foam. Sunchokes? That was the highlight of the dish.

In conclusion, I would not recommend this place.

Nice outdoor area with plenty of seating and room between tables. Food was pretty good. The pepper turkey sandwich was a little lackluster, but the atmosphere and service made up for it. Mac and cheese was good.

Brooo The artichoke dip is to die for. It was hearty and gooey and just the perfect ratio. I think I could eat it once a week. Only wish was pita was flashed grilled or something but whatever.

I would also go as far to say the cocktails were very cheap considering it's in Financial District. I would have rate this place closer to one dollar sign than two.

Yes! Come here for Happy Hour, service is usually quick, the drinks are reasonably priced, the beverage choices are expansive, the space is cozy but not loud, and the location is very convenient for lots of FiDi workplaces.

But, I would say, do not come here for a meal or even bar snacks (beyond potato chips). They don't have fries or wings or any bar food to go with your drinks (which is usually fine by me, but just a note for others). The selection is pretty slim across the board (some salads and quiche). Though they do have a few sandwiches for lunch, which are good, but nothing special. The prices are high considering the portion size for the area, but not by much. A sandwich will set you back $18 (plus tax/tip). Service is standard, and the ambiance is nice.

Truly a great spot in the heart of the South Street Seaport area. Daily happy hour deals (even on Sunday) really seals a spot for me. It's cool spot to grab a drink at a table or hang at the bar. Great selection of wines and beers at a VERY reasonable price. The true star here came from another Yelper: the artichoke dip is probably the best version of this I've ever had or probably will eat. It came out hot, cheesy, creamy, and full of so much flavor and plenty of pita to go around. Looking forward to coming back here when the weather is better and trying some more delicious things on their menu and getting some more of those inexpensive drinks.

Came here for happy hour because I was in the area. They have deals on drafts and wine from 4-8pm. There are some seats outside but you have to go inside to order.

They also have a full food menu but I did not try anything.

The bartender was friendly and the place was pretty empty when I got there around 4:30 but by 6:30 it started to pick up.

Great find! Most happy hour places are so insanely crowded it's almost not worth the cheaper drinks. I will definitely be back!

I've been to Fresh Salt a couple of times in the past,  and when it comes to being in a comfortable environment to catch up with friends, this place does not fail to please.

First, finding a venue that has happy hour  isn't so easy in the vicinity, and theirs is quite good.
Happy hour specials run from 4 pm to 8 pm and it includes: $6 wine such as Rose, Sauvignon Blanc & Montepulciano as well as $5 draft beer and well drinks.
In addition, their craft cocktails normally $12 were $8.

There was no table service therefore orders must be placed at the bar for both food and drink---however, food was served to the table once ready.

We settled in the back part of the establishment but there were also seats at the bar and when the weather permits--outdoor dining.

Their menu in terms of food was simple but diverse: sandwiches, salads, dips for sharing (hummus & artichoke) and additional plates.

For drink, I selected Rose while my friends opted for the red.
We also ordered food upon which two of my friends chose the meatloaf sandwich while I went with the breaded eggplant sandwich.

Most entrees averaged at $12 with some less expensive items.
My sandwich was breaded eggplant (assuming it was fried) with mozzarella and pesto on a ciabatta bread.  I chose a salad rather than potato chips to accompany the delicious sandwich.
My friends enjoyed their meal very much.

Fresh Salt is a cute, homey type of establishment with good choices. Music seemed to be of the 60s genre all evening.

This place is an old reliable.

This place is incredible! We stopped in here after dinner for a drink and stayed for 3 hours!
Anne was our bartender and took great care of us! She knows how to move the crowd. She's passionate about her job and it shows- we appreciate that!
Her decision to take requests for one hit wonders really got people excited and jivey. It could not have been a more perfect night if she didn't play and dance to Oops! by Tweet ft. Missy Elliott.
Please come check out this perfect bar near the waterfront. Totally clean, energetic place and full of fun energy!

Cute little neighborhood spot in the seaport. Three of us came here last night after ice skating at Pier 17. It was valentines day so we knew a lot of the restaurants in the area would have been packed with romantic, date night vibes, and that wasn't what we were looking for, so this place was perfect. Low key, small restaurant.

There are no waitresses or waitress service, so you order everything at the bar. We got there right before happy hour ended which was great, so we got their Greenport beer. Not totally sure what it was, but their only HH beers were their three on draft, and she said that one was the most similar to a Bud Light, so it worked for us. This place has a very small menu, mostly sandwiches. I had the eggplant sandwich with pesto, mozzarella, and tomato on ciabatta and it was delicious. Really enjoyed it.

I didn't mind the no waitress service, and have been to plenty of places like that, but the only thing I didn't like was the bartenders weren't very friendly. It was not crowded at all, and when we ordered drinks and then again when we order food, we had to wait at the bar a bit bc either the bartender was taking shots, or talking or just not being helpful. Then when I was walking back to my table w 3 pints of beer, one of the bartenders, was just standing by the tables watching me, without offering to help. I don't think it would have been a big deal to help and it would have gone a long way.

I definitely would come back as I liked the food and it was a chill spot to hangout. There were also a bunch of other sandwiches I would have wanted to try.

Came here on a whim because the exterior looked cute, their food was really good! I ordered mac & cheese, and also shared some strawberry pancakes with my friend. Light and summery, the area is nice and welcoming.

They have a few tables for outdoor seating, which would be really great when it's nice out.

Love this spot! It's a charming little restaurant in the historic seaport district with a great ambiance. Nice music, not very loud in here.

Came for lunch, but I've also been here for brunch and happy hour. Great happy hour deal! The brunch menu is small but great quality food.

Ordered the chicken sandwich for lunch and it's fantastic. I highly recommend this spot for a nice, quiet meal!

I ordered from seamless around 530pm, and I'm not sure if the menu changes throughout the day, but not everything I saw on yelp was available to order. I ended up getting the eggplant sandwich with pesto, mozzarella, and tomatoes. I had to pick a side so I chose the Mac and cheese. Delivery was quick, and when it arrived it was still hot.

The sandwich was good and I would probably order it again. It wasn't too big or too small although I did end up eating the Mac and cheese right after. The Mac and cheese didn't impress me at all. The cheese wasn't really good, and it wasn't gooey and stringy, or creamy, the way I personally like it. Amy's microwaveable Mac and cheese is better.

If I had gotten a different side I would still give it three stars. Was happy with the delivery and the sandwich wasn't bad, but this won't be a go-to place for me.

My first time at the spot and it felt like home. Happy hour til 8pm! Thank you very much! The bartender Laila was lovely. I had margaritas with some co-workers and they were delicious. It was a blistering cold night on Friday. Taco plays was closed for a private event. Another bar around the corner let us down when we realized there waa no happy hour on Friday. (Really? You gone just br as our hearts like that? LMAO) And then...there was Fresh Salt. Like a beacon of light whispering...'come in...come in....' and then? We did! Drink we're awesome. It seemed like a really fun neighborhood or local spot. I chatted it up with a regular there and had a pretty great convo. It also smelled like they server food but I wasn't hungry. Cozy, warm, and it wasn't a huge bar but it was a intimate space. I'm definitely going back there again! Cheers!

Cute and simple, Fresh Salt a great place to stop in and have a drink or a bite to eat. I had their tuna salad on pita bread with a side of homemade sea salt chips, it was very good! The tuna was very tasty, it could have used just a tad more mayo; the pita was nice and fluffy so all together it was a solid tuna sandwich. The chips were lite and super crunchy, I really enjoyed them, they come in several flavors too. Great place whether you're on your lunch break or in the area.

Best drinks best food best ambiance best bartenders best servers never leaving you can't make me go. This is the only / bar restaurant in FiDi I will ever religiously go to. By the way the women servers are absolute fire  (specifically Dina and Ryan... dime pieces)

P.S. F the non dog lover who reviewed this place. They are friendly to humans and dogs alike eat a bar of soap thanks

Came here twice for their happy hour. They have a few tables outside to sit on a nice day. And a few tables inside. I believe their happy hour runs from 4pm until 7 or 8pm and no waiter service, must order at the bar. I mostly come here for the beer, they have a good IPA on tap that is cold and crisp and only 5 bucks during happy hr...cant beat that in the area!

Can't say much about the food as we only had the artichoke dip which was really not good.

Service from the bartender was friendly and fast.

I think this place is a cool bar to hang out in for after work drinks or maybe a date. It feels very cozy and has fun music playing. That being said, it isn't the best if you want a sit down dinner. First of all, table service ends after 4pm so you have to order everything at the bar and then get your own water, glasses, etc. the menu isn't huge, mostly sandwiches and salads.

I came for dinner after an outdoor concert at the seaport nearby and had been wanting to check this place out anyways. I ordered the turkey and Brie sandwich with a side of quinoa. The sandwich was pretty good- it comes on nice toasted whole grain bread. The turkey was cold though so it would have been nice if the whole sandwich had been grilled, not just toasted bread and then put together. The quinoa salad was ok, not bad but nothing special.

The drink I ordered, (I think the Beekman) was quite good though. If I were to go back it would probably be for happy hour since all the cocktails sounded really good!

I came here for a small birthday drinks. I liked the food (had a pita dip) ambience and seating of this place. Around midnight it wasn't packed but it wasn't empty either which was nice. The music was on point, too, contemporary hiphop played at a volume conducive for conversation. I was having a fun time until an interaction with the bartender. She sounded sarcastic and angry in response to my asking for a water refill and ordering a menu item. I felt as if I had stepped into a bizarro world as otherwise the place felt warm and friendly. It was the kind of behavior that my thought instinctively was that if I were a six foot man this would not be happening. As it was, I had to draw on that almost-40 wisdom and disengage from the bad vibes. But for this encounter, I would have given the place four stars.

Decent NY happy hour - for some outdoor seating and $6 wine you can't go wrong. You order at the bar and seat yourself. I don't think it is anything to write home about but if you are in the area it is worth the stop for a cheap drink!

Simple basic brunch.  But I think they are known for their speck. Speck is another word for hard core thick slab bacon. The atmosphere is charming. Great for neighborhood dedicated brunch spot but not a life changing experience.

Brunch menu is lean and basic.

I went there with my colleagues. I do very disappointed that they don't serve chicken wings. Which bar doesn't carry chicken wings? Excuse me? Also, more disappointed, they are lack of servants as well. They don't even have patience to listen if I will order alternative options. Little space. Long waiting. No one ask if you want anything.

Absolutely disappointed. I walked in my n a local night.. thay where rude and the bartender was disappointing. Thay preferred to treat it like their College dorm rather than a professional bar.
I was never offered anything special no particular appetizers or their specialty drink for the night.
$20 of disappointment.

I love that there is this completely not obnoxious spot nestled in a neighborhood rife with obnoxious bars.

Lush leather booths, smooth hard wood tables and bar, fresh flowers bursting out of bud vases, outdoor tables, plate glass windows for cheerful light in the daytime, and dim ambiance in the evening.

This is a great place to plan a get-together with a group of people. My friend had his law school graduation party here in the large corner booth and it was perfect. Also great for a summer evening date, paired with a walk on the water and a drink at the outdoor tables here. A good spot for a working lunch as well or a drink meeting.

The noise level is usually fine and the service is good. At peak times be prepared to wait a little. After table service hours end at 10pm be ready to bring your orders to the bar.

The craft cocktail section of the menu offers a full selection and specials are written on the chalk board on the far side of the bar.

A nice spot in a neighborhood whose selection of casual bars is overrun with bars catering to frat boys. Keep this one in your repertoire of places for dates, meetings, or just a nice solo cocktail.

My husband and I love to stumble upon new places to eat and drink while visiting the city, which is how we found FreshSalt while in Fulton Market.  We absolutely loved it.  We arrived shortly before brunch ended on Saturday afternoon, with the intent of getting a snack and some drinks.  We ended up splitting the Pepper Turkey on Ciabatta sandwich, which came with a small side salad.  It was delicious.  They also had another Pepper Turkey sandwich on their main menu.  The bunch version had fig and brie, whereas the main menu version has green apples, brie, and mustard.  I can imagine both are amazing, but I loved the fig jam.

For drinks, my husband stuck with beer, but I tried their cocktail, The Beekman, which was very refreshing for a bourbon based drink.  After that, I made the switch to wine.  Some may not like this, but I actually appreciated that they did not have a huge selection of wines, just three reds and two whites.  I think it makes choosing much easier.  I also could have easily picked another cocktail, as they all sounded divine.

Our quick bite and relaxing drink turned into a couple of hours enjoying Happy Hour with some regulars while sitting at the bar.  We genuinely had a great time hanging out and talking with everyone.  I love the feel of this restaurant, that it can be a great brunch location as well as late night bar spot.  I definitely hope to come back when we visit again!

Sometimes come here if I need a place for a fairly casual lunch and also seating.

They have a number of sandwiches which cost about $10 a piece. I've tried a few different types and have generally been pleased. Comes with a side of salad typically.

Service is fairly quick and also friendly.

Decent enough lounge type spot. Upon coming the first thing stated is that table service time is over so all orders have to be made at the counter. This is fine but ""Hi welcome to Fresh Salt"" sounds nice too. Looks a bit low on staff so it restricts the staff to food prep and drinks. I just went with a cocktail and the three cheese pita melt. Cocktail was ok and priced about right, pita melt was as described. Good but about what you expect at a tavern type spot. With a few friends this is the type of place to come for a drink or two before moving on to the main event. The ambience is dim with some eclectic music and is probably a bit more inexpensive than some of the other nearby spots but it's ok. Perhaps its a bit better for lunch, as it looks - a pass through spot for a few drinks.

We've been to Fresh Salt twice and each time great food, atmosphere and service.   The 1st time we sat at the bar for cocktails and small plates and it was nice. The 2nd time we got a table for 4 and had brunch.  When we're downtown again we'll definitely be stopping in!

Used to work here so maaaaaybe I'm biased but if you want an amazing Bloody Mary, look no further, you're going to get it here. Who needs bacon, shrimp, and all the frills?! Does come with pickled string beans though. Yummm. Dina and Layla make the best Bloody...hands down. I also happen to be drinking one at the moment. I'm sure I'll have another.
Great neighborhood bar. Great bartenders. Good food. Miss working here.

An ideal neighborhood spot, just as good for walk in brunch as it is for uncrowded late night drinks. The lack of crowds don't make it any less cool.

At brunch the croissant sandwich with thick cut (seriously thick!) bacon is my go to. Late at night for that last on-your-way home drink sit at the bar with the regular who knows the bartender.

It's casual and comfortable and just right.

After a nice cruise over at the seaport, was able to finally visit Fresh Salt after their brunch hours (that part of their menu looks lackluster). Space isn't very big, but not many people at 3pm on a Saturday, with indoor and outdoor seating.

Ordered the homemade meatloaf ($10) and substituted fries for mac n cheese ($3). Huge meatloaf with horseradish mayo served with lettuce on a sesame bun. Very filling meal, though could have used some more sauce (not much of a complaint). Mac and cheese was divine, nicely crisped on top and heavy cheese throughout. Meal would have been better with some hot sauce but was too hungry to care. Got a can of cider ($8) to wash it all down.

If this place isn't packed, a good spot as any for a filling meal.

Great place for brunch! We sat outside and they are super dog friendly. It's fairly limited seating outside.

Brunch Food: Mac n cheese and side salad is a good choice. It's a typical flavored mac n cheese served in a regular bowl. I'd highly suggest the SALT sandwich. It has a spice to it due to the chipotle aioli sauce but very good! It comes with a side salad and the sandwich has a lot of greens in it too and is pretty hefty. The speck they have in the sandwich is good. Parts of it were a little tough but for the most part tasty. There aren't any drink specials for brunch, so you have to pay regular prices for drinks but the moscato is always a good go to for brunch.

It seems they have good happy hour specials too, so looking forward to check out happy hour and have dinner here soon!

This place confused me... its very small and quite dive-y, but they only have three beers on tap and have a bunch of fancy signature cocktails. A friend and I came towards the end of happy hour. I was looking forward to getting some happy hour beer, but since they only have three options and none appealed to me, I opted for a glass of wine instead.

I'd read that the food here is good so we decided to try some sandwiches for a casual dinner. I got the eggplant sandwich with a side of mac and cheese and it was actually awesome and really filling. It seems that the food is the best thing about this place. After happy hour ended I decide to try one of their signature cocktails, the Beekman. It was pretty good but nothing special... this isn't really a place I'd choose if I wanted to drink cocktails.

They have a lot of tables but no table service after lunch so you have to go order all food and drinks at the tiny crowded bar which is not easy. Also there's only one unisex bathroom and its gross.

I tried to come here last year and it was PACKED.  So on a rainy Monday night, I made it happen.  The food was simple and delicious, the cocktails were yummy, and service was great.  The space was also super cute.  I would def go back to check it out - tho late night will be your best bet to get a table.

This is what I love about New York: small places that love what they do, and do it extremely well.

That describes The Brooklyn Heights Wine Bar & Kitchen to a ""T"".

Popped in during happy hour for a glass of wine and some nibbles.  Got a semi-dry Spanish white and probably the best rendering of baked brie that I've had in some time. Truly baked, with lingonberry jam, pistaccio nuts, and toast rounds. The cheese was actually hot enough that I had to let it cool, lest I burn my tongue.

My server, Hallie, introduced me to some other happy hour wines that were also impressive. The 45-seat place offers a 2003 Temperanillo Cabernet ... for $6 a glass!  How can you say no to a 16-year-old wine at that price? And no, it hadn't turned. It was round and smooth, and not TOO full. For $6? Pour me ANOTHER!

If you like wine and good, reasonably priced nibbles, try this place. Or don't. The rest of us will thank you for leaving us more room to enjoy this hidden gem.

Dan and I had ourselves a fun day out in Brooklyn and we came across this place walking back from the Botanical Gardens. We got a perfect quiet seat right by the window so we could people watch. We enjoyed a glass of wine with the BEST fig and ricotta crostini ever!! And to top it off the BBQ pulled pork chicken sandwich with crispy chips and side salad was just as great!

I come here out of pure necessity. The food is blah and if you just want a place to sit where no one will bother you - this restaurant or diner like establishment is a place to go. I cant even recall what I ordered - i believe the shishito peppers and chicken breast. It is a neighborhood spot but not an amazing menu to go gaga over

The $10 beer and burger happy hour deal has got to be the best in the neighborhood.

Plus, they have a bunch of beer/wine/cocktail options at $6 (HH is M-Th 4:30 to 7).

Bartenders are super nice. Space is cozy but not cramped.

I come here often from Manhattan because the
food is simply superb!

You cannot go wrong with any of the starters -
my favorites are the shrimp and chorizo tapas and
the lamb meatballs - and the beet salad is the
best I've ever had! For dinner I love the braised
beef ribs or the green pork chili. When I'm not
in the mood for meat, I go for the shrimp scampi
or the lobster coulibiac. Don't skip dessert! The
chef makes great profiteroles as well as daily
specials like the key lime pie.

People in Brooklyn Heights are lucky to have a
neighborhood joint with such yummy food!

Loved this place! Small but cozy. Service was great considering the place was packed and there were only 2 servers. All the food was delicious. I have he frittata, others had the burger, croque monsieur, salmon avocado blt and their biscuits.

The prices were very reasonable and the quality of food was excellent. We were a large party and they served all our food at the same time, hot and delicious.

You will not be disappointed if you find yourself wanted to visit this establishment.

We hope to be back.

Really glad we stopped in here!They have a great selection of wines and a welcoming atmosphere. The service was warm, and the food was delicious. I ordered the chicken coq au vin, which was moist, flavorful, and came served in a delicious cabernet sauce. It came out quickly and was extremely hearty and satisfying. Andrew, the chef, Derek, and Nur were extremely personable and friendly, and We really enjoyed our visit. I WILL be back!

Stopped by as a tourist on a Monday afternoon for a glass of wine (or two) and loved it! The wait staff was very friendly and attentive. We got a seat at the bar right away and the rest of the restaurant wasn't too crowded. I had a delicious glass of Matthew Fritz Chardonnay - bright but smooth and not too buttery and healthy pours!! The menu items looked great - will be back to try the curry chicken salad sandwich or baked Brie!

This is our FAVORITE BROOKLYN RESTAURANT no questions asked!! We love the large wine and whisky selections, the plates are well seasoned and delicious with every morsel devoured! The intimate ambience and location to Brooklyn Bridge and promenade is a perfect way in ending the evening experience!!

Lunch for my wife was an outstanding beet salad and, for me, a very simple salad, just bibb lettuce and their homemade dressing consisting of olive oil and champagne vinegar plus we shared a baked brie appetizer .... everything was delicious !! Their wine list is huge with a number of very reasonable priced wines by the glass but they have only 2 beers tap. We will definitely return.

It was a germ that we random bumped into. We were planning to walk on the Brooklyn bridge on Saturday and it was really gloomy and cold that day, so we decided to go into this lovely bistro to warm up.

We ordered a duck oil fried fries and an espresso. The fries were delicious.

We love the atmosphere of the bistro, warm and cozy. Highly recommended:)

It's been a long time that I was thoroughly disgusted by a meal, but Brooklyn Heights Wine Bar & Kitchen was awful. Unfortunately, my husband and I went for a long walk without our cell phones so we blindly choose to eat brunch here. What a mistake.
Michael ordered the fruit and granola yogurt parfait which came with unripe strawberries and a frozen brick of yogurt. I ordered the Croque Monsieur which was not served on sourdough bread but an un-toasted thin slice of rye, deli ham, a white glop of glue which they tried to pass off as a bechamel, and an unseasoned handful of salad. The bartender/waiter could see that we were not
thrilled and offered to have the ""chef""cook us something else, but the ""chef"" was no where to be found and Mike asked me to let it go. So, with a heavy heart, I let it go, tipped the server 20%, and walked out.
PS..... I found the ""chef"". He was sitting outside by the side of the restaurant in his dirty apron, talking on his cell phone. Go elsewhere my friends!

Reviews in here are mixes, but I am glad I just went in and gave it a try! I already knew by reading the reviews I could not trust those reviews *eye rolls when  I was reading them* - honestly it is very rare for me to leave a review but I felt I had to. Patrik (aka Patricio) treated me like royalty. I can tell his training in fine dining service. He was attentive and very very nice. If I happened to live here, and  wanted to go for something tranquil and comforting for a nice glass of wine and chill dinner, I would come here often. Again, really read the reviews and filter. Sometimes good businesses go down because of shity reviews.

A little gem off the beaten track from the Brooklyn Bridge tourists
Excellent food regardless of the limited menu
Check the special board for excellent additions i.e. lobster packed Mac n Cheese
Two for one Bloody Mary's are recommended

A nice small wine bar serving brunch, wine and cocktails in Brooklyn Heights.  With time in my favor I rejoiced life with some wine.  Quality wine with knowledgeable bar tender and friendly service.  Happy Hour is only from Monday to Fridays-- no weekends.  The location is very convenient to the A, C train High Street.  A business card is available for grabs.  When scanning their brunch menu the cheese plates and select entrees were appealing for a return.  I was actually carded as my face does not match my age:

Can I See Some Identification?
Ergo all bouncers scrutinize to the tee
To exam my photo, memorize my mailing address
All the while doubting the authenticity of my DOB to match my face
How my luck reeks to be carded
Here, there wherever I go
Stop glaring at me
Yes, we Asians hide our age gracefully

I opt for one glass of red wine with bar tender Pam's suggestion.
Syrah, Thalvin Syrah (Morocco) 2011 $11.00-  very subtle red wine of a gentle finish with oak and cherry.  I actually did tasted the oak and the sniffed bottom of the oak barrel.  It was fruity.

Cute place

On a search for some downtown Brooklyn brunch eats, we tried two other places in the area for brunch but they were too packed, so we decided to hit up this place. *I do not care how nice/well reviewed  a place is; waiting more than 20 minutes for a table is way too long in a place like NYC.*

This is a nice, small wine bar that has an adequate brunch menu and an above adequate wine and cocktail menu. The day that we visited, the place was not crowded at all and we obtained a table right away. The service was pretty fast and the food was in the mediocre to good range. I take it that the wine and spirits are this place's claim to fame. As the name of the place would suggest, it has an great list of wines and cocktails. Be aware that the majority of the wines are Italian, but the wine bar even has a couple of reds from Morocco, which I have never seen before. Maybe next time, I will try one of the Moroccan blends.

Most of the brunch dishes range in the 11-16 dollar range. I tried the Country Quiche, which I was a little disappointing, because it did not have too much of a taste of anything. It seems as if the smoked bacon was left out of the quiche. I had to add a lot of salt and pepper to the dish, because it tasted like air. Aside from the dish, I really enjoyed my Brooklyn Beauty cocktail, which contains my two loves, gin and ""bubbles"" (prosecco).

Based on some of the previous reviews, I did not have an issue with the service at Brooklyn Heights Wine Bar & Kitchen.

I would give this place another shot, because of its extensive cocktail menu, which has mostly gin- and whiskey-based beverages. Hell, I may even through another glass (or three) of wine to that mix.

Afternoon at the Brooklyn flea market. BHWB is like the shirpas at base camp. Climb the hill a little to get to the Brooklyn Bridge walking path. The find this place to get you ready for the walk back to Manhattan. Or laugh at the people who need less blood in the alcohol stream after the crossing.

Check the specials for some good options.

What a jewel of a find. Wanted to walk the Brooklyn Bridge and needed to grab a quick lunch.
The salad was great I was told and I had the smoked bacon Mac and Cheese. One of the best Mac and cheese dishes I have had. Small place but worth it.

I visited this small resto bar on New Years Eve and it was quite crowded by the time I arrived. I was really surprised by how small the place is.. although the ambience and vibe was really good. The menu had way less options to choose from. I ordered a garden vegetarian lasagna which was on the menu for that day. The quantity was way too less for the price.. but it was absolutely delicious. I give special appreciation to the chef. Overall, although the place is pricey and small, I would definitely visit again only for the food and service.

Good menu and drinks selection.

Not accommodating to birthdays--it was very offensive to the person who's birthday we were celebrating that we couldn't light a candle for their birthday. We even called the restaurant ahead of time.

Service is also slow.

Good food, great Service (thanks Patrick) the only missing star is for the restaurant's physical conditions.  Needs a bit of upgrade.  Instead of waiting in lines at dumbo, walk up a little and enjoy the food and the chat with Patrick.

SO happy I stumbled upon this place.
Happy hour beer and wine priced at $6!
Small plates were great.
One of the best burgers I've ever had- didn't even have to add ketchup or anything. Seasoned and cooked to perfection.
Dishes came out in a timely fashion & the waitress was so kind!

I have had some excellent food here and some mediocre food here.  I give four stars because even the mediocre meal was an extremely pleasant and unpretentious.  The pozole, devils on horseback, French fries, Cobb salad, and chicken walnut salad were all excellent.  The charcuterie was not.

After a chilly walk over the Brooklyn Bridge on a Saturday afternoon, needed a quiet place to warm up and have a light snack. This spot is relatively closeby and a bit more inviting than the usual dimly lit wine bars.

Got a half-carafe of Montepulciano ($27) and a side of Home Fries ($4). The dark red was perfect after freezing our asses off outside, especially sitting next to the window and seeing others trying to brave the cold while we got warm. Home fries were nicely seasoned, going well with the red.

Service here is solid. They didn't try to rush us out despite just having a side and a drink. Although I don't come around this area often, I'll make a note if needing a spot to relax.

Nice small restaurant  with wide selection of wine and whiskey. I had a really tasty and well cooked lunch for $15 half chicken panini and hot peas cream soup.  The other choice was portobello panini and cold cucumber soup.
Clean, nice, fare prices, well served and the most important - tasty food!
Also need to admit a very convenient location close to the A train subway station. Good alternative to the Italian pizzerias at Old Fulton district just 5-7 minutes walk away.

Who: my boyfriend and I
When: may 28,2017 after the corgi Meetup on the hillside dog park, brunch time
Why: hungry after petting all the dogs

This place takes FOREVER at everything. Service was unbearably slow, it took 10 minutes after sitting down for someone to take out order (2 paninis). Then, it took over 45 minutes for our food to come out (during which time our water was not refilled). The food itself was fine but really something I could have gotten from any deli. Overall unimpressed.
Wouldn't come back.

Love this place! Great place to have dinner on a random week night, where you won't feel guilty for spending a fortune. This place is neighborhood, and cozy and delicious! My favorite meal is by far the boar ragu! It's amazing,really! The gnocchi tastes like delicious little pillows that are perfect to absorb the deliciously slow cooked sauce while the boar simply melts in your mouth. Their wine selection is respectable, and a good value. The service has always been great as well.
Definitely a place you want to put on your regular rotation!

Great place to chill. The wines are a great value, atmosphere is perfect with all the big windows. The samples of toasts and the pates are great options for complimenting your wine buzz.

I have some great memories of spending hours and hours here.

Never had the brunch, but sounds like it's not so great from other reviews. This place is meant for long evenings with wine. The food is simple and good but not the main show.

A little piece of Amalfi, Italy, I am told by the company I'm with, who've been to Italy few times. In other words, this is the real thing, not the Americanized version.
Our only mistake is that we came for drinks and desserts after having dinner in another place.
We had Aperol  Spritz- about 2 each. The best drink for a hot summer night post COVID, outdoor dining.  We had two gelatos, hazelnut and pistachio. WOW. The hazelnut was like eating frozen nutella and the pistachio was absolutely amazing, delicate, flavorful, creamy yet not heavy. Delicious. My dessert was on the savory side... yes, just didn't feel like something sweet. I had an appetizer that I never heard of nor tasted before: Shaved artichoke hearts with shaved parmigiano and olive oil. That was an amazing surprise in every bite. It was crisp,  lightly salted, and you could taste the quality of the EVOO, but it wasn't greasy,  and the parmigiano of the highest quality.  A day later, as I am writing this review, I still have the delicate, superb taste in my mouth, making it watery again... :) This one came with bread and olives in olive oil to the table... the best quality of olives and olive oil... again!
Service was amazing. Attentive and friendly and so welcoming and relaxing. Some places these days, make you feel you should rush so that more business could come in. Not here. Taking your time, the Italian way.
As I said initially, our only mistake was that we didn't have dinner here (and not because our diner wasn't good). So we definitely will come again.
P.S. Because of COVID, they sanitize the restroom between users. That was impressive to me, as I didn't expect that, as the lady informed me I'll have to wait for her to sanitize before I go in. So... extra point for cleanliness!

We came here for Valentine's Day- our first time going out for the holiday (we usually cook) so we were excited for the celebration of it all. That being said I give this place and experience three stars- okay, fine even but not good or great.

Our reservation was at 9:30 pm and after arriving a few minutes before, we were surprised to see 4-5 other couples crammed into the tiny front entry still waiting for their reserved tables as well. A few more came in after us as well and we ended up not being seated until 10 pm. To be fair, there was a table available by the bar five minutes before we ended up sitting but at this point of waiting, we thought what's a few more minutes for a nicer table by the window. That bar table actually ended up leaving because the server never came to their table. So not a good start.

Once we were sat at the nice table by the window, we also had to wait about ten or so minutes for water and a server. We placed our orders from the pri fixe menu right away because at this point we were very hungry. Annoyingly, the meal was poorly timed by the restaurant. Our appetizers came out at the same time as the starter bread basket and olives, then the wait between these and the meal was about 30 minutes.

For appetizers, I ordered the quail and Beebs ordered the polenta. I've never had quail before and it was nice to try something new. Both were good dishes. For main course, he had the steak and I had the lobster linguine. Both dishes came out on cold plates which if you know anything about food, is a recipe for disaster if you're having a hot meal. Also the mashed potatoes they came with his steak or lukewarm. My pasta was definitely forgettable. The lobster and the linguine were both under season and lacking flavor.

When we finally got desert (which was also another long wait), this was probably the redeeming part of the meal. I got the pine nut tart and he got the tiramisu. The tiramisu was fine- definitely not the best I've ever had but my pine nut tart was delicious. It was crunchy and sweet from honey. A much needed plus after a forgettable meal.

Well this is all happening, we had the server come over one time in the entire meal to check if everything was OK. The staff was friendly when they were attentive but they were barely attentive so it's not saying much. So definitely not worth the hassle if there is a hassle to come to this place. There's plenty of other good Italian spots you can go to for a much more memorable meal.

This is a ""mom and pop"" Italian restaurant with extensive wine selections. It had rustic charm, beautiful that lovely. Such a warm, romantic space for a perfect date! It is a rather small space, but they do have another room downstairs, which can be used for a private event.

We had a few appetizers to share; Burrata con Pomodoro e Basilico, and Ravioli di Mele. Burrata dish was fresh and tasty, refreshing on a hot, steamy day. Ravioli had a nice sweetness to it, packed with flavor!

We also had their infamous Carciofo alla Romana, which is a Braised Artichoke. It was unique and impressive. The heart was almost creamy, melt in your mouth.

They had a few special of the day, and one of them was lasagna. We didn't order it, but we got a small sample, and it was soooooo good!

For main, I chose Spigola al Forno, a 'Whole' Mediterranean Sea Bass It came out beautiful! One of the owners, Michelle, filleted it for me right there. The first bite of the fish gave me such joy...it was absolutely delicious! We enjoyed this dish very much!

My hubby went with Agnello in Crosta di Pistacchio, a Sicilian Pistachio Crusted Roasted Rack of Lamb. It had a great crunchy exterior with plump and juicy inside. Packed with flavor, tender and very satisfying.

We ended with Tiramis√π and Torta di Cioccolato. It was one of the best Tiramis√π and flourless chocolate cake I've ever had!

We had an amazing dinner here, I am so happy to have discovered this restaurant! Everything we had was superb, we enjoyed them all from the first bite to the last. Our main server, Valentine, took a great care of us. If you want to have some authentic, delicious food with family and friends, or have a very romantic date, this might be the perfect spot for you!

I usually order in from them but decided to take advantage of a beautiful Wednesday night to enjoy outdoor dining. They have done a marvelous job with the outdoor set up making it both safe and inviting. The food is even better straight out of the kitchen!!!! Burrata was creamy and who knows how they got such good tomatoes this late in the season, the duck raviolis were the perfect combination of savory with a touch of sweet and then came the tiramisu ..... why haven't I ever ordered this before. Note to self - always save room for desert here. A great dinner out overall and a great spot on 5th!

This restaurant WAS amazing at one point in time. What's happened recently to this place is beyond me but my experience last week was the worst experience I've ever had at any restaurant especially one that I frequented on a regular basis. I called earlier in the week explaining that it was my fianc√©es 50th Birthday and that he's been dreaming of their lamb. I wanted to take him out for a special night and wanted to make a reservation. I was told ""No Reservations"" but that we'd be taken care of. So confidently I went last Saturday only to be greeted by their rude and nasty hostess. She insisted that we sit at the one and only table that was literally in the street completely separate from the outdoor seating (mind you there were 4 empty tables despite the 2 guys sitting in a table for 4). She looked at my fianc√©e up and down and gave him a dirty look while I was speaking to her - MY fianc√©e is African American -  she didn't even look at me as I spoke! I asked the woman nicely if she could sit us inside the seating area and she said 'No, that's for reservations'. I told her nicely that I was confused because I called earlier in the week and tried to make reservations and was told that they didn't make reservations. She stuttered and said well those tables are for parties of 4. I pointed to the 2 gentlemen sitting at the table for 4. I asked 'then why are those guys and that couple sitting at the tables for 4?  She gave me the BS that the guys were ""Regulars"".  Again I asked 'So I have to be a regular to get a table?! That doesn't make sense. I called earlier this week to make sure I didn't have to go through all this back and forth. It's my fianc√©'s birthday and all I want is for him to have a special dinner.""  My fianc√© whispered to me 'Let's just go somewhere else Babe.' She then said rudely ""Fine! Sit where you want!"" I was SO TAKEN A BACK! But sat down because I really didn't want to mess up my fianc√©es night or cause a scene. The hostess glared at us all night and made me so uncomfortable that I regretted ever going there. The famous lamb he wanted  - HORRIBLE!!! No day or flavor. We ordered the shrimp appetizer - No flavor or salt. I had the broiled fish and also no salt or flavor just a fish sitting in 2 inches of olive oil. I wasted $150 for the worst dinner and experience I've ever had. If it wasn't for my fianc√©e I would've just picked up and left. NEVER AGAIN!!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY HERE -

I wrongfully assumed that I could stroll into any Italian restaurant and find vegetarian options,  never on the Secondi section but definitely under Primi...such was not the case here.  The only vegetarian entree on the menu is the spiach gnudi which was very good if you're into spinach as the flavors definitely stands out above the asiago sauce and cheese.

Service was average, they were not willing to make any modifications to accommodate, I really wanted to try the ravioli and was hoping they could omit the duck ragu but I was told that wasn't possible.  When we ordered wine they only brought over one of two glasses and when we asked for the check we were told the dessert menu haha.

The ambiance was quiet, super cute for a date night and I'm pretty sure we were seated next to a couple on their first date which speaks to the vibe.  It's a dark, romantic, and cozy establishment.  Which I didn't mind at all.  If they update the menu I would definitely come back and likely give it more stars :)

So this review will be off of lack of communication or intrest of the hostess.  Who cared nothing for the overflowing of people in the doorway of the restaurant making it a hazard for servers to move around and guest to get in n out of their seats.
A 9pm reservation was greeted with a ""give me one moment, to they will be done with dessert  soon "" to her disappearing after the influx of people came into the door with the same time frame for reservations. Now there is a huge wait and no answer on when we will sit.
In reviewing the food there wasnt a ability too I have heard good things about this place and date night got turned into pizza night. Suck!!

Better handling of reservations and better communication so you dont have a safety issue on your hands at your front door. A phone call would have be a quick way of giving people a heads up of delays.

Hopeful to try the food let see what happens... to be continued

I'm so happy to have finally come to this restaurant! The food all around was absolutely delicious. We started off with the burrata, always great. We then shared the Tagliatelle and Agnello (rack of lamb). The tagliatelle was simply delicious. The ragu was perfectly seasoned. The Agnello was a very nice surprise flavorwise. I think the pistachio crust created a nice texture with the lamb. We ended our meal with the tiramisu and ginseng espresso. The tiramisu was so good. Absolutely perfect. The ginseng espresso really blew my mind. I'd never had ginseng espresso and I'm glad I decided to try it out! highly recommend. I'll definitely be coming back!

A hidden gem for sure. I must have passed this place a hundred times, but it looks more like a Brooklyn antique shop than a restaurant from the outside. Came here for my girlfriends birthday dinner and everything from start to finish was incredible. The inside is very cute and cozy. Our waiter was incredibly helpful and helped us pick not only a bottle of wine but food as well, and he couldn't have done a better job. Wine was delicious, and the food was incredible. Can't wait to go back.

My boyfriend and I had a date night here last weekend, and I was so glad we picked this spot for dinner. When we got there it was (understandably) very busy, so we had to wait, but the hostess got us drinks while we sat. I had a spinach salad and a ragu pasta dish, and both were incredible. I had the tiramisu for dessert, and while some tiramisus I have had just aren't worth it, this one was delicious. I have always really cared about the atmosphere of a restaurant, and although the beautiful interior was closed for dining, the outdoor seating was very pretty and pleasant. Will definitely be going back!

Every dish we had here was nearly perfect. Oozing deliciousness. The food was not-quite-familiar, seemingly influenced by many countries around the mediterranean, maybe with Italy dominating. It all felt like nostalgic home cooking--but from an alternate reality in which you grew up in Italy, Spain, and Portugal, and your mom was a brilliant chef.

It's also just about the nicest space I've seen for a Brooklyn storefront restaurant. The dining area downstairs is especially inviting, with glowing light, a cool breeze, and the comfort of being surrounded by floor-to-ceiling wine on all sides.

Wonderful owner who was a pleasure to speak to. The food and wine selections are superb. We had a 6:30 dinner reservation for six. Was seated at about 6:45 due to a couple finishing up. Once seated, menus, apps, wine and entrees flowed seamlessly. It was great.

What a beautiful and cozy place.
It's feels like you are truly back in Italy.
Everything is amazing, every single salad on the menu is amazing, every appetizer is amazing, every hot dish is amazing. You don't have to think too long, just take one of each and you will absolutely enjoy every bite of it.
And when you will come again order other dishes and you enjoy even more then first time.
No wonder this place was featured in New York magazine as one of the most popular places in Park Slope for past two decades.
PS You must try their Braised artichokes and Octopus salad, but ask for less onion...lol

I hate writing bad reviews, but the way the manager/owner treated us was ludicrous.
When i walked in, the first thing he said (older Italian guy smelling repulsively like cigarettes and not knowing what personal space is) was to ask me how I spelled my name after he clearly had it written in from of him on my reservation. Didn't really pay much attention as it happens often. The only table they had was upstairs where there were several crying babies, so I asked if they had a table downstairs, he said no and proceeded to convince me the table he is giving me was the best in the restaurant. I said can you give us a minute to decide and we sat down. 3 mins later he comes and I told him we decided to stay and his response was 'well, don't feel like you are doing me a favor staying. If you don't like it you can leave  I feel like if you aren't 100% happy with the table maybe this is not a good fit for you and you can find another place'
What a salty man, If I were with guy friends I was gonna tell him exactly how I felt and the way he spoke to me was unacceptable. But I composed my self and told him, thank you for your hospitality, hope you treat others better.
The food could be good, but if someone gets in your face and is being rude with you in front of a lady, a bad review is the least he deserves.

We are so glad we picked this place for our anniversary. Family owned and run, and you can tell everyone truly cares about your experience.

*Bread and olive oil was yummy
*Grilled octopus - delicious
*Apple & cinnamon ravioli with duck ragu - exceptional
*Sardinian Pasta with Housemade Berkshire Pork Sausage in Tomato Sauce - very yummy, great flavor
*Blueberry & coconut crumble pie - perfect dessert, light but delicious

The decor is rustic and warm. Fairly small so be sure to make a reservation.

This place has been on my list to visit for ages and was really looking forward to it after seeing the high ratings it gets.

Unfortunately we were left disappointed. The place could be great but too many things fell short of expectations on the night we visited.

We asked for the dessert menu before ordering as that always helps me decide what to have for other courses, as soon as I was told there was panna cotta on offer, I was sold - my favorite

We ordered the chicken livers to share as a starter and the lamb chops and gnocchi gratinati al forno for mains.

The chicken livers are complimented by lovely flavors that I have not tried with them before - balsamic reduction, onion and pancetta. However the overcooked and dry livers made the dish less enjoyable than it could be.

We waited over 30 minutes between our starter being finished and the main coming out despite the fact that we ordered all at the same time. This was annoying as the restaurant was quite empty and people who came in and ordered after us had already received their food.

When the mains came, the cauliflower accompanying the lamb was cold and the gnocchi was bubbling hot, way too hot to eat. The lamb was perfection, probably the best lamb I have had but cold cauliflower took away from overall enjoyment! The gnocchi when it eventually cooled down was delicious as well.

For dessert we had the tiramisu and panna cotta. The tiramisu was very good. The biggest disappointment of the night was the wobble free over set panna cotta, why why why??? The flavors were good but the consistency was off and another dish fell short.

With desert I had a coffee, some instinct said open the milk jar.. and there were green bits floating in the milk, once pointed out it was replaced.

I doubt we will be back, too much better on offer in the area to risk another okish experience here

I have gone to Italy and ate such delicious Italian food and was never able to find that in New York- until I came to this place. My boyfriend brought me here for our anniversary and the food blew my mind. I got the Gnudi and it was absolutely delicious. We also had the artichoke appetizer- which was really good and melted in your mouth. Our server was so wonderful too. All in all- I highly suggest this place! Especially for a nice romantic date

Excellent Italian food, intimate and interesting interior, and good service. I had the duck ragu with apple cinnamon ravioli and it might have been one of the most memorable dishes and flavors I've ever had. I do recommend making a reservation because the main dining area is small; we went on a weeknight with a reservation and the place was full the whole time we were there.

I must have some really great friends because they brought me here for my birthday after I insisted I didn't need a celebration. Little did I know I would have a piping hot Italian meal and a piece of to-die-for flourless chocolate cake to end my 23rd year. Lucky me.

Convivium is rated as one of the best restaurants in Park Slope, which I cannot disagree with. Situated in the heart of 5th Ave, CO stands out among the rest. With copper pots and pots hung on the walls and rustic decor and brick throughout, you'll feel like you're getting the real Italian experience here.

For appetizers, we had the burrata and the meat/cheese plate (tagliere di salumi e formaggi). They were both very fresh and delicious, though I did think the serving sizes were small.

We all ordered pastas (primi) for dinner. How could you not? The gnudi di ricotta e spinici was a plate of 15 or so gnudis, a fluffly, light as a feather puff of pasta. Wow. The ricotta was thinned to a sauce, almost resembling a bechamel.

The sausage pasta (malloreddus con salsiccia) was second on my taste test, and I have to say it was also delicious. The sweet sausage was a surprising twist among the pecorino cheese. I still rated mine higher, but yum.

Last but not least was the tagliatelle al rag√∫, a fancy way of saying spaghetti with meat sauce. This was 3rd on my rankings, but still okay. I wasn't disappointed, but the flavor in the sausage pasta was more complimentary and went done easier.

Overall the staff was wonderful and took very good care of us. We had several bottles of wine among the 5 of us and we never had an empty glass. We were all quiet after being served, which my father always said is the best sign of a good meal.

Mangia!

I actually loved this place when I went. I wasn't expecting much since I was on a date but the venue really got me. It's actually close enough that you can visit before or after an event at the Barclays.

The decor of wood, old lights, and copper gives this place a warm vibe. If you want something a little more private, they have private room downstairs.

It's a good option for casual or formal occasions.

Disappointed to say the least. I could not begin to review the food because in the cadance of Saturday night dinner that was one part we had not reached before I decided to write this review.
Step 1 in the cadance..review,and research to determine reservation choice.
Step 2 make reservations
Step 3 Travel
Step 4 arrive and converse with hostess.
Then come the wait . The overcrowded wait for the table that was never received.
When recieved by the hostess she appeared to be underwhelemed by her overwhelming situation. They where clearly overbooked and clearly unable to manage.  The hostess espressed little attention to any concern of the mounting wait for a table. After being smooshed into the restuarant and ignored for over 10 minutes I had sadly decided to leave.
Hospitality was greatly lacking and the owner, manager, hostess whomever she was is i great need of revisiting the training for her position.

This review is for a dinner last week in the private dining room downstairs here.  I have done private dinners on a regular basis for work and I would say that Convivium stands out as an excellent experience.

Too often the danger of the private room is that you are out of sight and out of mind.  Here I didn't feel that we were forgotten at all.  Once our guests arrived, our server announced the courses and the entree choices.  Before our program started, she took everyone's order and everything flowed smoothly from there.  There was a nice variety of appetizers and everyone seemed to enjoy their entrees.  There was a point when we were ready for the entrees to show up and once we asked and they were on the table within a few minutes.

Private rooms often look like boring conference rooms, but having dinner in the downstairs room here is like eating in a wine cellar.  Strike that, you are actually eating in a wine cellar.  The owners obviously pride themselves on providing an authentic Italian dining experience and when you eat in this room, you can imagine being in a tasting room of a winery or villa in Italy.  All of our attendees were thrilled with the dinner and stayed well after the program was done, an indication of much they enjoyed their experience.

Our appetizers were served family style and included the baby kale salad with endive and cherry tomatoes; polenta with oyster mushrooms and taleggio cheese; grilled octopus; and a plate of smoked meats, cheese, and marcona almonds.  The servings were quite generous for the table, but folks had no problem clearing their plates.

Our entrees included red snapper prepared perfectly; gnudi with ricotta and spinach; rack of lamb; and Cornish hens.  Most of the people at the table ordered the fish, but everyone raved about their main dish.

For dessert, we got to try four different desserts. The flourless chocolate cake was divine and the apple tart was exceptional. Likewise the panna cotta was perfect and the berry tart was delicious.  Together it was a fantastic ending for a wonderful meal.  Thank you!!

When I was looking to set up this dinner, I had a hard time finding a spot in Park Slope that could accommodate a large group and would be a draw for potential attendees.  Convivium met the bill on both counts and was very responsive in setting up the event.  If you are looking for great spot with outstanding service for a private event, I can recommend Osteria without hesitation.

Like stepping off of 5th Ave. in Brooklyn and straight into Italy.

I'm not sure how I will be able to handle having two new favorite places in one month, but I will try to persevere.  Side note: this place is a few blocks from my apartment, so I've passed it on the street for the past four months, but never went inside.  I regret it now, but plan to make up for it.

The first thing you notice when you step inside is the decor.  It's very authentic Italian and cozy.  We were greeted by an Italian woman and seated on time for our reservation.  We were offered the wine menu while waiting for our table at the bar, which was subsequently brought to our table when we were seated.  We ordered a bottle barbera, which was delicious.

For the first course, we had the burrata.  It was not the best burrata I've ever had, but still very good.  For the main course, I ordered the Green apple, ricotta, and cinnamon housemade ravioli with Peking duck rag√∫. Yes, it's as good as it sounds. My friend ordered the housemade tagliatelle with beef and veal rosemary rag√∫, which was also insanely good.  I really love that all the pasta we ordered was made in-house.  It definitely took the flavor up a notch.

I noticed a lot of negative comments about the service, but I have to say, the service we experienced was pretty good.  The staff was attentive and I loved that the server was Italian.  The owner (also Italian) attended to our table as well.  The food was timed perfectly and we were never waiting for anything.

I will be back here as much as possible.

This place was very interesting! The environment is eye-catching and the restaurant is cozy! This place was recommended to me while I visiting here in the Brooklyn, And I always like to give at least one place that's recommended to me a try before I go and explore other places I've read
The vibe is pretty cool here the music is loud and in Italian. I came with my dad to eat here after a rough day in the hospital visiting my grandma so maybe it wasn't the best setting that we were looking to be in but that's not the restaurants fault.
But as a date or going out with friends this place would be perfect, especially if you don't mind the loud music.

The prices are fine, the lasagna was tasty,
My dad really enjoyed his lamb chops and we both thoroughly enjoyed of the Burrata. The polenta wasn't our favorite item.

All in all pleasant and interesting experience!

So disappointing.  We've been here twice before for parties and decided to host a family birthday party here.  Lovely interaction while making a reservation.  We were seated next to the door and were so cold with people opening the door coming in and out.  But with the food.  For apps, we had the tomato and mozzarella, octopus and a few salads.  Nothing was spectacular.  For the mains, the ribeye, the duck ravioli, the tagliatelle, and gnocchi.  The gnocchi was gross - very mushy, all else was decent.  Nothing was outstanding.  The dessert was the best part - had one of all and it was delicious.

So for this caliber of a restaurant (and equivalent price tag), we were disappointed. Don't know whether they were having an off-day, but we did not enjoy our dinner.

When I lived in the neighborhood 20 years ago and this place opened, it seemed unattainable- I was perpetually broke and this seemed both fancy and pricey. Now, in middle age, I realize that while it is more expensive than some offerings, these were missed opportunities to enjoy exceptionally good food, well prepared in an environment that transports you instantly to an Italian restaurant in the mountains of Puglia or a valley in Tuscany.

The dishes are simple and the wine is profound. They serve a spinach and ricotta gnudi that melts in your mouth, and a carciofi alla Romana that reminds me of trying that dish in Rome the first time. The upstairs space is small, but there's both a back garden and a large room in the cellar, surrounded by their excellent wines. Everything from beginning to the last bite of homemade, light as air tiramisu is delicious. Go and enjoy.

Whilst searching for a new dinner spot in downtown Brooklyn, Convivium caught my eye. With old school tavern-ish interior decor, the cozy little Italian restaurant seemed like a perfect pick for the night. I had reservations for a party of 2 at 8:30pm on a Thursday and was seated right away. The place filled up pretty fast afterwards. The waiter told us the special of the day and there is also a wine special on the board. They served bread with a small bowl of delicious olives in olive oil. I started off with the grilled octopus and a glass of Chianti red. The octopus was amazing although one or two more pieces would've been great. Convivium certainly has a great wine selection available. For the main course I had the whole roasted Mediterranean Sea bass with Swiss chard. The fish size was good and the fish itself was tasty. There were more little bones in the fish than I had anticipated. Overall great Italian spot that brings you back to the roots of Italy.

This is our second time in this restaurant. It's a very warm, cozy restaurant with a great wine list and an even better food menu. I strongly recommend the seared scallops to start , the ravioli of the season with apple fillings is amazing and the rack of lamb - simply awesome. Even though we didn't have an reservation for a Friday night, we were really pleased to know that waiting time was like 30mins so we could get a drink first at the bar before dinner. Service was really attentive all around and was delighted with such a wonderful dining experience. It's a pity they don't do lunch anymore but I hear brunch may be in the offing soon!

You can make a reservation for up to 8 people on Opentable. It is a large space with a big basement for seating. They can accommodate large groups but don't have high chairs for children. We tried the liver, lamb chop, gnudi, octopus and several of the pastas. All of the food was pretty good with my favorite being the octopus.

My fianc√©e and I celebrated our engagement at Convivium. I originally had my doubts on this restaurant based on another review. After reaching out to the restaurant on their website, the owners contacted me and we later spoke on the phone to clear things up. I appreciate that kind of response and am happy that we celebrated here.

We made reservations online and our table was ready when we arrived. The ambiance is very comforting and the staff is friendly. Inside the restaurant, you feel as though you are in an old European village. We started with an organic Montepulciano which was great across the board.

Appetizers: we started with the Octupus and the Braised Artichoke. We loved the octopus, though we would not order the artichoke on our future visits as it was a bit heavy on the oil.

Pastas: we ordered the Squid Ink Linguini and the Ravioli with Peking Duck Rago. Both were amazing. The ravioli and duck together created an amazing flavor.

Dessert: we finished our wine with a generous platter of cheeses which we recommend.

Overall experience: lovely

Would I recommend to friends? We've told at least 10 people about our amazing time at Convivium.

Can't wait to go back to try other dishes.

I've been coming here for years now and they never disappoint.  Atmosphere is warm and cozy. Lots of knic-nacks and they're never dusty. Seafood and game dishes are the winners here. Clams in the pot with chorizo my favorite . Kool neighborhood spot.

Here's the problem with Convivium Osteria: one of their dishes is so incredibly delicious - so craveworthy and perfect - so wonderful that every time we go we cannot help but order it.  Everything on the menu is so tempting - and I want to try it all - but even when I go with the intention of trying more things, I always default to the favorite.

It's the Porterhouse steak - for two.  To. Die. For.  We'll generally order one of the lighter appetizers to share as a starter (the steak comes with crispy rosemary roast potatoes and a perfectly dressed salad of delicate greens) - but the rest of the exceptional menu is neglected because of the incomparable steak.

We've managed to work around this ""problem"" by bringing friends with us to ""double date"", allowing us to ""share family style"" some of the delectable pastas and fresh seafood delights (whether they planned on it-or not).

Would you like to join us?

Just kidding!

The service is always warm and attentive - you feel like you're a guest in the home of a dear friend... until you get the check (which, by the way, is an amazing value for the quality of the entire experience)!

Seated in the wine cellar, sharing copious amounts of wine and excellent pasta over candlelight, my wife leaned in...and stole the last ravioli off my plate.

Well, the romance may be dead in our relationship, but you seem like you still have a shot. So take your date to Convivium, and order the green apple and cinnamon ravioli with duck rag√∫. I know it sounds a bit odd, and it's ever so slightly sweet for my taste, but it works. So just do it.

If I have one warning for you:

I wouldn't get too attached to any of your choices on the wine list. We were literally sitting in a cellar full of wine, and yet they were out of the first three bottles we chose. Eventually we just said, ""Bring us the cheapest bottle of white wine that you actually have."" Because we're classy.

If I have two warnings for you:

Watch my wife around your ravioli. She's a thief.

If there was a 4.5 Star available, Convivium Osteria would get it. I loved it but there was something off for my meal. I felt like most dishes were missing that ""omg"" factor. All ingredients were fresh, meat was cooked amazingly but there was something from keeping me from the full 5 stars.

Just had a nice meal at Convivium. Still same great atmosphere. Still same great rustic food. But now the prices felt more reasonable (I think because rest of Park slope is getting so pricy). And now they take credit cards (beyond Amex). Woohoo!

Still recommend this place for a nice romantic meal. The food is spot on.
We had giant prawns cooked in salt, seafood salad, green apple ravioli with duck ragu - each one was flavorful, refreshing and perfectly executed.

Will be back

What can one say about Convivium Osteria - it is love on the plate. Probably the best romantic restaurant in park slope. Between rustic dishes with decadent sauces and seasonings, huge red wine selection (and great wine advice from sommelier), great romatic decor (dark wood tones, wooden tables, candle-light, copper pans on the walls) and attentive service - this is a great place for a date or romantic dinner.

Food is top notch. Most dishes are decadent and filling, so be ready to share. My favorites are - prawns cooked in salt (very flavorful and reasonable serving size), quail in red wine (sweet, gamy and fun), rack of lamb (soft, flavorful and well seasoned), rabbit (gamy with great taste of olives, capers and mediterranean ), and green apple ravioli with duck ragu (just decadent and great flavor combo). The wife prefers seafood - whole dorado or sea bass I've tasted off her plate were very good, but I still say that this cuisine shines when it comes to meats more than fish.
For a lighter fare, octopus salad is great and lighter still is the fresh greens (spinach? not sure, not an expert on salads) salad with goat cheese and nuts. Pasta dishes are also lighter fare compared to meats.
Can't comment on deserts as I'm stuffed everytime after an app and a main dish, and that says a lot as I can eat big time.

Not cheap. Not for children. But great experience each time. Make reservations as they fill up quickly and bring cash or AMEX as they don't take normal credit cards.

Delicious food and romantic, opulent decor.

I came here for the time during Restaurant Week 2019 and since then, I have been back a ton of times. I REALLY love Felice. This is the perfect date night spot! Everything from the lighting to the wood finishes give off an ""expensive"" vibe but their prices are actually very good for the area.

Their cocktails are anything but basic, and their pasta is always super fresh.

On my list of the best Italian spots in NYC!

The restaurant has two floors and is situated inside a hotel. The top floor was surrounded with bookcases. Overall service was good, the General Manager was knowledgeable and was helpful in narrowing our choices. In addition, we took advantage of wine pairing option which was $15 for NYC restaurant week brunch. Now to the meal:

Appetizer: We ordered the arancini. The arancini serving was made for sharing. I only ate three and I was already full. The appetizer was cooked to perfection in terms of authenticity. Therefore, definitely got my money's worth with this choice.

- Entree: We ordered the Chicken Milanese which was huge. The taste and texture of the chicken was on point. When combined with the cheese, tomatoes, arugula and balsamic vinaigrette it was one of the most perfect bite I have had in a long time. The dish was so huge I took it to go and had it for dinner. Definitely a dish worth getting.

Awesome food and portion size. Definite hidden gem. Can't wait to return for happy hour and will be returning for a private holiday party.

Totally delicious! I don't think there is a dish here that wouldn't be yummy. I was here with a group
And loved everything about it- from the lights to the bottles of wine to the seating! So cozy. But not too intimate. I was at a work dinner with my colleagues and it was very relaxing. I had a great salad with avocado and delicious heirloom tomatoes. My pasta dish (I never have pasta mind u) was out of this world- frutte de mare! So delicious paired with a yummy red wine. I love that it is attached to the Kimpton Hotel somif you want to play chess or take out a bicycle you can! This is such a special night out in my book! Waiters are very knowledgeable as well!

I was honestly surprised this place was so good! We couldn't find reservations anywhere on a Friday night at 8 pm last minute (hello outdoor dining) and live in FiDi. I called ahead and to my surprise they had a table for 5 available. Our table was ready for us when we got there, very clean and following all safety procedures. We ordered a bottle of wine for the table at the waiters selection and ordered some specials for the evening. The butternut squash risotto was fabulous! We will definitely be returning!

Hidden gem in the heart of Fidi! I've lived here for over two years and I'm disappointed in myself I've only discovered Felice this week, but thank goodness I finally did! It's situated in a perfect location easy to walk to no matter where in Fidi you live. It's also a 3 min walk from Fulton street station or 5 me walk from wall street station so super convenient.

What I love about this place is the dark lit atmosphere, service, and of course the food! It's the holidays so they had a fresh Christmas tree that smelled so yummy and beautiful lantern lights upon walking in. We made a same day reservation without issue and were seated near the bar area. The tables have this beautiful small lantern light so unique and perfectly set for the historic financial district. It was something so small, yet to perfect.

Let's get to the food. It's Italian fate with a great selection of imported beers on tap and by bottle along with a long list of wines. So for you all who like a unique drink here is the spot. Beware of the bread with their branded olive oil! It's addictive. For starters we went for the bruschetta Crostini (serving size  3) and the arancini balls, which to my delight might vegetarian friendly.  Our table got the soup of the day cauliflower and leek served in this cute wooden bowl and also a house salad which had some mozzarella balls and avocado in it. Bonus!

For Entrees the Branzino was the winner Served with a fennel salad and cooked to perfection. The skin was nice and crispy, but also not over cooked. Sometimes they undercook fish and it grosses me out, but the branzino was cooked and flavored perfectly. Close runner up cane the Fusilli al Ferretto  with tomato sauce, creamy burrata cheese, basil. When you order it the burrata is on top and you stir it in. Such a beautiful dish. We also tried the Ravioli della Casa which was the only dish we weren't a fan of. Too heavy handed on the spinach and it was a bit oily.. The Linguine di Mare was also good, but not amazing.

I did my usually food spying on other tables and the lasagna classico and Spaghetti Cacio e Pepe seemed to be people's choice. Looked amazing and I definitely want to go back to try.

To close the meal we got the classic Felice's Gelato Sundae. It's a great sharing desert and can definitely feed at least 4 people. It's served with these cute swirl cookies and homemade whipped cream!

Service was on point. Everyone from the front of the house to our server and bartender were beyond hospitable. They provided great recommendations and just overall nice energy. Overall great spot. Great for a dinner date with the candle light, great for a group, family, whatever!

I came here for dinner on Friday night, and it exceeded my expectations. The manager, Mina, made us feel right at home.

My boyfriend and I always order the meatballs and ricotta toast to start since both are delicious and easily shareable. For a main dish I always order the specials, so I got the cheese-stuffed pork chop. Oh my god it was incredible. Then for dessert we ordered the lemon chiffon cake and the hazelnut cake. Both were delicious.

They also have a great wine selection and very good cocktails. You can't go wrong.

The service was awesome too: our waiter Carlos was super attentive and very helpful with our menu choices.

My favorite restaurant in the city, I will obviously be back!

I love Felice and I've been here multiple times, for dinner as well as brunch since both are excellent.

The restaurant has a very romantic feel at night but bright and spacious enough for families during the day. There is a small bar off to the side in case you need to wait a bit for a table.

For brunch I love the French toast. And for dinner I almost always get their specials. The food is always super tasty, and I've never had a dish I didn't like. For a starter though, I recommend the ricotta tartine. If you love ricotta you will die it's so good.

The only reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five is for the inconsistent service. Most of the time I've gone here in the past the staff is very friendly and doesn't hesitate to make sure you are comfortable and happy with your food. Yesterday I came for Mother's Day brunch though, and our waitress was very short and inattentive. Hopefully it was a fluke thing though.

I decided to order a minestrone soup today for lunch . It was odd, usually minestrone is a tomato based broth. It was tasty though, a little too oily for my taste though. The bowl was $14, with a diet coke it came out to be $20. Also, the service was super slow. So if you're in a rush for lunch, this may not be your place

This place is amazing. I love how it looks inside the decor makes it cozy but trendy. The food was incredible. We ordered several meals and enjoyed every bit. The staff was very well trained and professional. Our waiter was also very thoughtful. It was our friends birthday and he picked up on it from the conversation so he brought a creen br√ªl√©e with a candle on it. Amazing service! I would highly recommend going here.

Came in tonight for restaurant week and it was really good!  The ambiance is pretty although very dark.  The service was good.  For our meals we started with the ricotta crostini and the arancini.  Both were delicious.  For my main meal I had the chicken Milanese.  It was a good version but not great.  The chicken could have been salted or seasoned.  I didn't really care for the choice of the wild arugula on top either.  It had a lot of stems.  My friends both had the cacio de Pepe and I tried it and it was really delicious.  For desert we all had gelatos we had vanilla pistachio and hazelnut.  The pistachio was my favorite.  I would definitely return

This place has a beautiful inside architecture and a classy and laid back ambiance.
I enjoyed the food and the service.
The rice balls appetizer is good.
The sauce for the Fusilli was a little too rich; it's served al dente (not boiled thoughly), but good overall.
The Felice sundae was good.

I plan on visiting again, hope the service is e
even more friendly and food even tastier.

I passed by Felice multiple times a week but discounted it since I assumed it was just an average hotel restaurant. I came here on the recommendation of a friend.

The restaurant is very large inside, very dimly lit, and accepts reservations. It's a great place to get together with a bunch of friends over good food, and a fun ambiance.

We ordered the meatballs appetizer - super delicious, super saucy, great taste and texture. We also ordered the Linguine di Mare. The linguini noodles were a good texture, and there was plenty of seafood to last the whole dish! I wish that the sauce were slightly stronger/more flavorful but altogether the dish was really good!

We also got the Fettucine alla Bolognese and this dish was SO good. Loved the red sauce, loved the veal, and the pasta really tied everything together. Would definitely come back for this Fettucine dish!

I love the location and its atmosphere. Romantic and cool at the same time. The selection of wine is brilliant. I tried one produced by their winery in Tuscany. The manager Flavio was really nice and his tip for the main course was excellent. As Italian,‚Äã I demand high quality when comes to this type of cuisine‚Äãe. Highly recommended‚Äã.

My frirnd takes me here for lunch. It's a very adorable little place. The decor is simple and pretty.
The food was great.
We had the mussel appetizer. It was soft, sweet and melt in your mouth.
Interested fettuccine alla bolognese was great. Perfect blend of meat sauce and pasta was definitely al dente.
My friend had pappardelle con salsissia - the sweet sausage was great as well.
If I had one complain would be the amount of time it took for dishes to arrive.
We ran out of time and will have to try dessert another time. But definitely will come back.

I had several holiday parties to attend and this one was in the Wall Street area. The restaurant is located in the ThompsonHotel. This is an Italian restaurant that has great ambiance that makes you feel as if you could be in Italy. The service was outstanding. We had a special pre-fix menu that contained food from the regular menu.

What I liked most was that you did not need to ask for anything, the wait staff was there at every turn to remove plates, refill the wine and water, etc. The hostess was bubbly and made sure that everyone was having a good time. The meal was served family style and we had ample food for the group of 14.

The appetizers we shared was the Arnancini- breaded saffron risotto balls, mozzarella and sun dried tomatoes. Caprese Salad, Artichoke Salad , beets, avocado, sliced almonds, parmigiana and basil dressing.

My entree was the salmon which was pan-seared with saut√©ed broccoli and sun-dried tomato pesto. There was also a choice of a sliced sirloin steak, Fettuccine Alla Bolognese, Fusilli with tomato sauce and creamy Burrata. For desert I had the chocolate gelato although there was a also a choice of Tiramisu and Pumpkin Cheesecake.

There menu offers a lot of choices and they have a nice wine selection. They offer a nice house wine although for red we chose bottles of 2016 Kith & Kin which was a Cabernet Sauvignon from the Napa Valley. The restaurant charged a fair price of $80. You can purchase the bottle retail for anywhere from $27 to $35. The wine was great and we went through a number of bottles. We really didn't drink the white and had 1 bottle of Meroi which was a 2016 Sauvignon from Italy. We paid $60 and you can purchase the white at retail for about $25.

This was a great experience, even though it is the hotel it was a comfortable, non-rushed experience. We spent about 4 hours there and the time just flew. I would recommend Felice for a great night out.

Felice Gold and a golden experience that was!
We came for dinner on Friday night and we loved everything about it . The food, the drinks, the atmosphere and the service were all fantastic . The manager Flavio was very attentive and took wonderful care of us. His food and wine suggestions were on point and left us with the desire to come back very soon.
We felt transported back in Italy and wished we had such an amazing restaurant in LA!
Felice what a gem you are ! Grazie

Location is very low key. I was not expecting such an intimate vibe, but was pleasantly surprised. In terms of food, I can only speak for the arancini and the fusilli with burrata dish which were both fine.

One small thing to keep in mind though is, if you're trying be healthy and substituting for whole wheat pasta, you'll get a whole wheat linguine and not the homemade fusilli-- the same probably goes for the other pasta dishes as well.

The food is excellent. The crostini was delicious with ""crushed burrata "".  They have their own brand of wine, they let you taste, it was excellent. We had a really great waitress. The hostess was accommodating since we forgot to make reservations.

Love this place. Got in to NY on a Sunday night about 8pm and checked into the Gild Hall hotel (which is very nice) and wanted to eat a good meal but didn't want to get over stuffed so late at night, and also didn't want to wander around lower Manhattan to find one.

Sat at the bar and had a 1/2 order of pasta and side of broccolini and it was the most perfect meal.  Great atmosphere and vibe.

Felice is the restaurant/bar at the Gild Hall Hotel in lower Manhattan.  After a full day out and about our family met up with friends who live in NYC at the bar while waiting for our reservation to eat in the restaurant.  Bartender and wait staff very accommodating and attentive.  Drinks were top shelf .   When we sat down to eat in the restaurant the waiter was very thorough and attentive.  The soup of the day was lentil soup which if I'm not mistaken was vegan which was even better.  Best lentil soup I've ever had in a Restaurant.  The portion is big enough for a meal in itself with a nice piece of bread!  For my main I ordered the Fettuccine alla Bolognese...which was very good!  Simple dish but very good!  This place was a perfect respite after a long day out in the city.  If you ever stay at The Gild Hall or are in the area I highly recommend this restaurant, 5 stars

Fantastic Italian spot if you're in the area. Wine selection is more than reasonable on choice and price. Staff is super friendly and the place has a great vibe. Got the gnocchi which were out of this world. They have a really nice room upstairs which I assume could be rented out for a private event. All in all would visit again, not much to be said about a place that did it all right.

For aesthetics alone, this place is 5 stars. You walk in and the walls are bookshelves with actual books on them and the walls are also lined with bottles of wine. Two of my favorite things in the world. The books are also removable, I may have fiddled with them because there is nothing I hate more than fake bookshelves. The wine was not removable. I came here for my company's Christmas party before the holidays and we had the entire top floor and private room to ourselves. It was really nicely set up. The bar had available a few wines and beers as well as open bar for us to imbibe in. I really enjoyed the red wine that was selected.

Our dinner was first served with two rounds of appetizers. Not going to lie, I was almost pretty much full after the appetizer round. Veal meatballs, baked eggplant in tomato sauce, arancini, burrata, some kind of deep fried chickpea fritter. Not sure if I'm forgetting anything but all solid. Really liked the chickpea thing and the eggplant and meatballs. The arancini was alright but could be cheesier. For the next course we were given the option of penne in a tomato sauce or ravioli with spinach and ricotta in a brown butter sage sauce. Regrets on not going with the ravioli because the penne was just fine. For the secondi we had the choice of salmon and chicken milanese. I went with the salmon and it was perfectly cooked but again, regrets on not going with the chicken because that was the largest slab of meat I've seen in a minute. I tried a bite and it was super flavorful. Salmon was also very tender and nice.

The shining star out of everything though was the desert. Everything was just a-okay tasting until I had the Tortino di Gianduia. Chocolate hazelnut cake surprise whatever. It tasted like I was eating a giant Ferrero Rocher ball. The gelato was also amazing tasting as I merrily ate away at my coworker's abandoned ice cream. I had a flight the next morning and couldn't move or breathe. Passed out like a fat baby. But will say, the shining points were the appetizers and desert for me.

This place was very beautiful, they have a very nice layout and the tables are great. The pasta was very delicious, but the Gnocchi sauce eventually became overpowering. Although I will say it was very well cooked. The service was okay, the waiter did forget to bring out one of the appetizers we ordered but we became full with the pastas so we didn't further mention it, but it would've been nice to try.

Solid American Italian restaurant with a nice bar area. Happy hour is only available at the bar. I didn't see upstairs but the downstairs felt a bit crammed even though we had a nice corner table. The bar area is really nice and had a extensive cocktail menu and wine list.

We started with a chicken liver crostini, which was the highlight for me but skip if you're not into mushy pates. We had 3 pasta dishes that were well seasoned and not as al dente as some other restaurants. I got the linguine with seafood, which had a good mix of fish, calamari, mussels and scallops. It was a rich tomato sauce. The pasta texture itself was ok, not as good as some of the homemade pasta places. Good rose choices on the drinks menu. Overall pretty solid.

Thank you Francisco, Emily and Luigi for the best night with my parents. I've been to the UES location but tonight's meal knocked my socks off. I came for Restaurant Week but discovered what's now one of my all time faves in NYC.

We had the arancini, mussels, calamari to start. The ingredients were so fresh and well executed. Listen people just come here for the calamari. It's a religious experience.

Last time I was so happy from a meal was Gramercy Tavern.

Sundays 25% entire wine bottles. We had a bottle Lambrusco that was divine.

We used to like this place.
But recent experience has been very disappointing. We ordered lasagna. First the dish came out was cold in the middle; so it was not freshly made. Instead of making a new one, they simply microwave it and give us back the same one. Lastly, they never apologize for it. It feels like it is our fault for ordering the cold lasagna.

The quality of both service and food is very bad.
Will never go there myself. And I don't recommend anyone to go there unless you want a cold lasagna.

Felice was absolutely amazing. We were able to walk in without a reservation on Saturday night and get a table for 4. The ambiance is wonderful, and the service was prompt and friendly. I had the best Caprese salad of my life (still thinking about it a day later). The two pastas I tried were also incredible (Carbonara and Gnocchi with mushrooms/truffle oil). My friends loved their meals as well. Highly recommend, cannot wait to go back the next time I am in NYC. Favorite meal of the entire trip, hands down.

First time come here on a Thursday not too busy which mean perfect time not waiting for too long but been waiting over 45min and the foods still not come out yet.
Service is good not too much to complain, serving water and appetizers while waiting for some tiny meatballs $16 and $25 for pasta that's enough for 1 person. Paying 50$ for some uncooked pasta took me 2min and I got out of the restaurant I can't stay here no more the seafood was just shell. This is so over price and I don't know who cook like this and took 45min wait horrible experience

My boyfriend introduced me to this restaurant. We had dinner twice here and it was a positive experience both times. During my first time here, we were lucky enough to dine here without a reservation since the place wasn't super busy. Another time, we didn't make a reservation and the wait was 45 minutes so we didn't bother waiting. For the second time dining here, I made sure to reserve a table and I did via OpenTable app.

The entrees that I have tried were:
1) Pappardelle con Salsiccia- Probably my favorite entree that I have tried so far. The entree comes with sweet Italian sausage, braised endive, mushrooms, herbs, and truffle oil. It was delicious and filling.
2) Ravioli della Casa- It's homemade ravioli with spinach and ricotta filling. The ravioli was pretty fresh and tasty. There were a couple of pieces of ravioli, but I didn't feel full after eating this entree. I guess I should have asked for more bread to help fill me up.

Overall, service was fine. The restaurant could be noisy at times tho. I also recommend making reservations just in case. This place is a good option for Italian food in the FiDi area.

I had the opportunity to go to Felice to grab a cup of coffee with a former Professor on a Friday afternoon. After living in the area for about four years I had never had the opportunity to experience Felice beforehand. I'm so astounded that I didn't because this spot is definitely A+. From the decor to the service, it was an all around great experience.

After arriving there around 5:30 PM I was instantly seated at a table within the bar section of the restaurant. There was only one other party of two there but I credited that to it being a rainy day, as well as that this spot is located in a hotel. By the time I left though the bar was packed and they had switched over to their evening services. I think you're good coming here at anytime and don't think there's a need to make a reservation in advance.

When it came to order I ended up having two cups of coffee, each around $3. They were quick to serve and also asked if I wanted a refill. I appreciated how attentive they were without being overbearing. This is definitely a good, quiet spot to catch up with a friend over coffee if you're in Fidi.

I definitely would recommend Felice to anyone looking for a guaranteed relaxing time! Their main restaurant looks great too! Hopefully I'll get a chance to write a review for that in the near future!

Solid wine and pasta spot in FiDi. The service was good and attentive. The pasta dishes were cooked al dente and the atmosphere is good for chatting because it's not too loud. The candlelight adds a nice touch and it seems like it would be a good date spot, I went with a friend and it was nice too. The place is more spacious than you'd think from the outside as it has a whole upstairs floor. The cocktails sounded nice too but we ended up sticking with reds. The wine menu was fairly extensive and divided by white, red, or rose then by geography.

As a FIDI resident, this review is long overdue.  Service is personalized & attentive.  Every dish I've tried tastes homemade & made to perfection.  I always feel at home when dining at Felice.  Thank you to the staff, & especially for the beautiful birthday acknowledgement.

Tucked away in Wall Street we dined late Saturday night and it was empty. Loved the intimacy and the entire staff. We weren't rushed and the food arrived as ordered in a timely fashion.

The rice balls were great.
Salmon was good.
Branzino was good. I would have liked a little more cauliflower.
Minestrone soup was very good.

I'd visit again if we were staying at the hotel. Loved the staff and would love to try a few different entrees next time to enjoy some of their homemade recipes.

My friends and I came in on a Sunday for brunch and had an awesome time! I had made a reservation for 11:30am but the restaurant was pretty empty when we got there so I think we would have been fine without it.

The restaurant is beautifully decorated and the service we received from our server as well as all the other staff was great! They bring out bread for the table to start, which is always a great touch. It was soft and warm and perfectly crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.

Their brunch entrees each come with a complimentary bellini or mimosa which is fantastic! One of my friends and I each ordered a different toast to split and share with each other because we both couldn't decide on one. We got the French toast and the avocado toast. Both were equally awesome! The avocado toast tasted fresh and came with 2 poached eggs on top as well as a nice salad on the side. The French toast is made with raisin brioche toast topped with strawberries, blueberries and powdered sugar. They also give you maple syrup on the side. It was a perfect meal of savory and sweet toasts.

In the end we couldn't resist their dessert menu and got a gelato sundae with cookie pieces, nuts, chocolate sauce, and dipped cream to share for the table. Amazing!

Overall a great experience, and prices were super reasonable for the food and drink you got. Definitely an awesome spot to grab brunch in fidi, I'll be back soon!

Good wine bar for downtown, I had better time at
The bar than the date. A bar had a separate than the restaurant. They have a whole bar and lounge area. Good spot downtown, a bit hidden due to construction but good atmosphere. Drink prices were 12-15$ a bit high to bad they had no specials for a Sunday evening. But would come back if needed a spot in the area.

Came here after a breakup once. The bartender (I want to say Abby or Addie, but I drank a lot that night) was the perfect mix of sympathetic and encouraging, but she gently watered me every so often and made sure I didn't overdo it. A beautiful red-headed angel. She gave some solid recommendations given that I wanted to drink but I'm picky af.  She started me off with a rum concoction that was pleasant at first but then tasted maybe gasoliney?, and then she made me something that tasted just like Jolly Ranchers. I drank it and I liked it, sorry not sorry.

She wasn't drunk but it felt so much like those one-night friendships drunk girls have at the club. Thank you, alcohol-bearing angel.

This has become a favorite bar lately, and the reasons for that are fivefold:

1. It happens to be located almost exactly halfway between me and a friend of mine, who also happens to have a moderate alcohol problem (in that we need it sometimes) and likes to meet up to solve it.

2. The fried pickles. Whether or not you'd like to refer to these as ""frickles,"" the ones at Hollow Nickel are nothing short of outstanding.

3. The rest of the food. They really fry everything well (like sweet potato fries), but it's all been pretty solid.

4. A solid happy hour, staffed by great bartenders. I'm not going to elaborate on this because it's self-explanatory.

5. The space is good, and the backyard is GREAT. So much more spacious and comfortable than you might imagine.

Cute bar but the food seems average.
On a Sunday night not too crowded. Came here for a friends birthday and it was just our group occupying the back of the place for a while which was nice. They have a really cool gas fire place on the back, adds to the cozyness. I like the layout of the tables also. Lots of big tables and booths and circle booths too.

Got the chicken fingers because the menu said hand battered. And I always love chicken fingers from scratch. But they over fried them. They were way to dark almost burnt. They gave 4 for $9. One was chewy and inedible so really 3. My friends liked their hotdog, fries and hamburger though. Maybe if I come here again I will try the hamburger. Wait staff and bar staff where nice too. But overall just an average spot, nothing standout.

I feel conflicted about the review because it really depends on what you're looking for. Came here for a quick, casual dinner - burgers and beer. And for that, this place delivers. They have a $15 burger + draft beer deal that is hard to beat. But...the burger's not great quality. The fries were solid, but honestly I think the burger was so greasy my stomach revolted.

The good: beer selection is fine, and the bartenders are really cool. Will probably come back for late night drinks, but skip the burger next time.

Great little bar with cute outdoor space. It has become our place while I worked in Brooklyn. We used to go there frequently (even though I now work in the Bronx I still make it out there once in a while). The tap list is small but decent. Drinks are good and strong. They have delicious sweet potato fries and wings and the chicken tenders are pretty good for a bar. Good happy hour specials. We love to take over one of the tables outside and just hang out for hours.

Came here for dinner one sunday night. Moderately busy, but we grabbed a spot at the bar.  Bartender was very friendly and helped us decide our drinks and meals. Beer selection is good miix off staples and some quality crafts. I went with the buffalo  chicken wrap, which was very good. Good crispy chicken with juicy white meat. My girlfriend got the burger, also well prepared. Overall a solid spot for sure.

Like this spot a lot for a relaxing hang in my neighborhood. In the winter there's a fire in the back and the backyard is delightful in the summer.
Really good beer and shot combos; beer and burger combo; beer and hot dog combo... you get the picture.
I would not call this a dive, it's far to clean for that, but it's also not stuffy, nor too self-conscious. Just a great neighborhood spot.

This was one of a handful of places near our hotel that was open late and still serving food. Bartenders were pretty friendly and accommodating and let us know we could sit anywhere but needed to come up to the bar to put in any drink or food orders. Fair enough.

Overall vibe... hipsterish. Cheap drinks, decently priced food, low lit, a bit of a grungy vibe to it, but I was diggin' it. Fellow patrons were pretty friendly as well as I recall a guy recommending a beer to me and said if I ordered it he'd get the next one on him. That was nice of him, but didn't take him up on the offer as I just was looking for a late night dinner and beer and planned to head out. Overall a decent sized bar with a good amount of folks on a late wednesday night watching the Lakers game. Kind of felt like I was back in LA for a bit (whoop whoop).

Anyways, for food I was quite impressed with the burger. Hard to say if it was actually as good as I remember or if I was just starving having flown in late and not eaten yet. But for $14 will get ya a burger and beer combo. Not much to it, just a special juicy blend, cooked to your liking and served with lettuce, tomato, and onion. They patty was perfectly cooked medium as I requested and definite a unique spice blend they use on it but delicious. Also shared an order of the chicken tenders which were uniquely battered with panko for extra crispiness and the honey mustard and bbq sauces tasted homemade and were great as well.

Glad we lucked out on this spot so late at night as it was just what we were looking for.

'Til next time, cheers!

Man I really don't know how I feel  about being that guy that gives every place 4stars but if you're every near BARCLAYS center and love a good dive bar with GREAT food please come here !!!

Highlight was leaving March Madness and continued watching Richmond (aka my 7th graders college class name) on the screen.

FOOD:

Wings are beyond phenomenal. Like had I known the were that good I would've deaded all the other orders and got 50wings. It's hard to describe what makes a good wing Bc so many components go into it. Ima keep it short: juicy and crisp at the same time.

JunkyardDog: I mean a hot dog with no nitrates is always the wave. I slacked not getting it bacon wrapped.

Quesadill: Top Notch - you can tell The ironed it on a plancha!

Burger & Beer Combo: My friend said it was cooked to perfection!!

AMBIANCE:

Delicious, no complaints.

The fried pickles are a must.
My BLT was delicious and came with a salad (which I'd usually skip, but the dressing was so good).
Boyfriend enjoyed his burger I might have stolen a bite.

Great food, nice bartender and server. Would come back here!

buffalo wrap was good. I like how they put the whole wrap on the flat top to heat it. It gives it a crunchy exterior. The breaded chicken is cooked well. I would say the flavor is pretty good. I though there were too many raw onions but that is just for my taste.

The bar area is cool with a little bit of a hipster feel to it.

There is a small kitchen so it is very cool that they can pump out decent food.  Cool place.

Always walk by this spot but decided to stop by and check out the place. Walked in to an attentive bartender by the name of Mark that made me feel welcomed. Wooded out interior. Booths to sit with friends as well as a backyard for sitting out under the sun. Sat at the bar & ordered a burger and fries and man it was juicy & I couldn't even eat it all. Had a Carlsberg and even chatted with the neighbors who are regulars. Cool spot. I'll stop by again.

If I'm heading toward Barclays area for whatever reason I like to pop into Hollow Nickel. Great happy hour deals, and even better beer and shot for $6 all day. The back is nice and chill to hang with friends in the warm weather days. Also, the food is surprisingly good! The chicken fingers are my favorite, super crispy and large, almost like schnitzel fingers if I were to rename them. The fried pickles equally crispy and well seasoned. My buddy said the burger was really good, came with a beer for $15 if I recall.

You won't feel hollow coming here, and you won't have to spend too many of your hard earned nickels to have a good time. Oooof, ok, cheesemiestro out.

This is awesome place to get a drink and meet local people.  The vibe is very chill and most people are open and friendly. The service is great. My usually bartender ( Anna) when I'm visiting from California is super sweet and friendly. If you are in the area , this is one of the places you should visit. I'm definitely a return patron and I live in another state!!

This is a great little dive bar. I loved the pickle backs. Perfect bourbon pairing and pickle juice had spice to it. Had burgers and fries pickles with colleague. Food was good. Unremarkable but not disappointing.  Great vibe. Inexpensive. I'll definitely return. Kinda average for Brooklyn but exactly what was needed.

Came in on a Sunday afternoon walking through the neighborhood. Small, quaint, friendly bartender who was beyond helpful. Great drink deals! Even better burgers though! I was not expecting such a great tasting patty. Wings were awesome too, had the Korean bbq flavored and you get a lot for the price. Clean bathroom. Will for sure go back.

I wish I could rate this place but my wife and I walked out in 5 minutes.  This place is a DIVE!!!!!
And not in a good way!!!

Okay, we walked in at 6:30 on a Saturday evening. There were 2 bartenders, and the place was reasonable crowded.  Did not see a hostess/host, waiter/ waitress to seat us, so we just sat down, no big deal.

We sat at a little bar stool, and did not see any servers.  I walked up to the bar, and looked into the kitchen, and saw wrap on the counter just sitting there with lettuce and tomatoes.  The cook was walking around the bar, and looked like he wasn't focused on food. The 2 bartenders were busy, but were too cool for school, and were focused on serving.

I looked back at my wife sitting at the table, and what looked like a homeless women was sitting in my seat with a doll talking to my wife. She asked my wife if she like her baby!  I went back to my wife and said let's go, and the women said to me, ""I am talking to her!""

I don't know who owns this place but they should read this...
1. Absent Service on a busy Saturday night
2. A disgusting looking kitchen, and a cook who definitely was not interested in what he was doing
3. Homeless/ mentally ill people allowed to walk around the bar, and harass customers.  I don't think this is good for business in my opinion.

I went to this place because the ratings were really good.   I'm sure the people who rated this place were sincere.  What the hell happened?  Maybe the owner of this place doesn't give a f**k anymore, and wants to let it go.

Alright happy hour spot close to Barclays Center. $5 well drinks, $6 margaritas and wine and beer specials 4-7. First vodka club was on the bartender which was super kind. Also tried the ""Rosemary's Baby"" gin cocktail which was not on HH and a little sweet for my taste. Ordered a Hollow Nickel salad with mesclun, goat cheese, candied walnuts and dried cranberries. Pretty good and a satisfying portion. Tried some guacamole and wasn't crazy about it. Chips were VERY salty.

Overall a solid choice for HH or a casual drink on Atlantic Ave. Would return.

Came in to get out of the heat and get some brunch while my daughter was at an event at the roulette across the street . Air was cranking, bartender friendly, atmosphere comfortable. Got the breakfast burrito w fries for $13. Fries kinda raw but burrito was awesome. Would return.

This place was great! I stopped here before a show at Barclays.

The setting is pretty intimate - I wish I lived closer to this place.

I had the BLT and the fried pickles. Both were really good - I would definitely order them again!

Next time I'm at Barclays I'll definitely stop by this place.

Didnt try any food but it looks decent.  Scored the last solo bar atool at the full but not overly crowded bar on a Tue at 6pm.  I like the simple menu. $4 buds, 5 corona, 6 stella and heiny and 7 for guiness.  9 and up for wine. Simple system, simple crowd.  Gonna try ot on a weekend brunch.

Came here for brunch with high hopes, but they got shot down faster than a runaway squirrel.

The veggie burger was unappetizing and bland in flavor. So I deconstructed it to the bun and egg, which were palatable on their own.

The service was inattentive to the point that I had to walk up to the counter and demand my check after 15 minutes of finishing what I could on my plate.

However, the remeding qualities of my experience were the side salad and my friend's burger, which were adeqaute. All in all, not really a spot for a vegetarian like me.

Great place to grab a drink and some bar food.  It gets pretty full at random times but I've never had a problem getting a seat/service. They have good happy hour deals and shot deals (beer and a shot, pickleback shot deal, etc.) and a great selection of whiskey.  The bar food here is pretty satisfying, and I sometimes find myself craving the chicken fingers.  If it's a warm day, you should definitely check out the backyard!

We happened to be driving down Atlantic ave one night and we saw this local bar. It looked nice kind of like a comfy sports bar from the outside so we pulled over & went in for a beer.
It's a nice space and I can see myself having a good time here, however when we were there, there was a really loud hipster chic loudly discussing some music album with the bartender. Energy here was a bit bougie and hipsterish. We drank 1/4 of our beers and just left..
Beer selection was really small. (Also they don't carry Heineken) and the draft picks we got sucked.. menu didn't seem so appealing either..
Maybe we'll be back to give it another try in the summer since they have an outdoor area.

This bar is amazing! Bartender Jamie is super friendly and happy. WAY better than the salty experience we had down the street at Robert Bar.

But seriously Jamie is super amazing and should be here every night. SUCH a great face for this business.

This is a review for food only! In short, food took too long to come out (almost 40 minutes for 3 plates) and food did not taste good.

Came here right after a Nets game to grab a quick bite. But little did we know our quick bite was gonna last over an hour. Got here around 1015pm with 2 other ppl. We ordered quickly at the bar, 2 (cooked medium) burgers with fries, and a shepherds pie.

Then we waited, and waited and waited. 30 minutes in, we asked the bartender where our food was, and he's like it's coming out. 10 minutes later (past 11pm already!) the 2 burgers come out and they were definitely NOT cooked medium. Both burgers were too done, and the outside of the meat was all burnt. It was so dry and we were not happy with the burgers, but we were hungry and it was getting late, so we ate it anyway. Fries were overly salty.

My shepherd's pie came several minutes after the burgers. I've never really ordered shepherd's pie before so I don't really have anything to compare it to, but it was not good. Basically it was mashed potatoes with ground up slurry of meat. The taste was just alright.

Fyi, think there was only 1 cook in the kitchen so that's probably why it took so long, but nonetheless, I'm still giving it a 1 star review cuz I had a 1 star experience regardless of the conditions.

Highly recommend.
With short notice to bartender Jean and the excellent kitchen staff, 13 thirsty, hungry people descended on the Hollow Nickel after a fabulous visit to the nearby Transit Museum. We received terrific service from this ""order food at the bar"" establishment. Met some other wonderful patrons who had also been to the Transit Museum that day. First timers to both the Museum and the Hollow Nickel, we all had a great time.
The menu is nicely varied pub food. A breakfast burger and fried pickles were our more adventurous choices. Lots of great burgers cooked to order, chicken wings, tomato soup and grilled cheese for the young at heart. The beer choices on draft were great. Loved my IPA.
Wish this place were closer to home. I'd be there every weekend.
Close to the Barclay Center if you're in for an event.  Has an outdoor back patio which looked nice though a little too chilly outside today for any of my group.

Hollow Nickel has two things that make a great bar - a good whiskey selection, and an amazing backyard. I've passed by this place many times while walking home and never really stopped in. But I had some time to kill and decided to take the plunge.

They have a very respectable whiskey/bourbon/Scotch selection, all for very reasonable prices. Laphroaig was $12 and Blanton's was $13. I've definitely paid more for both.

The backyard is pretty huge. It's nicer than 4th Ave Pub and is a lot more open. Great place to be during the spring or summer months.

Sad that it took so long to get my ass over here, but I'll definitely be returning!

It took me way too long to try this place.  Small but lots character.  Tap selection is solid and having Blue Point Toasted Lagers at $5 (and not just at happy hour) makes me excited.   Other beers are $7 and at this point I will take that price since beer prices seem to be creeping up in BK lately.  I recently saw a Bells Two Hearted for $9 at a bar in Greenpoint .  Bartender acknowledge us right away when we walked in and even said goodbye to us as we were leaving.  Maybe I am old school but I miss that at bars lately when the bartenders act too pretentious.  We didn't order food, but I would come back and try for sure.  One tv in the corner is perfect for your sports game fix.

I came here with a group of eight people before a concert down at the Barclays Center.  We made it in time for happy hour and were able to find seating out back under the string lights at a longer picnic table.  I would recommend this place for a happy hour or their $12 burger and a beer special.

A lucky find for a pre-concert pregame.

Unpretentious, low key bar right on Atlantic Ave.

Love the tin ceiling, booth seats and shelves with real books (yes, real!). There is also room on the back with more seatings and backyard, but it was reserved the night we were there, so I could not check it out.

They have TV for all you sport fans!

Good beer selection. Food is simple, but pretty great. Fries were good, and BLT was very, very nicely put together - perfectly toasted bread, thick-cut bacon, fresh tomatoes - delish!!!

Now, someone please, please tell me the meaning of abbreviation on the mirror??? I will love you forever if you do!

Stumbled into Hollow Nickel on a rainy Sunday when we were in need of shelter from the rain.

Food is about three stars, but the service pushes Hollow Nickel to four stars.

The ordering (at least on a Sunday) is DIY, but we didn't mind with Abbey's friendly demeanor. :)

Protips:
$6 Pickle back shots
$7 beers on tap

Good rock and roll tunes as well.

Thanks for the great service, Abbey. We enjoyed staying dry with you!

It was a pretty good vibe. I like the decor. I had a chicken sandwich, my boyfriend had the burger. He wanted a second burger. My only criticism would be more seasoning on the fried chicken and a nice sauce would take that sandwich beyond anyone's expectations. Also we didn't like that the bartender kept going out for smoke breaks.

Came here to check out a bar with food. Cool little spot with decent drink deals. I stuck with the shot and a beer (Narraganset & Evan Williams for $6). We tried the nachos which boasted homemade chips. I don't know if they were homemade but, they're delicious. Someone else complained theirs were cold. Ours were warm but, could of used more time to melt all the cheese. Their salsa also tasted like there was pickle juice in it, not into that. Also had the tenders which were very crispy and were great. Affordable prices and so far everything g was good. Good amount of seating in the back, still small place though. Staff was very pleasant as well.

My friend found this place on Yelp and decided to have happy hour/dinner here on a Friday evening around 6pm. Judging from the reviews and pictures, we decided to give this place a try.

Once we stepped in, it was CROWDED. The only available seats we saw were by the window and seated ourselves. There were shot glasses and glass cups everywhere. No one came around to cleaning them so we just pushed them aside. There was a huge blackboard with a mini menu and also a small paper menu floating around from table to table.

Went to the bar and ordered the turkey toastie for myself & the angus burger for my friend and drinks. Asked for a malibu bay breeze and blue hawaiian and the bartender that helped me said they don't carry malibu and I just settled for a cider. Waited on the blue hawaiian for a bit and she never came back with it. When I finally got her attention again, I asked her where was the blue hawaiian and her response was 'what's in that again?' I'm sorry, but how are you a bartender and not know what's in a blue hawaiian? When I told her she said they didn't carry blue curacao.

Whoever she was, she must be new. I wish I got her name because she was clueless throughout the whole time I was there. I had to repeat my order to her twice and the order number twice. I told her I wanted the burger medium and it came out well done. The turkey toastie was your typical turkey sandwich drenched in butter. The fries that came with it were super salty. When we were finish, I went to close my tab and it took forever to get her attention. She looked over at me a couple of times and totally ignored me when I tried to wave her down and she decided to help others instead. Super annoyed, I just waved down another worker to close the tab for me.

Overall, the worst experienced ever. The food was mediocre, the service was terrible, the selection was limited and it was disgusting inside. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this place. You'll probably have a better experience at Applebee's inside Atlantic Terminal.

Sonambula is a great spicy margarita, for those whose enjoy the spicy kick
Mimos Corazon is a perfect twist of a mimosa

I absolutely loved the steak and eggs , just wow! Their chimichurri sauce hands down is one of the best I've had , perfect flavor !

The churros we all shared for dessert and those were amazing !!!!!

Leyenda has nailed it every time I go there, and they didn't let down during covid cdc regulations.
It is a good place for sharing tapas and fun cocktails. Since its connected to the Clover Club it is no surprise they have creative, refined, interesting drinks that taste smooth and often come in decorative glassware.
I have enjoyed the shrimp arepas, they are some of the lightest ones I have had.
The chips and guac were good but the guacamole is only enough to fill a half avocado which it is served in.
This time we got the pupusas which felt night and light since they are vegetarian, good for sharing.
I really thought the al pastor tacos were tasty especially once the lime and cilantro are added.
The Brookyn Burro drink was so light and refreshing! I ordered a second and they forgot about it but we had already finished our meal and they had a one hour seating limit anyway and they didn't accidentally charge us either.
Service was friendlier than ever, and it was helpful that they specifically described the behavior required and why they made certain accommodations. They explained they were only giving 1 menu per table to save paper since they dispose of them. The menu explained how they sanitized the tables after each party left and they would like people to wear the mask when a server came to the table since they interacted with so many people in a given day.
They still have their backyard but it is more spread out and they added street seating.
I would come back again soon!

There is plenty of outdoor seating out in the front and also in the garden. We sat at a high table for three in the front. We loved the food! The shrimp arepas is a must order! It is so delicious, crunchy and flavorful. Would love to order 2 just for myself! For the table we shared family style, chips and guac, chicken tacos, skirt steak (DELICIOUS MUST ORDER!!) and seafood ceviche. The seafood ceviche was different with pomegranate and not your conventional way but we liked the twist and thought it tasted great!

The cocktails are fun, I order a frozen cocktail that was lit on fire. Loved the presentation, smooth fruity cocktail was so good. It reminded me of a pina colada with mango pur√©e. My friends also got several rounds of other cocktails that are all worth a try!

Service seemed a bit off that evening. Super lagging (from what we saw it was not busy) but we had each other's company and didn't mind the wait. After all the drinks and food made up for it. Would like to come back!

What a disappointment. We stopped by here because it was packed with people, but this place fell flat and I should've paid more attention to the clientele.

The host is really nice and attentive, but the waitress was ehhhh. First off, you have to wear a mask every time the server comes to the table. Keep that in mind if you plan I'm ordering an app and entree, plus drinks.

It took nearly 10 minutes for our waitress to come over to take our drinks and app down. They came at a decent rate, but we sat for like 20+ minutes and she never returned to take our entree order. We tried to flag her down but it seemed like she avoided eye contact. All we had was a frozen margarita and chips and guacamole.

Portions are small, in my opinion. But, the drinks were good. Overall, it felt weird being there (as the only non-white person) but what was even weirder was how quick they were to get our check and take it back when we finally caught the host's attention.

You're probably better off eating a few doors down at Purapecha. More diverse clientele (which is more trusting), better prices, better service, and though we didn't try food at Leyenda I'm sure the food is also better.

I randomly stopped by the other evening for a drink, and wow was I impressed. The Headless Horseman cocktail - which is both frozen and on fire - is one of the most delicious drinks I've ever had. I will definitely be returning here.

Leyenda definitely fell short of our expectations. The staff was friendly but the menu definitely needs some revamping. If you want variety, this may not be the place for you. My friend tried to order the steak and guess what? It comes by itself and no sides are available! There aren't any sides on the menu at all. We ended up getting guac and chip and croquettes as appetizers and then going to a near by restaurant for actual food. The croquettes were ok--the guacamole was way better. I'd never come back here for dinner, maybe just for drinks and an appetizer. Also, if you go during the summer, bring bug spray. We got eaten up :(

Disappointed. Staff was inattentive. Bacalao was soggy, ceviche was more veggie than fish, croquettes not the same as before. With limited social activity and multiple small businesses to support, we probably won't make the effort to find the time to come again. Bummed, it was close to home and one of our favorite spots pre2020.

Been coming here for years. Love the outdoor patio in the summer. The food is delicious.
I never noticed they carried one of my favorite rhums-Clarin.
The service is always great.

Leyenda was nice! I went right before Christmas for my friends birthday. The atmosphere was really festive and they had a great ambiance. It was decorated very for the holiday season and the cocktails were also on theme which was cool.

With that being said, this place is 100%  a bar vibe with tapas food. The food was good but I would recommend not going here if your very famished because you won't be full from one meal and the food is a bit pricey for the quantity you get. It's a nice for a group chatting but there is no formal table seating.

Additionally, our waiter was not friendly at all and really made us feel uncomfortable ordering most of the night. Not sure if she was having a rough day or what the case was but she definitely shouldn't be waitressing if she wasn't going to be pleasant. It really made the vibe negative and made us reluctant to make orders.

Came here for birthday brunch and sat outside. Great service & great food!

I got:

steak & eggs- so delicious, the meat was so tender and juicy.

Churros- also delicious

Leyenda bloody- a carrot juice base (I think) ""Bloody Mary."" With the the option to choose your liquor. It was spectacular!

Mezcal- on point

We have came to Leyenda before. We got the idea from visiting Clover Club their sister lounge/restaurant across the street. The cocktails and food are delicious there and we wanted a simpler experience.  Leyenda is a Mexican inspired tapas/cocktail bar.

Our first experience we came early got a seat at high top table and it was somewhat pleasant. The food and cocktails were okay and was willing to try it again and here we are.

We entered the establishment and no one was there to greet us. It was little later then last time but We did see some empty tables and was happy about that. There wasn't many people standing around so we thought we would be lucky.  A host came rushing over when we were going over to a table and asked if we would like to sit. We said yes and he said 45 mins. It was weird because there was just so many empty tables plus we heard they have a outdoor area.  We put our name down and saw seats at the bar and sat.  We figured if we can sit at the bar and eat why sit at a table. We ordered drinks and food and there was three tables that were empty for a good 30 mins. Really upsetting we couldn't have been accommodated.

We order a some mixed drinks from the menu a Tia Mia and a bourbon type drink. Both were okay. They were fruity and thoughtfully prepared by our bartender.

We ordered for dinner: shrimp arepas, ropa veijas, pernil with mofongo, and enchiladas with mole negro.
The arepas we ordered we never received.  We got something else in its place. It tasted okay. It was warm not hot.
The ropa veija was tasty it was over plantains. We enjoyed this dish.
The mofongo was tasty and pernil was good. We had ordered this the last time and it was our least fav dish. This time we really enjoyed it.
The chicken enchiladas was cold! Like ice cold! And flavorless. I wouldn't get this..

It's crazy how delicious Clover Clubs food and cocktails are and how mediocre Leyenda food and cocktails are. Unfortunately, I would say this is prob our last visit here. The only thing going is the vibe. It's really a shame..

Parking is somewhat easy(352)

This was the first of 3 stops for the Friday night happy hour tour with the throuple. The decor was very well done for with a Hawaii/Halloween theme decorations and drinks. My favorite part was the fact they had both table and lounge style areas

We had 3 different tequila based drinks - poloma, margarita and a spicy margarita - and all 3 were great. The trick is to have a strong kick of alcohol but with the flavor to not make it taste like burning. They hit it on the nose.

For snacks we git the Chicharon and guac. The chicharon was not what I expected, having a Colombian sister in law and a Filipino girlfriend. It was basically pork rinds. The guac was great however and came with salsa as well.

This place was once amazing. Now it's mediocre at best. The host and wait staff somewhat robotic. They have now went the route of putting some of their signature cocktails on draft! VERY LAZY MOVE. CANT CHARGE $14 for draft cocktails. I would literally commute 1hr just to grab one of their delicious Spicy Palomas now that's on draft. It taste like a cheap flavored soda. RIP Leyenda.

What a great place!! The hubs and I decided to come  here after catching a show at The
Bell  House, it was one of the few eateries open late on a Wednesday, the decor is lovely and authentic without being tacky or overdone. The food was very good, I had the pupusas, and the hubs had the Peruvian Salad, and two negro modelos, which they had on draft !
The guacamole was fresh and flavorful as well.
My only disappointment was how tiny the pupusas were!!
Guess next time I'll get two orders...
The service was superb, attentive, courteous and professional.

Had a great time here! The drinks were delicious and so was the food. Currently celebrating Christmas so there are lots of decorations and Christmas themed drinks. Our bartender was super attentive and always made sure we were doing ok. They do get very crowded the later it gets so be prepared for a crowded bar and dining room. Will definitely be back during the warmer months!

Leyenda was on my bucket list to go to in Bk and it met my expectations.  The croquetas were delicious as was the bacalao and al pastor tacos.  The cocktails were amazing as well. Was happy to see a Bourbon drink included in the rotation.  Great service overall. Would highly recommend.

This is definitely one of my favorite cocktails bars in Brooklyn. The chiller instinct is one of the smoothest bourbon drinks I've ever had & the frozen horchata drink they offer in the summer is like candy.

With that being said, they tend to mix up the drinks by the season, but almost every cocktail that I've tried here, I've enjoyed. Drinks run in the standard range for cocktail bar $13-$15. The vibe is also inviting and warm here.

I would have to dock a star for food, however. They have some small plates, including tacos that were all flavorful, but pale in comparison to the drinks.

I went to have a nice relaxing time with friends after a long week. Immediately as you walk in there is a big sign with a drawing of Trump and above it it says ""Donald Trump es un pendejo""...This is right in your face as you walk in. I found it offensive and strange that this restaurant would choose to have this huge and crude political statement greet customers as they walk in. Of course it is their right to do so, and they can do it if they want to, but I think that type of in your face political stuff is annoying, for either side.

5 stars for cocktails
Food is probably overpriced with very small portions, was still hungry after paying $50/pp...
Service was pretty slow but friendly
Otherwise cool atmosphere.
Recommend reserving spot on waitlist on yelp so you can walk in when there's a seat for you

My friends and I went to Leyenda for their Christmas pop op theme two Sundays ago and enjoyed the lunch a lot. They call it ""Sleyenda"" and it's cute because they decorate and create holiday themed cocktails. I had the Six Geese a Layin and Coconut Horchata Cold Bree with booze and both were good. We had the guacamole and it was quite good and we enjoyed the salsa but when they asked us if we wanted more chips and salsa, we said yes because why wouldn't we?! And then we were charged $2.50 for more salsa and chips. That's a little deceiving and honestly, really not cool in my opinion. The chicken mol√® enchiladas were very good though, so I can appreciate that. I also mentioned to the server that I would want to finish my meal with the coquito go ho drink and then when I was finished with my meal and went to order it, it was gone. Really? I mean, I get it. If people order something you give it to them but a heads up about the drink being closed to being 86d for the day would have been awesome. Unfortunately, after a beer next door afterwards, we were still hungry so went elsewhere.

Great food but beware masks are required at the table when staff come over. Yes it's a tough time but the host/ waiter was extreme when it came to insisting on us putting our masks on every time he came over. Do not bring a first date here. Very awkward. It was stressful especially facing the wall, hoping I'd be prepared for when he showed up. He left the pitcher of water on the bench near us when we weren't masked up. I'm not ignorant to Covid but this was over the top. So overall good food and good atmosphere but I think it's important to be aware that the mask on mask off requirement is very much enforced.

I feel like I've come to this restaurant through 3 or 4 name (possibly owner) changes and right now it's the best I've ever experienced. The food is simply amazing. I'm very impressed with the quality of ingredients and  how well everything is prepared. Their drink options are also top notch. I went there a little before Christmas, and they nailed the holiday  theme. From the decorations to the spirited cocktails (no pun intended) it was an awesome experience. Will be coming back for sure.

One of my favorite Brooklyn bars, located in Cobble Hill, Leyenda has an extensive cocktail menu ranging from strong spirit forward to fruity tiki drinks!

It can get packed during the weekend nights but it's never uncomfortably crowded inside. They have an extensive variety of mezcal lining the wall behind the bar and great options for a light dinner.

My favorites here:
1) Shotgun Wedding, if you're looking for a strong sweet and creamy drink!
2) Potato, Cheese and Chorizo Flautas, need I say anymore? Good to be shared if you want to get multiple dishes!
3) Fish Tacos, I've had bad fish tacos before and let me just say this is far from bad! So good!

Leyenda, a sister bar to Clover Club, delivers on all fronts. Super down-to-earth bartenders. Great happy hour.

Ambiance is sort of Mexican saloon-like? Sort of worn, chipping wood, big wooden booths, almost picnic table-y. Oh, and there is a backyard.

The Paloma cocktail I had was very balanced and affordable (see happy hour above). I only had a quick drink when waiting for a friend, so I can't say much more. But I wish I could. Next time I'm in the neighborhood, this will be top of mind.

Note: this review is more for the drinks than the food, although I have had the chance to sample some items from the menu.

All in all a cool, higher-end Mexican and tequila spot close to the Bergen stop with an awesome selection of cocktails with unexpected ingredients, a variety of tequila flights, and some pretty unbeatable happy hour deals (M-F, 5-7pm and 11pm-1am).

During happy hour, you can choose between $4 estrellas, $5 wine, $5 micheladas, or some select $8 cocktails. The happy hour cocktails aren't the most exotic, but you get what you pay for. I've gotten the michelada a few times and wasn't blown away - I like mine a lot spicier usually (just because you're a fancy place doesn't mean you can get away without tajin!) but it's still tasty and refreshing. It's made with a papaya and carrot sangrita and adorned with a lime scored with diagonal lines and a metal straw. It's all in the details.

The cocktail menu is super cool - my favorite drink is the Horchata Colada ($13) which is a delicious, and I'm sure extremely caloric, frozen beverage with overproof rum, nutmeg, etc. It's served in the coolest skull mug. I recently tried the Life of Pablo ($13) with poblano-infused mezcal, pineapple rum, manzanilla sherry, dolin blanc, and Suze. While I was unimpressed by the drink itself, the presentation was something straight out of Achatz's The Aviary. The bartender had to run back to the garden to pick the garnish for my drink. The Daiquiri Al Pastor ($14) with pork fat-washed white rum, pineapple, achiote, agave, and lime was a disappointment.

All in all, pretty remarkable cocktail menu + great happy hour deals = I'll absolutely go back. Why just 4 stars, then? The few times that my boyfriend and I have gone and tried to sit out back, the service was just abysmal. There was a time we were seated, waited 45 minutes for someone to come over, and then eventually just gave up. Lesson learned; I just know to sit at the bar where I'm firmly planted in front of the bartenders.

Came here on a Saturday night after seeing that this place was highly rated. Boy did I make a big mistake. My girlfriend and I ordered the panuchos and the tequila flakes shrimp arepa. I was super hungry so I was thinking about ordering more but I'm glad I didn't. When the food came we were shocked to see how small the portion size was. It was literally a two-three bite meal. For over $30 between the two of us that was a bit much. We ended up going to pig beach to get more food since we left unsatisfied. I'm not sure if people come here for the drinks or what not but the food is average and overpriced. Definitely will not come back.

Came here for ""Cinco de Derby"" as they put it because they're awesome and understand how unfair it is to have to choose between celebrating Cinco de Mayo or Kentucky Derby. Leyenda's all like, why not both?

They had 3 varieties of margarita and 1 julep on their special menu for the night. I stuck to the classic margarita and wow, it was excellent. Actually, maybe even perfect! They used a very fine grain salt to salt the rim which made it that much better. It was so good I had to have a second. I didn't get the chance to try their julep, but that's just my excuse to come back.

On top of amazing drinks, Leyenda has an insane food menu full of Latin American deliciousness: pupusas, flautas, empanadas, enchiladas, etc. All the good stuff. We had the patacones con ropa vieja, which is a fried green plantain topped with shredded beef, crema, and queso fresco. It was my first time trying it and it was to die for! My friend and I were fighting over the last bites.

Can't wait to come back!

A mixologist's dream

The extensive cocktail menu is one of Leyenda's claim to fame. I'm pretty simplistic when it come to my adult beverages (I do not need more than three ingredients in my drinks), but folks who are really in to crafty multi-layered adult beverages will enjoy this spot. Since most of the specialty cocktails have at least 5+ ingredients, it may take some time to receive your drinks if you are in a larger group or if the restaurant is busy. Fortunately for us, we came on a relatively slow night.

For food, I went the papusas. Although they were not mind blowing, as they are in some  places in deep in Queens, they did hit the spot.

The bartenders (um mixologists) are very relatable and chill; I chatted with a couple of them and a manager for a few minutes.

They have great drinks here. The Brooklyn burro was my favorite! It is more of a bar vibe so the plates are smaller. The guacamole is very good, the al pastor and pollo tacos were great as well. My favorite dish was probably the pernil, though. It was so tender and flavorful! I think Leyenda is great for a casual date night.

Participating in an archery class really works up an appetite and boy did I find that out-lol. Before leaving Gotham Archery the other weekend, we felt hunger setting in....Deciding where to go took us several minutes. Kemi whipped out her phone and searched on Yelp for nearby eateries. We called Leyenda and they indicated that there currently was a table for party of 4. We walked there and the hostess seated us upon arrival. Leyenda had great energy with people socializing and having fun! You know that this kind of place has my name written all over it-lol.

Leyenda is a Latin-American establishment that has a bar, cozy style table settings w/ stool type seating and a semi-private lounge area called ""The Pews"" located in the back where groups can hang out and enjoy themselves. I walked back there to get an idea and it is cozy.

Many patrons seemed to be having cocktails. There was a couple at the bar and they had these beautiful drinks. The bartender politely informed me that they had the Tia Mia Cocktail. Well, I tried one of of course-lol. The Tia Mia has Mezcal espadin, Jamaican Rum, Orange Curcao, Lime and Orgeat. Beautiful presentation and it tasted nice and strong!

We opened our menus and started ordering. Leyenda serves small plates so we tried a variety of items. Rich and creamy Guacamole was delightful w/ the chips. Good Skirt Steak. Flavorful Tinga de Puerco (pulled pork) and Pollo (chicken) Tacos....Such juicy, succulent meat in the tacos! Fantastic!

Leyenda's staff are so warm and welcoming! Thanks!

Glad I finally got to try this place out. I had wanted to check it out when it was Sleyenda for the Xmas season but never got around to it. This place is the epitome of what I thought a NYC restaurant/bar would look like before moving here. Dimly lit, great music, brick wall accents, laid back crowd. Their drink menu has some really interesting concoctions. I had a margarita and the trade winds - both of which were delicious. To start we got the chips and guac which were delicious and the guac was amazing and smooth - served right in the avocado shell. For my meal I got the skirt steak which was one of the most juicy, tender and flavorful skirt steaks Ive ever had. It literally melted in my mouth like butter and was cooked perfectly medium rare. My only complaint was that it was kind of small and came with no side. The service was great - from the host to our waitress. 4 stars for the kind of small pricey drinks and small food portions...I left still hungry lol but I will definitely be back!

Came here for dinner last night and it was fantastic - the service here is impeccable, they're all very attentive and took our orders down quickly. I highly recommend La Sonambula if you love a spicy cocktail, it was the perfect amount of spice, sweetness and sourness in a drink. The skirt steak here i'd phenomenal, it's often hard to find a place that will cook skirt steak medium perfectly but they nailed it. I will definitely be coming back.

Stopped by last month for ""Sleyenda"" which was touted as a Beyonce themed pop up for the holidays. Besides the menu card which had a picture of Santa that said ""I sleigh"" there wasn't one nod to the Queen Bey in the place...not even a Destiny's Child song from the Christmas album included in the soundtrack. Perhaps the theme was over hyped online, but I felt a bit fooled by the advertising.

Regardless of the deceptive theme, I'd give three stars for the overall experience. It's a great little spot tucked away on a busy street. While some of the spots in the areas have lines for days to squeeze into brunch, there are plenty of tables and room to move around inside.

The cocktails are great. I had one of the holiday specials. You can tell there was time and effort put into creating these drinks and it pays off. The food on the other hand is just average. The guacamole and chips are quiet nice and the guac is served in the avocado - it's on the small side so order a couple if you're sharing with a big table. I also had the mole enchiladas in which the ingredients seemed rather simple.

My recommendation would be to go for the cocktails. If you want order food, then grab a few plates and share as they're on the small side.

Chic joint offering mexican/central american inspired cuisine and some serious cocktails. Walked in here around 8pm on a sunday evening and were able to get a seat in the cute little back patio without having to wait. Not much in way of a view but it was nice to sit outdoors. They also have a couple of seats at the windows facing Smith St along with the regular inside seating.

Started off with a couple of cocktails since that seems to be one of the USPs of Leyenda. Got the Grass Roots Persuasion and another one served in a skull shaped container, the name of which I cannot recall. Both were well presented and tasted phenomenal. They run a little pricey but are solid for the $. For food decided to get the house made guac, fava bean empanadas and the pupusas. Guac was great, served in an avocado skin and came with fresh chips and salsa. The empanadas were delicious as were the pupusas. Full marks for presentation on everything - drinks and food. They really do put effort into it which reflects in the dining experience. My only quip was that the portion sizes were rather small although we did only order what would traditionally be considered appetizers. A few more vegetarian items on the entr√©es would have been great. Service was on the slower side but friendly regardless. Will be back again for their cocktails and to check out their brunch.

Came in late yesterday afternoon with a baby stroller , the host was very accommodating and sat as at a lovely corner table on the back patio.   Our server was very friendly and efficient , I ordered a house margarita and chips & guac , while our server recommended the empanadas.   Everything was fantastic , can't wait to come back and try more.   Good job Leyenda !!

Drinks were awful and served in kitchy plastic cups that were maybe not even food-grade plastic. Service very extremely slow and then it was smarmy/hipster. Food was catastrophically bad. Cool igloo in the back yard.

Fun place! I came here for drinks and they have a decent happy hour with good options. The food is a little on the pricy side but the food is good so worth it. I like the look of the place- has a rustic Mexican feel and the service is good. I had the hora drink- refreshing, with a kick of spice. Is a little more of a summer drink I would say cos of the fruitiness.
Come here for a date, it is on the quieter side unless it fills up so is good for conversation.

The most important thing about this place is it offers small plates. I'm not a big eater so I like the small portions.

I was here with my son and husband they're bigger eaters then I so we ordered six small plates what a variety!

I imagine this is a great after work stop as it offered  happy hour prices which were a bit pricier  then what I am used to coming from a small town but that's the way it is when the country mouse goes' to the big city!

The food was great. No complaints at all. I enjoyed every bite of it. It was pretty empty and quiet for breakfast which I needed. You order your food they bring it to you and you dump your tray when your done. Can't wait till covid is over so they can have their full menu again.

It was drizzling out and I had to find outdoor seating for a group of 6 to unwind for late lunch. This place also just happened to be a 4 minute walk from where I live, but that was a happy coincidence.

What their operations look like right now is attached. 6-7 tables of people that can fit 6 people a little snugly but still comfortably. Order at the pick-up window, food and drinks. They yell out your name as you try to make sure you don't miss your food but also talk to your friends.

Kind of like how you used to fight over tables at Starbucks as a teenager in middle school to hang out with your crew? It's like that now but worse.

This place was even hopping on a Thursday early afternoon. At 3PM on a slightly just-finished-raining day, I was lucky I lived so close--most of the outside dining tables were taken. I guess not on a rainy day, though, the Park is right around the corner for a chill picnic.

BUT WHAT ABOUT THE WAFFLES ROSY?

Honestly, I got the salad with fried chicken. It's shreddin season, y'all. But I will say one of my friends was generous enough to let me half 1/8 of a waffle, and it was heaven. Maybe it was because I had just gone through some delicious lemony greens with juicy cherry tomatoes (it honestly was a great salad), but the fluffiness and slight sweet base of the waffle with the crisp edges and melty maple syrup was transcendent.

And then I proceeded to take a swig of maple syrup. Yeah, it's that damn good.

Pros:
Went to Sweet Chick last night to grab a quick bite. They have an outdoor section setup to order food and beverages. Food came out quickly! We had the fried chicken and waffles, which were delicious! The belgian waffle was moist and buttery. It literally melted in your mouth! The fried chicken was well seasoned and crunchy, delicious!  I've had their mac and cheese which I also love.

Cons:
The reason for 4 stars opposed to 5 was the seating. On previous visits during Covid-19, they had a few individual tables. Now they have about 5 or 6 picnic tables, with coverings- which is nice, but that seating is most beneficial to large groups. There were a lot of parties of two and everyone was hesitant to share a space because of social distancing.

I do understand that they're doing all they can to provide some from of a curbside dinning experience. As a consumer, I appreciate that and the respect and friendliness of the staff.

I first want to say thank you for the staff at Sweet Chick for being so accommodating and helping make this dinner so special with my dad. They let me put the tables together so he wouldn't have to be next to the open door and they let me sit until he arrived. You guys can't imagine how those small exceptions really meant a lot to my sister and I.

The food was awesome! The chicken was fried and seasoned just right. My waffle came with 3 variations of butter including this herb butter...delicious. The staff suggested this whisky lemonade combination...it was life in a cup!

The food and the experience were well worth the money. Thank you again Sweet Chick!

I didn't realize that this location was an order-at-the-counter type of restaurant with limited options but still enjoyed everything that I ordered.
Their chicken and waffles are unbelievable. The breading on the chicken is seasoned well and the hot sauce they provide is an excellent addition. The waffles are insanely good. I've never had better waffles-- so light and fluffy and not overly sweet but just enough. I love that they use real maple syrup unlike other places that give you the fake stuff.
Also ordered the Mac and cheese which was incredible as well-- very different tasting from any other Mac and cheese I've had. I guess they use a different blend of cheeses.

Will definitely be back for more! I just wish they had other waffle options like in the other locations

Pro tip- order the leg and the thigh with the chicken and waffles over the 4 piece tenders. My friend regretted her decision and ate some of mine instead.

The have tables and benches and although they don't require reservations it's good to know ppl have the common courtesy to eat and then dip.
The food is made fresh to order so it takes a min but this was definitely worth the wait. The waffles fries were the TRUTH and the chicken with the syrup .. to die for.
Worth checking out!!

I love Sweet Chick, its been my go to for out of towners for years. Its bold soul food menu at a fair price. It was my first time in the Brooklyn location. They been doing a great job during Quarantine - they have benches all over to sit, a simplified menu, music flaring. The atmosphere is great.
Heres are my areas of opportunities: the music was literally so loud. I'm shouting back and forth about my order. And it's literally happening with everyone around me. It also makes it challenging hearing when your order is called. The strength of the drinks I find questionable. Lastly the benches could end up being monopolized but that's not the restaurant's fault.

After riding in the ""Bike ride for Black Lives"" event, we decided "" let's go to Brooklyn to eat"". Little did I realize we would be riding/ and some walking across the Brooklyn Bridge to get there. I kept telling myself it will be worth it. Oh and the uphill ride on Flatbush Avenue to the restaurant- again worth it. A bIke rack was right in front of the outdoor seating made it perfect for us.

We ordered the shrimp and grits, a Nashville hot chicken sandwich, Jalape√±o cheese hush puppies ,  frozen pi√±a collado, frozen Ros√©. We were starving but the food was delicious. The drinks were thoroughly refreshing with a little kick.

Did I say, ""It's worth the trip"" and we will be going back, by car.

To preface this review, I've frequented the Williamsburg location many times. However, I was not a fan of the food at ""Lil Sweet Chick."" Conceptually, it makes a lot of sense given the covid world we're living in.

I ordered the Nashville hot chicken sandwich with a side of Mac and cheese. I was shocked when I received my food. I felt so cheated --- I spent $17 on the smallest portion sizes ever. Granted the food was tasty, but definitely not worth $17! I was also a little skeptical of the cook on my chicken. As I bit into it, I noticed my chicken was on the light pink side. It hadn't been fully cooked through.

If I do return, it'll probably only be for the full menu items, not the little school lunch joints they put together lol!

Lil Sweet Chick seemed like a really great idea, so I was hyped to try it. Got delivery and it was still reasonably fresh, so I got to taste things pretty close to peak. (Shoutout to Uber Eats!)
The sandwich and fries ($15) looked gorgeous. We even had a photo shoot moment. And the cheddar jalape√±o hush puppies ($10.... yes. TEN WHOLE AMERICAN DOLLARS) looked promising. I tucked into the hush puppies first as I know those go south not long after they cool.
Let me also say- I'm from NC, where these delicious little things are usually like $1.50 for a dozen, or free. So my expectations were priced accordingly.
Anyways. Bit in. Meh. It was a standard hush puppy. Kinda grainy and dry. Needed honey butter. Didn't taste any of the cheddar or jalape√±o? Had my BF try one, she agreed. Later on I got to one where the cheese was finally found. Jalape√±o was nowhere though- the green bits I think were scallion? Tried it with the provided remoulade style sauce, it was good, but I had some honey butter in the fridge that I used instead. Definitely not worth ten dollars. (And there were like 5 per order, to add insult to injury here.)
The sandwich was tasty, albeit spicy-ish considering there is a spicy option on the menu and I didn't get that. About the same level of spice as CFA's spicy sandwich. (Actually. It really reminded me of that.) The chicken portion itself was an even thickness and fried really well- very crispy and not oily- it actually made me think of how good their chicken n'waffles must be, with that buttery waffle and sweet syrup! Soft potato bun, a bounty of sweet pickle chips and an herb mayo rounded out their OG chicken sandwich. Their waffle fries felt super familiar, kind of soft and only crispy around the edges- paired very well with ketchup. Overall not bad, but as others have pointed out, significantly smaller portions and much bigger price tag than I would have paid *clears throat* at comparable establishments. Also their $2.50 beverages are cans.
So Lil Sweet Chick may not have been *just* what I was looking for tonight, but I'm still looking forward to going to the restaurant and trying their chicken and waffles!

Was walking through the area, was hungry, and did not want to wait until I got home, so to lil' sweet chick I went. First time coming to this location, and I had not been before they rebranded to lil' sweet chick. I only have memories from the Williamsburg location, and I did not enjoy that experience. But I don't think you can go wrong with chicken sandwiches.

The cashier wasn't very friendly. He looked pretty over it, but I tipped him well and kept it moving. I got the nashville hot chicken sandwich and a fros√©. Luckily the outdoor seating was pretty open (although one of the vacant tables had a paper bag on it and hot sauce spilled all over it--they don't seem to have anyone monitoring cleanliness after people leave), so I decided to sit and eat. The drink was good, nothing to rave about.The sandwich came out pretty fast, and it was hot (temp wise and spice-wise)...but the size was not worth $10. It's tiny. Good, but a snack, really. I think $6, maybe even $7 would be more appropriate pricing for it. I like spicy food, and the pickles helped a little, but it definitely could have used some sauce to cut the taste--so I would order one of those on the side should I decide to return.

The thing that bothered me the most though, is that they're not enforcing mask use for customers or social distancing. A couple people came up to the window with either no mask, or their mask pulled down under their chin when they ordered. Then one of the mask-less people decided to sit directly opposite of me while waiting for their order when there was a ton of space on the other side of the table. Social distancing and mask-usage requirements should be announced when people come to the window.

*There is also some sort of picnic basket menu item for around $40 that includes a couple of sandwiches and I believe 3 sides. That seems worth it for the price.

PURCHASED: Fried Chicken and Waffles ($19) + Biscuit, sausage with gravy ($7)
TOTAL: $26

PROS
+ Come hungry, leave full: The chicken and waffles was probably enough food. I shouldn't have ordered the side. (Note, I eat alot. Like I have 2 dinners on some evenings).

+ Vegetarian Chicken & Waffles: I had a bite of the 'fake' chicken (please see photo) and it tasted delicious. To describe it: It taste like a different type of meat. It's good. (Of note, I am a meat eater).

CONS:
- Pricey: It's a bit pricey. I mean $19 for some fried batter and fried chicken? Chicken is the cheapest meat when compared to beef, pork et cetera. Why so pricey?

- Loud: The restaurant is loud on a Sunday morning. Maybe not ideal for trying to catch up with friends or after a night of drinking. But, they are bumping some dope tracks (e.g., Beyonce, A Tribe Called Quest, R&B jams, et cetera).

- Long wait: We were told 45 minutes was the estimate time and that it could be longer. We waited for approximately 1 hour and 20 minutes before being rung to be seated.

IMPRESSION:
Went for Sunday brunch in early March 2020. Lot's of great things about the place. Though, the dining experience can be improved.

If someone else made another chicken and waffles joint, I am sure they would drive down the price for the dish here. (It would be a great business opportunity for others looking to do business.) The price here is expensive! Though, it did fill you up.

Great food! Cool vibe!

The missus and I walked around over to Sweet Chick for breakfast and enjoyed every bit of it. Usually on the weekend there's a nice wait for breakfast. We were told 35-40 minutes for a table for two. So we walked across the street to DNY Natural Land to do a little shopping. Five minutes later the hostess texted me that our table was ready.

We were seated by the window on this sunny day and had a great view of Flatbush Ave.  My wife had the chicken & waffles and I ordered the shrimp & grits with a side of maple glazed bacon. The service was great. Even though they were packed, we weren't rushed at all. Our server checked on us frequently and brought us more water.

This was a great start to a lazy weekend.

OMGosh!!! BOMB!!!

I actually ended up here on a whim. My friends and I were heading across Brooklyn to some other spot after an event we'd all been to. I spotted Sweet Chick as I was driving by and asked everybody if they'd rather stop in here instead.

We called to ask about the wait time (as we were sitting in the car 1/2 a block away) they said it's about a 30 minute wait. After the call, we decided to head inside and would you believe we were seated right away?

Idk why but I was actually quite excited when we sat down, I think I had this place bookmarked for a while but I hadn't gotten around to visiting. The drink menu was VERY inviting, I went with the ""Queen of New York"" a friend had the ""Christopher Wallace"", another the "" Sweet Chick"" and the last one had a lemonade (she'd had enough to drink for the evening by that point lol).

For dinner we all had chicken (big surprise lol) in some form. I chose the chicken bucket with a side of mash potatoes and an additional side of greens. The bucket came with a biscuit as well. My friends all had different versions of chicken and waffles, with one getting a side of the creamiest mac and cheese. I tried a piece of a bacon and cheese waffle. Everything was GREAT!

The space is cute, there's outdoor seating during the warmer months. The neighborhood is cute. Definitely going back!

This fried chicken is EXCELLENT and every side I've tried has been delicious as well! It's a bit pricey, and I find I have to order far in advance because they're so popular that the wait is quite long. But most of the time, when I'm not it a rush and I want to splurge, it is worth it.

The folks behind the counter are super friendly as well.

All the thumbs are up for Sweet Chick on Flatbush.

Love this spot! It has a fun ambiance and great food. I get the chicken and waffles here and the chicken is fried deliciously with the sweet complement of the syrupy waffle on the side. I've also had the shrimp and grits here which are very tasty.

They've also got great drinks, especially a good Bloody Mary for a Sunday morning. I definitely am overdue to come back here!

This is what I found in my waffle fries . A rubber band. Although I enjoyed the rest of my order (Classic Chicken & waffles) this was very disappointing and dissatisfying to come upon. This is amidst Covid. The establishment should be on their P's and Q's regarding staying sanitary. Extremely disappointed.

Sweet chick was fun! It is a main attraction in the area and is very small so you'll have to come in and grab a seat before rush hour or way later (unless in the summer where outdoor dining is available, more space). Food was good and chicken was seasoned and cooked to perfection but a little dry. The table syrup and hot sauce helped! Staff was very attentive and seemed to come around right when I needed something. I had a solo date but hardly felt alone with the music and interaction, it was a very pleasant experience.

To say this was a shitty restaurant is an understatement...

I'll begin with their outdoor seating. There was no indication, sign, employee, or anything that explained to customers that you are to order food at their window and pick a seat if you can find one. So my friend and I had to guess the protocol. That was the first of many shitty things.

Secondly, the food was mediocre at best. With such tiny portioned food, why the hell was it still priced the same? I had a shriveled up wing and what looked to be a third of a chicken breast with my waffles, oh and let's not forget the one small sized cup of syrup they gave me for my waffles which I will say, were tasty. But that and the Mac and cheese were the only good thing about this place.

The drinks! This location ought to be ashamed of themselves. My friend and I ordered boozy lemonade and iced tea. There was 0 alcohol in our $13 drinks. Like none at all. The guy at the front insisted he put alcohol in it and I'll admit my friend said she saw him pour the alcohol in it, however I'm convinced there was water in that bottle that he was pouring from. We were not buzzed, tipsy, or nice.

Overall, I will not being going here again. They're wack af and it's not worth it. Instead I recommend Tacombi which isn't far from Sweet Chick.

I've now been to every Sweet Chick location in NYC, and if you aren't tired of my other reviews from the other location, I got another for you here.

This particular location is in what I consider the heart of Brooklyn. The vibes are all what Brooklyn is like, up the block from the Barclays center. I might just start coming here for the literal location itself. Our waiter was really sweet and always attentive. I wish I got her name! But let's jump into food talk..

This place just knows what they are doing. Their drinks are creative, I couldn't even tell you what was in them but it was GOOD. The Mac and cheese just might be one of the best around. And their chicken and waffles? The chicken is juicy to the bone, they give you dark meat which we KNOW has more juice to it. The waffles I had this time were apple cinnamon and it was like I was eating a apple cider donut. Perfect balance for the chicken and Mike's hot. Sweet Chick remains one of my go-to's in this city.

Delish chicken and brunch-type digs at any time of day (including an in-between menu from 4-6 PM). I've been here and the location in Williamsburg and this one beats it in terms of overall space and ambiance. Great waffles as always!

I find getting one dish at any given Sweet Chick is typically enough to make most people full. Do this to avoid the inevitable sugar crash after and maybe have a cup of tea or coffee. Some stuff is a bit over-hyped but it's a bunch place, so you have little say in the matter in what really is ""over-hyped"".

The Hot Honey special is one of my favorite chicken and waffle dishes, and the mac is definitely worth trying. Be wary as things are very much on the pricier side here! Nas ain't playing.

One word...BRUNCH!!!!

I landed in New York and this was the first place I came too. My cousin is a native New Yorker and said she wanted to take me to a place that was very New York needless to say this was not disappointing.

Everyone was very nice and helpful when it came to the menu and anything NewYork and since I was visiting this was very helpful to me.

Luckily we sat at the bar because as we got there a couple was leaving, other wise it was an hour and a half wait time to be seated. Side note: it would have been worth the wait.

I ordered the chicken and waffles and let me tell ya they were delicious and came with three different types of butter...THREE!!!! From the pictures it may not look like a lot of food, but trust me it's plenty.

If you are in NY and want a good brunch experience this is the place to be!

Tasty chicken if you don't mind eating from a Petri dish. The guy working the register was not covering his face, even as some customers wore no mask while ordering at a very close distance. The customers were not asked to wear masks either - that is state law right now. I witnessed this as I waited 25 minutes for an order that I then found out was lost; needless to say I cancelled it and left.

This is my first time going to Sweet Chick during the day. The night crew has always been professional and clean, but these Saturday lunch folks were a disaster. I've been a regular customer since they opened, but I won't be back; this is why BK covid is out of control.

Sweet Chick is BACK as Lil' Sweet Chick and I couldn't be happier. Their to-go window includes sandwiches, a couple chicken and waffle options, fried chicken, and sides - including their Mac n cheese, which is out of this world good. I recently ordered the Nashville hot chicken sandwich ($10) and it was amazing. They are also offering a picnic special, which includes either two chicken sandwiches or four pieces of fried chicken + three sides for $40. Great deal for an outing to Prospect Park.

Highlight: chicken and waffles

I came here for brunch with my 2 friends on a weekday in the summer. We were seated immediately and greeted by the waiter.

I ordered a boozy lemonade ($13) w/ burbon and it was quite refreshing. I also ordered the chicken waffle sandwich with fries. The waffle was soft and sweet. The chicken was crunchy and flavorful. I think the sauce it was tossed in was bbq.

My friends both ordered the classic chicken and waffle and they asked for DARK MEAT so that it was more juicy. Also be sure to ask for their special butter (its free).

Overall I was extremely satisfied with my meal. Only con I have is that it was kinda of humid because the AC was not on and they have an open patio design.

Ordered takeout through Yelp and this was legit the best dinner I've had in months. Fried chicken was the perfect texture, moist and tender, with just the smallest hint of spice. Waffle was excellent; the seasoned butters were surprising and good. My daughter and I agree the mac & cheese was good enough we'd go back just for that. Order was ready at the early end of the twenty-minute pickup window and 100% accurate. We'll definitely be repeating this experience.

This was soooo good.

By the time we arrived, Sweet Chicks was on their condensed menu which is served from 3-6 pm. We had four options to choose from: Mac and cheese, a BLT salad, shrimp and grits, and chicken and waffles. The shrimp andgrits's were served with cheddar grits and a runny egg . The chicken and waffles came with two pieces of fried chicken breast and four thick slices of infused waffles. Waffle choices were classic, dried cherry, apple and cinnamon, spiced pecan, and rosemary and mushroom, and bacon and cheddar. They were served with four different types of butter: lemon, berry, classic, and herbs. For $2 extra you could order mike's hot honey on the side.

I ordered the chicken and bacon and cheddar waffles with rosemary herb butter. It came out quick and hot with powdered sugar dusted over it. I drenched it in their complimentary hot sauce which had more of a vinegary spice to it than any real heat. But I wish I had a travel
size of it to take it with me. I felt like my meal was missing something until I added it. Everyone at my table ordered their own version of chicken and waffles and we all really enjoyed it.

They also serve vegan chicken here made from seitan. I tried this as well and thought it was pretty good.

Great atmosphere and friendly service. The Flatbush location is right across the subway station so very convenient. Unfortunately I was too full to try the chicken but from the menu it looks like there are plenty of chicken and waffle iterations (definitely on my list to come and have these).
Instead I got a side chick (mildly spicy yummy drink) and a pistachio pie--I know right??? Id never had or heard of this before but it was Delicious!! Lovely subtle pistachio layer with whipped cream and a delightfully crumbly crust. Just yum!

Ok let's start with the bad because ....it was pretty bad. That bbq has was so just ....not good. I mean u can look att the picture and see it does not look appetizing at least to me. I tasted no bbq for one and there was a sour curry like taste. I hate sending food back and will normally justt but eAt what I ordered But guys this was so bad that I HAD to ! I could not eat it :(. Idk what the issue was but the server asked if I wanted something else and as guilty as I felt I said yess. I'm glad I did tho because the meal wasn't cheap ($15 I  think) and the chicken and waffles were AWESOME! that's why I was conflicted I didn't know if I should give them 4 or 3 stars.

The hash is most def a 1 star. But wveryting else was 4/5!!

Since they redeemed themselves with everything else I went ahead and gave 5 stars.

Now for the good!!...the biscuits omg the biscuits were sooo bomb!! I also got a smothered biscuit I think i t was and aLso th best thing I've had in a while. Best smothered biscuits ive had hands down. As well as the butters they were so goood I should've just eaten those for my meal! Hahah

The chicken and waffles was also good. Very filling and not greasy.

The spiked lemonades were awesome !! Wish it wasn't so busy all the time on the weekends or I i would def get my Sunday tipsy on there when I am off--which isn't very often . . So the fact they have weekDAY brunch and drink specials is amazing ! So happy because not everyone can make brunch on the weekend (like myself ) some of us  have to work and want to brunch on the weekday ! Well they have something for us.

Couldn't give a full 5 stars because of that hash. I am not sure if I just got it on a bad day but. The description just doesn't even reflect the presentation nor the flavor

Had a nice meal here. It can get loud but it has a fun vibe with music playing. We were told there was a wait but people had not been coming back so a 30-40 minute wait ended up being only 5 minutes. We had the chicken and waffles as well as the vegetable bbq has with pulled pork and split Mac and cheese. The hash was delicious. It had a ton of every aspect. Lots of baby potatoes, veggies (peppers, peas, onions), and a lot of pork. My only complaint might be a little too much bbq sauce. The Mac and cheese was VERY good. I don't think it needs the ritz crumble on top. In my opinion, it takes away a little bit because it tastes artificial and the Mac and cheese itself tastes very authentic. Look forward to coming back.

First time here my friends for dinner. They do not take reservations so the wait is usually pretty long, but we only waited 30 minutes. Once you give your name and number they will text you when a table is available.

I ordered the chicken sliders, Mac and cheese along with the strawberry salad. My friends had the chicken and waffles. The food was delicious and tasty. The service was prompt and friendly. Our waiter was attentive to our needs.

Overall, it's a great spot for brunch, lunch or dinner.

When I went to Barclay's for a graduation, I couldn't help but think of what to eat afterwards. Thank god Sweet Chick is only a couple blocks away. Came here with a party of four and we all decided to get the chicken and waffles.

Waffles come in various flavors, I decided to get the cheddar and bacon. It was delicious, the cheddar and bacon flavor isn't overpowering but you know its their. It went perfectly well with the fried chicken. Wish the chicken pieces were bigger but I can't complain, they were clean cuts and were fried to perfection.

I also had their lemonade, it was refreshing. Very hard to find good lemonade that isn't over sugared, this was just that. Great place to come as a group and the outdoor seating is convenient for the hot summer days.

I tried sweet chick for the first time when they opened their location in the city, I thought it was fine but nothing that really stood out. My opinion definitely changed this time around.

I came on a Tuesday for an early dinner a few minutes right before 5. They have an ""in between"" menu from 4-6 p.m. The prices are the same it's just limited in selection. You can get two pieces of fried chicken and a choice of waffle. They don't offer the specialty ones like buffalo until dinner time. You can also get the Mac n cheese, shrimp and grits, and BLT salad.

I got the rosemary and mushroom waffle, and shared the Mac n cheese with my friend. Loved the Mac n cheese, definitely rich and cheesy enough. The waffle was hot, crunch on the outside and soft on the inside, tasted great with maple syrup. Chicken was fried well.

Tables were sticky though... but food was good.

It's so funny what often draws people into trying someplace new. I have walked past Sweet Chick without ever flinching or really inquiring about their story until I heard that it was celebrity-backed.

I met with a friend at 4:30pm. Sweet Chick had a limited menu appropriately titled, ""In-Between Brunch + Dinner"" for patrons dining between 4-6pm daily. Great idea!

I had to order their popular dish, chicken and waffles. I never knew there were so many different types of waffles. Where have I been? I mean classic, bacon + cheddar, dried cherry, rosemary + mushroom, spiced pecan, and apple cinnamon. Huh? How am I supposed to choose? I weighed the pros and cons between spiced pecan and apple cinnamon, which won lol. If that was not enough, we were provided with three different types of butter. No clue what they were and I didn't bother asking, because I wanted my taste buds to do all of the talking. I liked the strawberry as well as the apple cinnamon butter. I was not a fan of the chive butter.

The ambiance was great, especially since we skipped ahead of the dinner crowd. The decor just set the perfect tone - relaxed and at home. Now that's the Brooklyn vibe!

Sweet Chick is conveniently located downtown Brooklyn, a few blocks from the Barclay & surrounded by other bars & lounges if you're wanting to do something after or before. All the locations are small & this one is no different. They do close at 2am, which is pretty cool if your looking for cooked food & not wanting fast food.

My friends & arrived after 12am & was told it would be a 30min wait, but luckily we only waited about 15mins. The menu prices are decent, but I felt some things were a little overpriced. For a beverage I had the ""Love Below"" which was decent & one of my friends had the ""Sweet Chick"" she thought it was ok & my other friend had lemonade with Tito's & said it was pretty light. For dinner I had the shrimp & grits & it had a poached egg on top & my friends got chicken & waffles. Now I'm picky when it comes to grits & it has to have cheese & be a certain way. I thought the food was ehh. My friends said their chicken & waffles was ok, but the syrup seemed funny. It didn't taste like maple syrup, although the waitress said it was. The syrup to me had like a coffee after taste...I don't know about that. I also tried their ""Queen of NY"" drink which was a interesting combination. It was courvoisier with ro≈õe & smashed strawberries at the bottom with some other mixer. It was good..but interesting.

Overall the service was fine, but the food was just ok. This wouldn't be a restaurant at the top of my list.

Was in town and my friends were raving about this place that rapper, Nas owns. It's a chicken and waffles spot in different varieties. I'm not a big chicken and waffles fan so I was hoping they would have chicken sandwiches but they only had the sliders. They were so good though! The bread was so soft and the chicken was so juicy!

Came to Sweet Chick after watching my Brooklyn Nets defeat the New York Knicks. I've been to the Williamsburg location, but the Flatbush location is a vibe too. I ordered the shrimp and grits, which had a tomato base and lots of flavor. The gravy is plentiful, so you taste it in every bite. The plate was topped with a poached egg, which I feel could be a littttle softer. There was lots of shrimp and it was good for the $26 price tag. The drink is called Numb Numb Juice, and it's made with Couvosier and hibiscus tea.

A kind tip (not related to service) is to bring bug spray if you happen to sit near the plants after the rain after dark because I got bit by mosquitoes a few times.

So the food and drinks were great. Lovely to sit outside. The heat lamp was perfect.  We occasionally had a lovely female server who was so kind but the other two men were far too uptight to allow their guests to enjoy their experience.

We abide, respect and understand the mask situation. We were told we only had 1.5 hours at the table, while having a reservation. So we felt rushed right from the start. Time passed and we were able to stay later which was nice also no one else had arrived needing a table. We told the waiter to let us know when they would be needing the table back. Mind you we racked up a pretty nice sized bill. Suddenly Instead of just dropping the check for us they just sharked around our table asking when we were ready and on my way to the rest room, the perfunctory host with the red sweat shirt asked me if we were wrapping up soon. I told him I believe someone asked for the check. At any time they could have dropped the check and instead chose to keep asking when we were done. Again we were spending money supporting their business not just sitting there with one drink all night.

When customers are at your establishment to support your business, all one can ask is that you don't be a dick to your nice customers. It's very simple. Personality goes a long way in the food industry. No one likes to be served with smug attitudes. Kills the experience for the customer and makes your food taste bad.

I really wanted to like this place. The outside was super cute and I love the idea of having seafood around the area! Unfortunately, this was a major disappointment and the only thing I would suggest getting here are their cocktails (but it's so expensive).

Overall, everything is way too overpriced for what it is and it didn't taste amazing. I also came here for brunch and I really wish they had a brunch menu instead of just a set menu that's for brunch and dinner. And everything on the menu was basically just super overpriced and not special tapas (sorry :( but that's literally how I feel).

I made a reservation at 2 pm (the time they open) and I we actually the first customer to walk in. I get seated but my chair has crumbs.. I kid you not, they did not do a good job cleaning. There were crumbs that were obviously either from last night or the staff's breakfast, just on the chair.. uh.. not super amazed. The hostess was nice and apologized since she saw me wiping the crumbs off of the chair.

I ordered drinks and food with my friends and errr everything is so overpriced and not that yummy. The shrimp cocktail itself was $12 and it came with 6 shrimps and they weren't good... then there was maybe 3-4 strands of asparagus for $13 (wow...) and the steak tartare for $18 that was not delicious (yikes sorry). The deviled eggs were whatever because.. they're eggs, if this was also awful, I'd be extremely upset.

I am only giving this review a 2 stars because of the cocktails. I honestly want to give it one star but I think the drinks were pretty good overall. I still don't think the cocktails are worth what it is and I also have to say that their happy hour menu is not really happy hour... $1 off of beer and wine. That's, wow. Not even your cocktails and just $1 off? Not enticing at all. Would not come back and would not recommend ever again unfortunately. And that actually brings me to 1 star just thinking about this happy hour rule and how overpriced everything is for what it is.

Oyster and cocktails!!! Would love to live in this neighborhood and make this my ""spot"" the cocktails are very inventive and offer something for every mood. But the raw bar is why we showed up and it was delicious.
With the oysters came a variety of ""flavor enhancers"" (taco, pina colada, carrot, shallot, etc) that came in eye droppers. Something new to try, but for me it masked the flavor of the oyster. I went classic and if adding one it was lemon or shallot.
Only draw back, a little noisy to have a smooth conversation friends across the table and wish they had the windows open. But this wouldn't stop me from coming back....just how I was feeling that night :) (no worries they had a cocktail for it haha).

Rustic yet modern interior with intentional, vintage-looking chairs, small tables, wooden bar. Random books and tchotchkes on the high shelves of the wall. That enjoyably intentional rustic, cabin look. Well lit, good space yet very inviting. Friendly, punked out waitress dressed completely opposite of the vibe, cuisine, which was a fun contrast.

Pretty inventive menu for a seafood menu, though not particularly large. And far from cheap, which is the biggest deterrent.

Their oysters are delicious, fresh. And they have a $1 happy hour, which would be a steal.

The charcuterie was creative; shrimp sausage was different )but didn't quite give shrimp vibes), always a fan of lox and dill, smoked trout rillette was yum, and scallop pancetta was yum.

The Roasted Prawns & Grits will put you at $25, but it was very heart, flavorful, and full of fish.

Really solid cocktails, very unique. All around great meal.

Nice, chill spot to hang out for drinks. We came for an early Saturday dinner at 5:30 and there were a few people sprinkled at the bar but plenty of tables open. We had our 10 month old son with us so we pulled the stroller right up to the table without having to fold it up. We had:

- Bread appetizer: good, big piece of warm sour dough-like bread. Accompanied by seaweed butter and some type of lobster butter
- Dozen mixed oysters: really fresh. Came with a bunch of droppers with interesting flavors (carrot, taco, coconut, ube melon) in lieu of your typical lemon. They all went surprisingly well with the oysters
- Deviled eggs: good, though on the saltier side
- Gem salad: refreshing, with fresh fruit mixed in
- Cavatelli: good, but really salty after you mixed in the cheese
- Skate fish: good, well cooked and not fishy at all

Overall the food was decent. The customer service was excellent. Maybe because we were the only customers eating but we had a bunch of requests through out the meal and they were more than accommodating. If we had a craving for oysters this would be our spot.

This is an awesome cocktail bar. The vibe is great, it's just as good for a drink at 2pm on a Saturday as it is 1am on a Thursday. Drinks are always on point; get a little experimental with the amaro and have a good time.

The food is fine but you should probably just buy another drink instead.

Grand Army would be the perfect location for a go-to restaurant/bar for me, as I live a mere two blocks away. Unfortunately I cannot justify coming here often, as there is a lack of bang relative to the amount of bucks one has to drop during an ordinary outing here.

Pro: the charcuterie board is delicious.  Consisting of four unique items such as octopus terrine, trout rillette, and others, the flavors are excellent and nicely contrast one another.

Con: above-mentioned board, while only an appetizer, is nearly $30 and really leaves you craving more food for that dollar mark.

Pro: dollar oysters at happy hour, woo! One night the oysters were even Wellfleets, which are reliable.

Con: the most recent time I had said oysters, they tasted fishy and quite slimy. Yuck.

Pro: lovely decor and overall cool space, on a beautiful street. I do love when my girlfriend and I can snag a seat at the front window when it's light out.

Con: the place gets absolutely jammed to the point where I simply wouldn't dare test my anxiety levels by walking in. Also, being on State St results in elevated price points across the menu.

So overall I have mixed feelings about Grand Army. There are parts of it that I love (the bread and butter appetizer is actually outstanding), but certain aspects keep me walking past far more often than not.

I've been twice and I really enjoy the intimate atmosphere. It's a beautiful little gem and has delicious drinks, though the cocktails are pricey. They're made very well though. I know they also have an oyster happy hour which is a bonus for a lot of people (but not me). Good service, clean spot, will go back.

I'd prefer not to sit on backless bar stools but that's how they get you in and out quicker. And if that's my only complaint then they're doing fine!

Thought this was a very cool cocktail bar. Have not tried the food yet, but expect to next time I'm back. Their drink selection is fun. I particularly liked the monster truck theme and has to snap a picture to send to my brother. Drinks were prepared well, service was good and ambiance was charming.

The wait can be a bit much if you're only getting a drink and snack at the bar, but if you want great $1 happy hour oysters, this is the place to go.

Grab a glass of wine and a couple oysters. But most importantly, try their deviled eggs that get topped with fresh crab, you won't be sorry and your taste buds will thank you!!

I have been to Grand Army a couple of times now, which is no surprise considering I live a block away. The decor is very hipster chic and easy on the eyes, with fun posters and random collections of trinkets occupying various corners. The staff is friendly and attentive. Food menu is not very long, but changes periodically. The cocktails and oysters are the real stars here.

Daily Happy Hour is all about the $1 oysters - one type of oyster will be marked down from about $3.50 to $1, which obviously is a much better deal. I love the unique flavor infusions that come with the oysters, like taco and smoked cucumber. The drink deals during the happy hour are really nothing to write home about - just $1 off all glasses of wine and draft beers.

Truth be told, the food prices are a bit high for the tiny portion size. However, I do feel like the quality is there, which leaves me feeling slightly better when signing the check. The seafood charcuterie board is a favorite of mine, mostly for the smoked trout spread (which I swore to my boyfriend I would attempt to replicate at home) and the shrimp sausage.

There's no doubt in my mind that I am on my way to becoming a Grand Army regular. Can't wait to see this place in the winter with their cozy little fireplace going.

Seems like this tries to be a neighborhood spot but with big city menu and prices. With a mainly seafood menu and an intensive cocktail list, it's easy to over order. Unfortunately while many of the items were delicious, the small portion sizes made it an unsatisfying dinner
Most of the ""entrees"" were over $25 and seemed more like tapas. I still want to come back the happy hour specials like dollar oysters at the raw bar but maybe not for dinner again ‚Å£‚Å£

Bar looked great and loved the quaint atmosphere! Food was ok and so was service.  Will not be returning due to the very snooty attitude if the host.  The host passively aggressively was not allowing me to use the rest room by rudely letting people cut and by telling me directly he is letting them cut me.  In addition these individuals were not required to sign a book and give personal information as I was asked to do.  These policies are highly discriminatory and unacceptable.  Why should some patrons be allowed to freely use the restrooms and other patrons be forced to sign a book and provide personal information.

Went here expecting to eat dinner and turned out to be more light apps and cocktails than I thought. The menu online did not match menu at restaraunt. I hate when that happens because I plan what I want to eat, and then my plans are all messed up!

The food is good don't get me wrong but its just not a satisifying dinner. We had the bread and butter which was amazing, great tasting bread and the seasoned butters it came with had great flavor as well. Then we had the seafood charcuterie. All seafood no meat like the name, but they smoked the compilation of fishes to taste like meat and even put shrimp in a casing like sausage. Very good again, but not filling at all and expensive. We ordered the goat cheese brulee which took the longest to come out for some reason, and was legit just a huge wedge of goat cheese carmelized on top. Tasted very good though but way too much cheese since they only gave us 2 bread crisps to eat it with. We had to ask for more bread. So mostly our dinner consisted of bread.

Saw a lot of people ordering oysters and they do have a happy hour where the ones from Virginia are 1 dollar a piece. We are not oyster eaters though. We wanted to try something we saw on thier online menu that's why we went there and then they didn't have it...

Cocktails are every good. A lot are very smokey.

Really cute environment too, very nice and relaxing. They play heavy metal music which is an interesting juxtaposition to their light menu and pretty decor.

Never been to Grand Army but friend suggested we meet there. Grabbed some seats at the bar and waited more than ten minutes to get a menu. Waited even longer to order drinks and oysters. The oysters came with some wack sauce-Melon!!!! and Taco!!!! and silly eye droppers  I asked if they had just the classic mignonette but they said no so I asked for Tabasco they didn't have that either. If you're going to serve oysters, you got to at least have Tabasco. I wanted to order more drinks to cleanse my taste of the oysters but bartender never came over to ask if we wanted another drink. Finally had to ask a waiter for the check

One star for proximity
The other star for available seats at the bar

I have been here for both brunch and happy hour. Think this spot is more worthit for happy hour special ($1 oysters) & nice cocktail service. Added plus, on a blistering cold winter night they had their fireplace going. Love the ambiance albeit it can get loud.

We stumbled upon this place walking around the neighborhood, and wow, we were so sorry we had not discovered it sooner. It has a relaxed and chic feel to it, we sat comfortably at the bar and enjoyed great conversation with the staff.

But it was the drinks that were the winners, they were crafted with care and the staff really offered unique selections. We asked for a gin drink, and the bartender made us a creation he had recently came up with. It. Was. Stellar.

Additionally, the food was amazing - surprisingly good seafood and oysters. This place is worth the time out of your day - stop reading this review and head on over there!

Pretty good atmosphere, crowded but cozy and intimate setting. Good place for a date, but expect smallish portions and highish prices.

I shared a dozen oysters, my favorite part were the different sauces which come in little droplet vials which allows for great precision when applying to your oysters.

Also shared the ""seafood charcuterie."" which was alright. the best thing in there by far was the smoked trout dip. Other items has somewhat strange texture. Small portions.

Overall, good intimate setting. Somewhat pricey and small portions.

If I lived in the neighborhood, this would 1000% be my go-to spot. Happy hour oysters + good cocktails + extensive menu for brunch AND dinner + cute atmosphere means this place checks all the boxes. It even has a fireplace in the winter to create some cozy vibes that are a must for me this time of year.

This place is known for its oysters that come with a set of droppers with unique sauces to put on top. Honestly I am a fan of just keeping it simple and sticking with lemon but I totally appreciate the appeal and thought it was really fun!

For food, I have had the mussels twice and they are my absolute favorite. They are always really big and juicy mussels and come in this fantastic spicy coconut sauce. It was a really big portion as well so I recommend you share.

The cocktails are also phenomenal. They offer a daily ""bosses cabinet"" for $12 which has never let me down. Most recently it was a mezcal negroni, combing two of my favorite things into one - #blessed.

Everything one can possibly loathe about Brooklyn in one grossly pretentious hipster self hatred den.

1. I asked for a men's room and was sarcastically told that the UNISEX bathroom was in front of me
2. Place famous for oysters but OUT of not one ...not two...but THREE out of six oyster selections.
3. We eat oysters with saltines...we bring our own to all restaurants on this planet and have never heard an I'll word..from a single restaurant...ever!  at this pretentious shit hole...we were told that the oysters don't come served with crackers and to put them away..and were literally not allowed to eat their fishy oysters the way we enjoy them.
4. No horseradish or cocktail or Tabasco ...only ""tinctures"" hahaha wow ...pretentious much!?!? Carrot ""tincture"" for an oyster !!? For real? Can you over complicate things more ?

All this plus dumb insanely loud music ...ants (YES ANTS) ...and awful pretentiously complex and overly sweet cocktails makes this place a keep-away-from ...by anyone with self awareness outside the ages of 28-35.

Never come back ...

We had a small group at the bar area. The drinks and food are overpriced. The plate of pasta was drenched with sauce and it was so small for $20. The waitresses were just downright rude. Meanwhile, they put gratuity on the check and they were just nasty.
I would NOT go back.
I would get better service and food at an Irish grub place.

I was excited to see Grand Army open for takeout as we survive through this pandemic.  I was especially excited to see lobster and other rolls on the menu. I figured I would get what I've come to expect at Grand Army: quality food at a reasonable price. I was disappointed. They were offering 3 rolls: lobster (of which they were out but its a pandemic so understandable), crab and shrimp.  My gf and i decided on the crab.
We also ordered a side of ceviche-i asked for the small. Starting with the rolls: Unlike other seafood rolls i've gotten at good roll spots in the vicinity, these rolls were teeny tiny. I think i ate my roll in 2 bites and was still starved.  I was charged for a large ceviche despite asking for the small (but hey its only $2 difference so whatever)-at least i think it was large as that was gone in about 2 bites as well. And we got 2 drinks which I can say were good.  So basically, for about $80 with tip, we had a tiny meal and went for a pizza after.  Sorry, i love you guys at Grand Army, i understand its a pandemic and restaurants are facing tough times and need to make more money on the food, but charging that much is ridiculous.  I'm confident they'll get it together and be back to their old selves maybe once we can all eat in restaurants again (if that ever happens ugh), but in the mean time, if you're willing to walk a bit, there are more affordable spots for excellent seafood rolls.

I live about a 5 min walk away and have been coming here since it opened. Being from New England, I'm always on the lookout for a decent seafood spot (which is harder to find here than you might imagine) and this one fills the bill. I can always depend on great scallops, shrimp, oysters (including a $1 oyster happy hr), you name it. In addition, last night my gf and I split a goat cheese salad that she said was one of the best salads she's had in a while. To quote her, ""many places overcharge you for a plate of lettuce and something on top that you could make on your own, this one was unique and delicious"".  Yes it gets crowded, but we had a reservation and after a couple of people near our table left the bar, it was no more crowded or loud than a average NYC spot. The bar scene is hip and the cocktail selection decent.  Recommended.

For beer, get the Mikkeller draft for some nice fruity note from raspberry.

Happy Hour on Weekdays from 5-7PM, Dollar Oysters + $1 off drafts or wine by the glass.

The Orange wine on the menu was not available so I ended up getting another glass of Orange wine (forgot the name) but it was really nice!

Super friendly service, attentive servers even though they are very busy, great cozy atmosphere and perfect place for a date or chill with a couple friends! I have yet to explore their food menu (except for the oysters) to make any judgement about the food. One thig for sure, I will definitely be back for more happy hours since I live nearby.

The food/drinks were good, the service was HORRIBLE! Since we got there our waitress (Christen) had an attitude, also she dropped the Tabasco sauce all over my friend's pants, we ordered a bottle of wine and dropped it in the middle of our table hitting/breaking a candle, dropped the wine all over us and food was all covered with tiny pieces of glass, she didn't even apologized, the manager came replaced our food, otherwise the drinks are really good, we ended up leaving the place because we all felt uncomfortable with the bad looks/attitudes.
When we got the check, we were charged for the full amount. If I'm in charge of a restaurant and the waitress drop a dipping plate of tabasco sauce on one of my costumers, then dropped a glass of wine on another costume, the LEAST I can do is give a compensation as an apology.
TOO BAD, looked like it was a great place.... won't be back!!

I was craving oysters and found this place via Yelp. Who knew that the presentation of oysters could be so well thought out? My goodness, the little bottles of flavor to sample from were AMAZING - I enjoyed the habanero the most, and loved that it was in the form of a dropper. The shrimp cocktail was also divine and I had two of the party people cocktail.

You'll find super attentive bartenders here, and really really good seafood apps. It does get a little noisy though, but you won't notice after a cocktail (or two) and an oyster (or six).

Every visit is a pleasure. This is by far the best happy hour in the area. No rowdy 20 somethings here. This hip mix/ oyster bar is a gem with its seasonal selections. A little pricey but you get what you pay for. Seating can be tight and if you want a table at peak time it will not be easy. Recommend this stop for drinks and appetizers before heading out to BAM or into the city for a night on the town. They need to extend their happy hour oysters till later in the evening.

had a blast Friday and had to take the time to provide a review. First, the oysters are the best deal you will get for a happy hour. $1 dollar a piece and the come with some really interesting drops with an assortment of sauces.
The handcrafted drinks are 13.00 but worth it. Ingredients are fresh and the flavors are unique. I have to admit that the staff did not seem very light on their feet and that is why I did not give them a 5 star.

It took way to long to get a charcuterie plate out to us and our waitress was not very receptive of the delay. however, the hostess did come around to check on everyone and even asked us if the temperature was too out liking.
Highly recommended for a date or happy hour but just as the first stop. come early or make a reservation.

I love this place for the oyster happy hour. One dollar delicious oysters - always fresh. The shrimp cocktail and the deviled eggs (topped with crab and crunchy stuffl) are the bomb too. But it is small bar and really loud. I mean loud. Though the bartenders tonight tolerated my annoying friends - smiles on their faces and all - so polite. Extra thank you to those guys.

Coded racism. Were my friends and I loud? Yes, but we were sitting at a bar hanging out after my bridal shower and the manager came over and told us people were complaining about us being loud and something about the integrity of the bar. It's 5pm on a Saturday and we're sitting at a bar arguing about rap music. We're all native New Yorkers and this bar is full of transplants. There was someone sitting at the bar holding a baby, but that's ok for the integrity of your bar.

My favorite neighborhood restaurant and bar. The oysters are always so fresh! The Thai chili clams are a must. I have probably been here twenty times and have always had to get these clams! The drink and food menu rotate by the season and always something new to try. It can be a little pricey because the plates are small and you need to order a lot but you also get to try a lot

From now on I want all my oyster mignonettes served in tiny medicine droppers. Fully functional and totes cool. This place is your quintessential Brooklyn neighborhood bar. Really tiny but welcoming.

Between the music and the conversation it was really loud for my taste, but glad I went. I threw caution to the wind and asked the bartender to surprise me with a bourbon and he didn't disappoint!

The only reason I didn't give this place a full 5 stars is because their cocktails aren't a part of their happy hour deal. And let's be honest, with the vast array of cocktails on the menu, you'd want to try them all, but that $13 price quickly stops you in your tracks.

What IS a part of happy hour? $1 oysters, beer and wine. The $1 oysters pulled my friend in and I followed. Never really been a big fan of oysters, but after 4 drinks, I'll try anything. And I did. They were delightful. Our bartenders Kevin and Matt were attentive and kept our cups full. Kevin made us drinks that weren't on the menu, so I can't even recommend any, but they were all good.

Not really a place for dinner. They had some some finger foods, but nothing was really appealing to me. After 20 oysters and 4 drinks (each), we left and had dinner somewhere else.

It's close to work so I will definitely return.

Went here with reservations for a group on a Saturday night. Our intentions were to grab cocktails and oysters before dinner elsewhere.

The interior is small, and it was LOUD. Like, not pleasant. Our waitress was fine but hard to hear.

My cocktail, the Seven Ravens, was great. It was large (I know, ice), and strong. A few others really enjoyed the Godfather Death. My husband got the Girl Without Hands and they should call this drink the Drink Without Alcohol. This was seriously a watered down Paloma. Someone else got one, too, and it was also watery as hell. For $14. Not sure what is happening there. This drink was so disappointing that I wouldn't go back unless I was with someone who really wanted to.

I can't speak on the food because I didn't want to eat anyone else's oysters since they were $3.50 a pop.

If I could give zero stars, I would. The bartender was incredibly rude when I came in, accusing me of ""being that guy that kept closing my tab after every drink."" I'd never been there before. Service was awful after that. Despite my better judgment, I stayed. He passed over me many times, seemingly on purpose, as it wasn't too busy.

The bar itself is incredibly overpriced, the place smells like very old fish (even for an oyster bar), and your presence feels like an imposition. Save your money and go to any of the fantastic bars in this area.

Vicente is a very caring and attentive server. He took great care of us even during Covid regulations. The mood and food were all amazing and consistent. Beautiful food on a tranquil Brooklyn city corner. Definitely recommend the shisito peppers and and corn! Love!! It's a whole vibe!

I cam here with my friend the other day (during covid). The drinks were really good, even over flowing. I had a mango margaritas which was really tasty along with the steak tacos. The service was amazing, we got seated right away and the tables were safely distanced. I loved how you have to scan a qr code to receive the menu so you aren't touching menus that have been touched. Also the staff gladly replaced my drink after a fly flew into it . I will definitely be coming back for more margaritas and tacos.

I'm so glad this place opened after quarantine. It is a great spot for delicious Mexican food and cocktails. 100% recommend churros for dessert. Our waiter's name was Vicente, a very pleasant person who provided great service and made sure all of our food needs were met. Definitely will be back!

We had the most amazing happy hour experience. Thank you to Vicente who made our Monday night not just a happy hour but an experience... we came on a whim and left elated. The outdoor seating was dreamy!

The drinks were fantastic, and Vicente adjusted them after the first round just how we wanted them. The food was delicious, and the conversation was next level. Will definitely be back...probably this week!!  If you can ask for Vicente, you won't be sorry!

I really enjoyed this place while my boyfriend did not so that's why the lower score for this spot.

We came on a Saturday night around 8 PM and there were plenty of tables open. I like the atmosphere of this place-  it had nice big open windows for outdoor seating and plenty of space to keep everyone distanced which was great.
When we arrived they were playing really great music that fit the vibe but then as the night got later they started playing generic pop music which ... I love ... but it made the restaurant feel less authentic and more try hard. If I'm at a Mexican restaurant I don't need to hear The Black Eyed Peas blasting through the speakers while I eat my dinner ... but I digress ...

I ordered a margarita which was fine. I wanted to get a frozen strawberry margarita but every additional change to a ""regular margarita"" was a $2 upcharge. it would've been $14 for a strawberry marg which felt excessive to me, but my boyfriend and I agreed that it's normal pricing for New York ... just felt kinda ridiculous so I stuck with a regular marg instead.

I ordered the chicken fajitas and my boyfriend got the special that evening which was snapper with a side of rice and beans. He did not enjoy his meal at all - it wasn't anything special or exciting and felt bland for being a ""special"" he said it felt barely seasoned. The chicken fajitas were excellent - and the veggies were probably the best part- they were perfectly roasted and very flavorful - I honestly liked the veggies more than I liked the chicken. We ordered the churros for dessert and they were wonderful.

My only other beef with this place comes at the end. We asked our waiter for the check and waited about 20 minutes - he never came back. He kept tending to another table of his with two young pretty girls and never once came back to check on us. He spent a lot of time flirting and chatting with them and completely forgot about our check. We then asked one of the bus boys who apologized and left seemingly to go tell our waiter .... another 20 minutes go by and still no check. I kept trying to get our waiters attention but he would not even look over at us. Finally after waiting 45 minutes for our check we got ahold of another waiter who wound up bringing it over for us. This reason alone made me not want to return because it just got really frustrating - especially because we wanted to leave. I'd come back here to have a drink with a friend or maybe for more of the veggies but the lack of focus from our waiter was a huge problem for me - no one should wait 45 minutes and have to ask 4 times in order to pay....if you don't want my money, I won't wait around next time.

If i could give this a 0 i would, the guac was cold and had no flavor, the shrimp tostada also had no flavor, the steak quesadilla was similar to a deli quesadilla, honestly you can't mess a quesadilla up but they did anyway. The enchiladas were 22 dollars and came with just the enchiladas which did i mention that they also sucked? Yea well they did I'm baffled at how this place has almost 5 stars I've had some delicious Mexican cuisine and then there's this a completely mediocre excuse to overcharge people. Chelas in park slope is 50x better than this, do yourself a favor don't come here.

Thai place opened up a few months ago and we've been wanting to check it out for awhile now so we went last Friday. Its a super cool chill spot for drinks and food.

The atmosphere had a very loung like vibe. It was dark and they had some good Spanish music playing. People were friendly and fairly quick. The decor looked to be very chill and relax.

Food was excellent. I didn't order too much besides the nachos and side of plantain but it was very tasty. The drinks were strong as well. They have so many variations of tequila there

Wow! What a pleasant surprise!
I chose Las Santas based on the Yelp reviews and proximity to the BAM Harvey Theater.

I didn't expect to be so wowed by:

A brilliant whole grilled branzino -- not on the menu, but possibly the most perfectly cooked and seasoned whole fish I've ever had in a New York restaurant. It was dynamite and a great value at $28.

A fabulous perfectly cooked plate of fajitas generous with a variety of smoky grilled vegetables and fresh homemade tortillas.

Delicious, potent, nicely balanced cocktails.

I can't wait to come back.

Photo of Las Santas - Brooklyn, NY, United States. Not on the menu, but glad I asked about the fish! The whole branzino is the most perfectly cooked and seasoned whole fish I&#39;ve eaten in NYC.

Upscale, trendy Mexican with surprisingly large menu. Pozole soup was thin and unfortunately lacked flavor. The rest of my party seemed generally underwhelmed by their entrees but my tuna tostada was actually quite tasty. The Mezcal margarita was delicious.
Decor is beautiful and restaurant sits in a generally great location. Service was also friendly.
Honestly, I think they need to jack up the flavor level to create returning customers.

Yum!

We are so glad that Las Santas opened in Brooklyn. Food was delicious and the drinks really shined. We loved the mezcal cocktail (la suegas?)

We started with the guacamole which was chunky and flavorful, served with homemade chips and salsa. Add the chiccharron and you won't be disappointed. It was amazing

We also had the shisito peppers with corn which we loved

For entrees I highly recommend the shrimp enchiladas - the flavors blended very well

The only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the ribs. It fell off the bone and was good but flavors were much more mild compared to the other dishes

For dessert we had  the churros which was the perfect ending to the meal

Yes yes yes. This place is beautiful inside, has great service, and delicious food and drinks. I really couldn't ask for more. The aesthetics in here were really hip. They have a bar area along with a big and beautiful restaurant space in back, complete with an open kitchen.

$9 MARGARITAS. Yah, you read that right. I got the guava margarita and it was perfection - not too sweet, and all fresh ingredients.

To eat, we got the ribeye chicharon guacamole, fish tacos, chicken fajitas, and shrimp enchiladas. The enchiladas come with a really impressive spread of mixed vegetables, delicious crema, and rice & beans. The shrimp enchiladas are delicious... but you must love creamy things to enjoy that dish! To scale, the fish tacos are smaller than the other entrees (and half the price), but they were probably my favorite bite of the evening - and I've sampled a lot of fish tacos.

One of my favorite things is that they mixed purple corn tortilla dough with white corn tortilla dough and that made these beautiful tie dye tortillas which also tasted fab.

We finished with the key lime pie which was very tasty. I highly highly recommend this place to anyone who lives in the area! It's definitely going to become my new neighborhood go to.

Came here on a Saturday night, with no reservation and we sat down right away. There wasn't many people inside either.

Right when you walk in, you are greeted by a hostess and to the left is the a bar with small tables. We decided to sit inside, which was fairly big and roomy.

The interior is super cute, with white/ grey decor. They have an open kitchen concept which I really do love.

Our waitress was super sweet, and attentive.

We ordered their guacamole to start and it was DELICIOUS, it was so freshly and chunky.. exactly how I like my guacamole. They also give you chips and salsa right when you sit. Plus for me ;)

For dinner, we both ordered their steak fajitas. It was really good, the veggies were seasoned so good, it came with a side of rice and beans and it was the perfect amount.

One thing I do have to say, we ordered our steak Medium and it was wayyyyy overcooked. It was very hard to chew and bite into, especially while eating it with the tortilla and everything else.

Overall great food and experience but I don't think I would be back.

We really enjoyed our meal at Las Santas, but nothing completely blew us away.  The drinks were solid and reasonably priced, though we found them all to be a bit too sweet (tried all margaritas and a few specialty drinks).  For using fresh citrus (according to the menu), it seems a waste to make it sweet enough that it's hard to discern the acidity of the fresh citrus.  I really enjoyed the Michelada, a really good version of it.

For food, the Guac and Queso Fondido were both really enjoyable.  We were running out of chips *constantly*.  It's weird to only get enough chips served to finish 1/4 of the guac or cheese, I realize they're doing so to keep their chip serving dish really nice looking, but I'd rather have an uglier serving dish and reasonable amounts of chips with my not-cheap guac and queso.

The mains were all satisfying though not electrifying.  I got the fish tacos and the chorizo&potato tacos, the fish tacos were definitely less impressive though good.  The chorizo and potato tacos were really good, I'd definitely get those again.

Service was really really good, everyone was super nice and attentive.  You got the feeling they really cared about you having a good experience.  The kitchen took way too long to get mains out, though everything was hot when it came out, so it could have been much worse.

We'll likely be back whenever we're interested in staying in the hood but getting really solid mexican food and cocktails.

A friend and I tried this spot out on a Friday night before heading to a Brooklyn Nets game. I really enjoyed the vibes of this place. Large restaurant, open kitchen, dimly lit, and noise levels were perfect to have a conversation without yelling. Perhaps it was the heat from the open kitchen, but it was incredibly hot inside the night we went.

One con was the chips and salsa. Usually these are complimentary but they charge $3 and granted the portions are not that big. Expect to order more than one if you're a chips and salsa person.

We both tried the guava and mango margaritas. These were 5/5! Not too sweet and not too strong. The fresh mango and guava juice was also a nice touch.

I got the chicken in adobo sauce tacos with a side of rice and beans. While the meal itself didn't blow me away, it was very good. The chicken was cooked nicely and the presentation was solid.

The service was also excellent! The staff was very attentive and quick to our needs, especially for it being a Friday night.

If im in the area again and I'm craving Mexican food, I'd definitely stop back!

There are very few Mexican restaurants I can call exceptional in Brooklyn and this is by far one of the top! The food is not only so colorful and beautiful but it's delicious. Aside from the amazing happy hour which gives you three mini tacos and a MARGARITA, beer or wine for $15 (you can also get mini empanadas) the margarita is the true star! I love margaritas and I highly recommend you give this one a try. One of the best margaritas I've ever had ! It hit the spot. The vegetarian tacos were delicious charred broccoli, colorful presentation I couldn't ask for more. If you are not into happy hour the regular menu is also filled with options. My friend got the chicken tacos and said it's one of the best he's ever had. Everything is very CLEAN. Waiters are wearing gloves and a mask. They even offer a way for you to pay with your phone so waiters don't have to touch your credit card. Outdoor seating is great and everyone has a safe distance away. I can not recommend coming here enough. One of my top Mexican spots in Brooklyn. Get the guacamole!!

Plenty of outdoor seating! It was packed on a weds for tiki night. Music is lively, Service is awesome and food came quick. Staff wears masks and gloves. The bathroom has a push door so no need to touch any door handles! I brought my little pup who sat quietly under our table and they were cool about it. The drinks are strong and tasty. I got the mango island (Rum base) and he got the sharknado (whiskey based drink). I'll be trying the pina colada next time since I see a lot of people ordering that with their meal. The corn and peppers are YUM. Guacamole portion is a bit on the smaller side but still tasty. The soup is FAB. Will definitely get that again especially as it gets chillier through the months. The tacos come with 2 in a order which is perfect for me since I can never finish 3 plus all the apps! Fish taco is . Not overly fried. Fish is flaky and not too much breading. The carnitas taco is heavier but good; with a lot of meat and fried pork rinds on top for a nice crunch! Flan is good but on the richer side. I'll try the churros next time. So glad this place is a short walk from our apt!

Tried this place on a Sunday and it wasn't crowded at all. I ordered the steak fajitas with a side of guac and a spicy margarita. The steak was good but the rice was undercooked and the beans lacked in flavor(could've just been the cook for the day). My margarita however, was amazing! My server was awesome and attentive.

The food was delicious, but the impeccable service made it all that much better. From the moment we walked in - whether it was someone taking off our coats and bags and hanging them for us, or proactively replacing our order after a mishap in the kitchen, we felt truly taken care of during our time there and def would go back anytime!

Went here last Friday for drinks, with the thought that they had a great happy hour. Unfortunately we were told there's no happy hour on Friday, wish that was indicated on the site. Me and my friend ended up getting margaritas (mango and guava). The guava was better. Both of the drinks were great. Not too sweet and you could taste the tequilla. We then also had the queso fundido which was pretty good.  It was served with tortillas (3) which is interesting, but we were able to finish it off with the chips that we were served with prior. Me and my friend weren't extreme fans of the salsa that was served with the chips, didn't feel tomato based.

The inside decor is super nice and cozy and there's plenty of space. Def will come back to try the entrees.

4.5 stars - really exceeded our expectations!

The ambience here is really nice and would be cute for a date night or dinner with friends. The bar area is perfect for watching a game; not cramped at all. We were really impressed by the list of $9 classic cocktails - Las Santas does NOT skimp on the liquor at all! These were STRONG and not watered down. Loved the mango margarita and the Paloma.

Food portions here are also super generous. My husband ordered the Pollo Borracho and I ordered the steak fajitas. Both had superb flavor and my steak was cooked perfectly. We even had enough to bring back a little something for our pup :) our only complaint is that the rice was a bit undercooked - kind of dry and clumpy. Otherwise everything was delicious.

We also loved the complementary tortilla chips and salsa, which tasted really fresh. Service here is fast and very friendly. We will definitely be back!

Stopped in after a Nets game for a couple of drinks and some food.   The place was pretty empty when we arrived.  Got seated  in the front by the window.  Ordered our drinks + some queso fundido & chips & salsa + 2 orders of tacos.  Then our waitress disappeared.

We had food runners bring our food & drinks.  Nobody ever stopped back ever to ask how things were.  We sat with empty drinks for nearly 20 minutes....  then had to flag someone down for our check.

Food was average, nothing worth coming back for.  Salsa from 'chips & salsa' was so tiny I thought it was a joke.   The vibe is cool - but service leaves lots to be desired.

My friend and I decided to check out Las Santas around 9:30pm on a Saturday due to the glowing Yelp reviews.  Maybe it was because it was a holiday weekend, but we luckily found parking next to the restaurant!  Also, the restaurant was not busy at all, which surprised me for a Saturday night.  The ambiance is classy, but the music was way too loud, in my opinion.  I feel like the music can be louder near the bar, but should be set at a level that allows people to hear conversation in the dining room area.

We started with a guava margarita and habanero margarita ($9/each).  If you're like me, and don't drink a lot, don't fall for the reviews about the guava margarita.  All I could taste was the tequila, but my friend said that he could taste the guava flavor.  The habanero margarita was much more refreshing than the guava margarita to me, and the kick was there but not overwhelming.  Anyway, I made the mistake of taking a sip of the margarita before the food arrived (which took a long time), so it made me sick so the rest of my review may not be as accurate.  We ordered the nachos ($12), which our server told us was HUGE.  I definitely wouldn't say huge, but if you were craving a lighter meal, the nachos could probably serve as an entree for one person, but it was a good sharing size for 2 as an appetizer.  The flavors were delicious, I just wished the chips were a little less crunchy, as my jaw started getting sore toward the end.  We then ordered steak tacos ($14) and fish tacos ($13).  I was disappointed by both the portion size and flavors of these tacos, especially for the price.  The toppings on the fish taco didn't really complement the fish and the fish itself did not have standout flavor.  My friend said that the steak tacos were decent, but also lacking in size for the price.

I read other reviews that raved about the service, but the service was awful.  Maybe if you come later at night when things are winding down, service gets worse.  It took a while for someone to greet/take our order (10+ minutes), for the food to come (30+ minutes), and there was no water refilling or any check backs once the food came.  Overall, I do admit that feeling sick affected how I felt about things, but except for the nachos, nothing really impressed me as a standout compared to other Mexican restaurants in the area.

Love Mexican food ?? Me too' can't go wrong  with Las Santa's .. i love the ambiance , it was lunch time so it was a cool vibe . The window seating  is great , drenched with natural sunlight , the bar has a wide variety of liquor . Our waiter  name was ""Andre "" he was a darling ! The food was great ! Parking is limited because of the busy down town traffic . But  the food is definitely  worth your while , i feel like this  place can  be family and kid friendly ! GOT MY VOTE

Such an amazing find!! Came here for happy hour after work on Friday! The space is amazing as the restaurant has an indoor/ outdoor feel and also tables outside. Happy hour ends at 6pm and they have great (somewhat small) margarita specials. My husband and I also both ordered the chicken tacos which were so delicious. We ended up ordering their entree size once happy hour was over since we really loved it. We also had chips and guacamole for the table. Great scene! It was pretty packed so the waiter didn't come around as often as I would have liked but what can ya do? Highly recommend this place.

572 Fulton has been plagued with constant turnover of restaurants. A previous installment (Lady's) promised authentic Latin cuisine but ultimately fell short of its lofty goals.

Now, finally I hope Las Santas is here to stay as we finally have an establishment that delivers on all that it promises and more.

Coming into the restaurant, the storefront is deceptively small as the entryway opens into a large foyer. Modern Spanish is the name of the game here as perfectly placed lighting installments and a full open kitchen grace the dining room.

The menu offers variety without being too cluttered with a plethora of small eats and group plates.

Starting with the guacamole, it seemed fresh with ample chunks of avocado (no browning thus the freshness). Chips refilled upon request. The seafood campechana was a recommendation from our server and for the price point gave significant portions of seafood.

Some highlights I would point out are the Pork Ribs (braised and fell off the bone), the whole fish (fish is carted in daily), the tequila infused half chicken.

Our server, David was extremely knowledge and attentive.  Some things I would note is that when requesting for the WiFi, even though it was noted as available, the servers weren't familiar. I'd attribute this to recent opening kinks that need to be worked out.

Go for the food, stay for the value. 5/5

Everything about this new Mexican place is amazing. First of all, the bartender, Gabriel, is the best! Super friendly and great mixologist. Amazing food, super cool glassware for the drinks as well as dishware for the food. Super cool open kitchen concept; the flan is served as bite-sized pieces with a piece of popcorn on top that doesnt seem exciting until you put it into your mouth. Wow. What a perfect balance. All around good place!

(this is all before rona) went with my dad since it was the only place to eat after my physical therapy up the block, I think it was like 1pm. I had a sandwich and my dad had the steak dish. Solid food for a hub in that busy area. Bartender with the tatta was cool.

This is a good old fashioned bar. There are regulars, newbies, day drinkers and great bar food. There is a bouncer wed through the weekend and rarely ever more that 2 bartenders at a time.

It's a little homey and lived-in. No hooks on the bar for your purse, the counter is large so you've gotta slump over to eat at the bar, some of the chairs wobble, and the bathroom is tiny and run down. The drinks are a bit pricey, there are a few large flat screens around and a jukebox for music.

So why 4 stars? It has great bar food and good energy. Wanna hide away in the back and destress, sure, sit at the left corner table behind the bar. Wanna scream at you're favorite team on TV, feel free, pull up a chair at the bar and check out what's on tap. Or wanna meet with your crew and talk the night away, no problem, grab a high table on the right.

Now let's talk food...
BEST Wings in the area hands down! Meaty, well cooked, evenly divided and fresh. I like them dry with sauce on the side skin they stay extra crispy. Classic yet tasty sauce choices so you cant go wrong.

The turkey burgers are the bomb. Always juicey and filling.

The fries are simply delicious. I like the shoestring but the waffle are a strong second. Crispy, hot and made to order, salty, potato-ey goodness. They are a must.

So if you're in the area, stop by, pull up a chair get comfy and stay a while. All are welcome and you won't regret it.

Good for happy hour, parties, or just watching a game! Came on a Friday night. There were only available seats in the back. I believe there is a second floor too! The bar is dim and there are about 14 HD screens hanging on the walls that show different sport events. In the beginning, the servers were really unattentive. We went up to the bar to ordered the drinks from the bartenders. Later on, a waitress started coming to us and asking if we needed something. Their drinks are cheaper than most bars I've been to (Blue moon and Corona were $7 each and patron silver shots were $10 each). We didn't get any cocktails but they range from $9-$12. The only problem was their food. We only ordered chips n' guac ($8) and mozzarella sticks ($11). The chips were stale and the guacamole was bland. They served it with salsa on the side too. Had a fun night though!

Decent spot for happy hour food and drinks. Despite the location on Court Street in Downtown Brooklyn, the vibe is that of a neighborhood watering hole, as opposed to the corporate commercialism on display in the area.

I came through last week with friends for taco Tuesday. 3 tacos for $3 is a great deal, and the tacos got the job done. They are on the small side, so consider getting several orders.

Drink prices were reasonable, certainly cheaper than at artsy hipster joints, but with the corresponding reduction in selection. Note that they start a separate tab if you move from the bar to a table, do be sure to settle both at the end!

Good ol Irish pub in Downtown Brooklyn!  I honestly find it hard to find this kinda place in my area - everything has gotten so annoyingly ""hipster Brooklyn-EY"". Big, American & Irish fare menu, with burgers, sandwiches, lots of apps, such as Potato Skins (cheddar, bacon & scallions) - - really yum----nachos, chicken fingers, quesadillas, etc.  I have tried the quesadillas, and both my husband and I loved them!!  I saw a woman eating their ribeye one day when I went in there for a late lunch, and it looked amazing - served with potato & veg.  There are lots of TV's, and sports on, and I believe there is an upstairs too!  I'm def going to try a steak or steak sandwich next time!!
The bartenders are cool too!

I don't understand any of the negative feedback from this place- it really is awesome.

I mean if you have wine bar expectations, then yeah- maybe you're not going to have an amazing time, but if you're looking for a bar that always has a good selection of beer, good bartenders, reasonably priced drinks, good selection of sports on TV, enough space to bring a crew, and a business that chooses to support renewable energy- then you're good. Real good.

I recommend the nachos and fish and chips- also have you heard this history of this place? It's really a nice place to come if you're downtown for any reason.

You don't have to be an attorney or law student to grab a bite or have a drink here. Happy hour prices are a thumbs up. Or just sit in the back and order food. Different groups of people/friends can stand around the bar but not be on top of each other. I have had the wings a few times here and I like them.

Good:
-Happy Hour = $1 off all drinks
-Nicely sized spaced
-I order the 20 wings for a few bucks more than the 10 piece (bring the rest home)
-Beers come out as fast as you can drink them

Bad:
-Being PICKY...you can only get one type or one sauce on your wing order (can't order 20 and say 10 hot/10 BBQ)

5 stars for being the best sports bar in the area. Two stories, over 15 TVs, and slightly above average bar food. Full bar and standard beers on tap. The bartenders are super nice, too.

I want to love this place so bad, but it's hit or miss constantly. The food is great some days and awful the next. I do however love their wings. That's all they can get right.

But let's talk service, it's just plain awful.  At the  end of the day their waitresses are like a revolving door and they have yet to get one attentive one. It's not brain surgery.  The bar can be empty and there isn't a person to be found.

I keep returning here because it's a quick convenient spot, just wish their service and food was more up to par.

Great place to grab lunch, or simply come after work and unwind.. ms. Edel the bartend was amazing and very charming....
the French onion soup was the best I've had in a very long time and they kept It simple and traditional, which is a nice thing in these modern days of cuisine..

Plenty of tv's for game nights and two levels for plenty of room and comfort...
I would definitely recommend this spot for all your needs ...

Found this place on yelp but was pretty disappointed ultimately. The place was extremely loud, service was slow (and the waitress seemed like she did not want to be there at all), and food was low quality/not good. No napkins or silverware were provided or available. The waitress didn't come to check in on us and after waiting over 20 minutes for the check, we just went downstairs to close out. The wrong order was also brought out. We will not be returning.

Great place for drinks and amazing wings. They are well known for their honey garlic wings and for good reason. The honey garlic wings are very unique and original and is a must try. Their hot wings are amazing as well and have a great kick. Service is usually great but once in awhile you'll get a waitress who doesn't come around a lot.

I went to O'Keefe's my very first night in Brooklyn, after a long day of moving. In search of a sports bar with decent food to stuff my face with and ample TVs to watch a game, O'Keefe's delivered on my wishes. While there are more than enough menu items to choose from, they kept it pretty straightforward, offering traditional sports bar sandwiches and appetizers. I opted for the Philly Cheesesteak Wrap with American, which was delicious. I even believe it would have been this good had I not been extremely hungry at the time! There is also a vast draft and bottled/canned beer selection.

The atmosphere was great at O'Keefe's, as well. This is a very unpretentious bar, great for either groups or those (like I was) hoping to catch a game by themselves. No judgment, unpretentious, and friendly sum it up. Lastly, there are huge and huger TVs everywhere, so no seat is a bad one. I'll be back to watch games and chow down in Fall.

I had an ulterior motivation for causing a fuss over fear the sandwich in front of me would be inferior to the one I had ordered. My plan was to score two sandwiches by raising the issue of my wrong order, with the hope that they would not take away the food that they had already served. As they say, the road to hell is paved with cheap intentions.
I debarqued from my stool at the high-top to officially complain. The two waitresses appeared oddly pleased that I had brought the mistake to their attention and I walked away on cloud-nine as their smiles signaled goodwill and yes, free sandwiches. Yet, they yanked my original plate from the table with a zeal that made me think my ingenious plan was in fact far too common.
They served me my new sandwich and it sucked. The raw and thickly-sliced onions overwhelmed the sickly, chewy shrimp. There was zero dressing and the bread crunched like a stale booger. Rather than reinforcing my belief that the Shrimp Po'Boy exists, the ghastly sandwich had deconstructed my reality. 'C'est ne pais un Shrimp Po'Boy', the sandwich told me.
This story does not have a happy ending. My Saints lost their ball game and I got food poisoning. I was sick for 24 hours and felt the shrimp sloshing in my tummy while the sandwich continued to taunt me in my memories.

Came here for a 3rd time with a co worker & the I had the blackened salmon with veggies which was just string beans & carrots & yellow rice. The salmon was eh, the veggies were eh & the rice just wasn't good. My co worker had honey garlic wings which was good & waffle fries. I wish I would've got that. Since this is a bar, I guess it's not good to order anything besides finger foods.

The drinks are good & it's decent prices. Being that there in a very busy work area, it would be nice if there was a happy hour since it's a bar. $1 off drinks I don't consider ""happy hour"". The food was ok as well.

""O'Keefe's Bar & Grill"" is legit! It is a Sports Bar like no other. I'd like to tell you my story.
Parking is a huge issue around the business district, so I'm lucky I got there early. After a short walk it was hard to see the place because they don't have the name displayed above the building, just on the black glass windows, which is hard to see. Coming inside I immediately became excited with the look of the place. It's very modern and very clean with TV's everywhere. They even have a second floor with more TV's playing. When I was ready to sit there wasn't that many spots open because this place does business. They offered us at table and we took it. The waitress was incredibly nice and helpful, she was at my table often and cared about my enjoyment. The owner even walked up to the table and asked where we wanted to watch the Giants game. What! I thought that's cool. He was a really stand up guy and I'm not just saying that because he's obviously a Giants fan. What was better then the staff and look of the place was the food. I was completely taken back by how good it was. The popcorn shrimp was incredible and the sauce they used with it. Also the buffalo wings were delicious. They used a honey garlic sauce that was to die for. Finally my burger, now that was a burger. It had crunchy bacon, plenty of cheese and the onions were saut√©ed well. This place does sports well. I was completely satisfied and will return. What would make this visit better is if the Giants come away with a win.

When I'm not lawyering, Yelping, trading stocks or hosting dinners I'm solving the JFK assassination(what should really be called the Right Wing Coup of 11/22/63)......More about that later.

After the nice subpoena clerk in Brooklyn Supreme Court told me I had to come back in two hours because her office was closing, I had two hours to kill. I decided to plop my butt down at O'Keefe's Bar & Grill to enjoy a burger and brew and read ""The Dark Side of Lyndon Baines Johnson"", a book everyone should read.

A pleasant young female server greeted me in the dining area.After she patiently answered my questions about the respective merits of two Sierra Nevada brews, I chose the Pale Ale.

It came just as I like it: cold, refreshing and delicious. I ordered a Bacon & Cheddar Burger. The 8 ounce beauty arrived perfectly medium as requested. It was full of mineral flavor and luscious, making my taste buds do Karaoke.The generous portion of accompanying fries were of the crisp variety. They were tasty and not greasy.

For those of you under 40, the key to understanding the 1963 coup is googling ""Lyndon ducks"". But I digress.....after enjoying my great burger and brew I'm handed a check with my server's name........ ""Marina"".....the same as Oswald's wife. Synchronicity baby!!!!!!

Love this place! Me and the future hubby love coming here for drinks and food. The wings are amazing. However, the chicken wings need less salt. Definitely a great place to bring your girl/man.

The food is average here. We Went there for lunch there was no lunch special so we ordered from the kitchen menu. My colleague ordered a burger but it was too salty and they changed it to fish and chips. I ordered the Cajun chicken sandwich it was average for Cajun chicken really liked the fries though.

Went to O'keefe's for the first time on Friday after doing some local shopping, and needed to grab a quick bite before a movie. Was also hoping to find a replacement pub for our beloved Cody's which has closed. Ordered the basic pub staples, wings, burger, Ruben and buffalo chicken sandwich for our party of four. The waitress was upper attentive when we arrived, but once the food came out, it quickly went downhill. For starters, my buffalo chicken sandwich consisted of two flimsy pieces of chicken that barely filled the sandwich, vaguely tasted of buffalo sauce and consisted of nothing else, I mean nothing, no lettuce, no tomato, no sauce, just bread and chicken. We tried to get another drink, but our waitress was not around. Then when we got to the bottom of our fries and we found a long hair. Talk about being completely disgusted! We tried to get our waitresses attention, but she was still MIA. When we finally flagged her, and showed her the evidence, she said we needed to inform her immediately. Pretty hard to do since  she wasn't around. Not only did her apology seem insincere, she claimed to be unable to provide a discount because there was no manager, and she didn't even offer a complimentary anything to compensate for the issue. The service was poor, and the food was beyond unsatisfactory especially since it was far from crowded. Needless to say, we will never go back there, nor recommend to anyone, and are still looking for a replacement for Cody's, which now seems imposible to do!

Mediocre Irish pub, actually it is more of an American sports bar and grill despite of an Irish name.  It lacks all the traditional Irish food staples:
Corned Beef & Cabbage Casserole
Dublin Coddle
Beet Cabbage & Pecan Salad
Irish Soda Bread
Shepherd's Pie
Shamrock Salad
Whiskey Cake
Irish Colcannon
Irish Potato & Leek Soup
Potato Farl
Boxty

Saturday night out in town with party of two.  We dined to bacon grilled cheese $8.70 and one turkey burger $11.95.  No alcohol intake for either of us.  My turkey burger was okay as it was not juicy but MEH.  Service is extremely too efficient as upon sitting down we did not have time to scan thoroughly the menu to make a selection.

My sister and I went to have wings since it was .50 cent. I ordered 10 hot she ordered 10 honey garlic. Half the drums in the chicken was not done at all in either of our plates. Which was disgusting. Also we always had to find the waiter for our table but she was really nice. The best thing was the margaritas and the fries. I will go back again just for something different. If you do go here do not order the hot wings.

Best wings in Brooklyn hands down! They have $0.50 wings every Monday. There's no parking available other than street parking which is pretty difficult to find other than that this place is amazing.

This bar I have been to for years and by far the best experience was last Friday.My bartender forgot to get his name but he is very on point.This man knows how to pour a drink.Only thing that stop me from giving this establishment five stars is ,happy hour in my opinion could be better and no music really unless you playing a selection on the juke box.

O'Keefe's is a great bar and grill and is thus aptly named. I'm originally from Minneapolis where bars often have, well, bar food. Not so much here but O'Keefe's most certainly does and it's good. It isn't fancy and it isn't gastro spotted anything, but the food is quite good and comes out quickly so you can have lunch and get back to work or jury duty or whatever. I like the chili (bean or beef) which is your bargain yet filling dish. There is a salad special everyday and those are good as well. The caesar is no joke. Plus the service is great. The bartenders will chat you up or leave you alone - whichever you prefer. Note that if the bar and tables are full there is seating upstairs, though you would never guess it.

I've been here several times for lunch with coworkers. There has never been a wait to get seated.

We always get the wings because they're priced well. Combine them with a basket of waffle fries and a drink and we're paying just about $15/person.

Favorite wings flavor: Honey garlic. The wings come with blue cheese with everyone and there's some celery and carrots on top of the wings.

Your typical sports bar. It's never really been too crowded when I've gone in which is nice because you can usually just walk up to the bar and grab a drink or eat. The food is generally ok, but the wings can be pretty hit or miss. Sometimes they're outstanding and other times they're dry and kind of tasteless. It's a shame because their buffalo sauce is actually really good when they use enough of it. Wings should be messy and dripping in sauce, not half-covered.

The overall atmosphere is really nice though and the reason why I'm giving them four stars instead of three. It might sound weird to say this about a bar, but the place is really warm and inviting. The service is fast and friendly as well. Doesn't matter whether I'm alone, with my gf, or with a group; I always have a good time at O'Keefe's.

Horrible service. Overpriced food. No functioning air conditioning when it feels like over 100 degrees. This place is lame and should be shut down. $12 wings? What?!  And I'm posting a picture... empty, no service

Inattentive and unfriendly bartenders, they are more interested in chatting/gossiping with each other or being on their phones than serving customers. Draft beer tasted off too. Not an enjoyable place to have a drink.

Okay bar in Brooklynn my gf and I wanted to check out while in town. Inside feels like a good old school bar and I loved the atmosphere.
However, drinks were overpriced. I got a Bloody Marry and it wasn't that good, asked for it spicy and all I got was the mix and vodka but I'm sure draft beer is fine.

I've been a frequent patron of this location for years (thanks to my BFF, Pika). It has always been a super chill spot to hang out, grab a beer or some grub.

A very unassuming atmosphere with amazing bouncers and bartenders. The waitresses are another story, it's often a hit or miss with them.

Sometimes, they'll be spot on in terms of service and knowledge on what the specials actually are. Other times, a couple are in a dizzy, fluttering about to no where with a lack of attention to details on service and your order.

One particular waitress had the audacity in positioning her self to educated me on 'tipping' before I left. I was seriously offended  (as I work in the hospitality business), I'm known to be overly generous when I leave gratuities.  I did express to her ""... not to allow the brown skin to fool her"".

Aside from that incident, it's always a grand time. I also came here on St. Patrick's day to celebrate. I usually have the sampler, which is quite good (nothing five stars) but it's bar food and washes down easy with beers or Margaritas.

I wished I lived in the area, I'd be here weekly. Certainly a cool spot to check out before or after a movie at the near by theater or after shopping at Barns and Nobles or Sephora.

Food: best Mexican street corn I have had at a NYC restaurant so far. Good balance between everything. Chips were delicious. Didn't get anything else however.

Service: our waiter was nice and we got our food promptly.

Aesthetic: sat outdoors so I can't tell you whether it was good or bad inside, but they did good with social distancing and had heat lamps!

This place is delicious!!! It's nearby my job and came here with my bosses for lunch. We got tacos and chicken burrito. The al pastor tacos are the best! They're delicious. I love al pastor with pineapples and it's the best combination. the tacos came with a cute little cast iron pan with rice and beans. it was so good. We also got their fruity margaritas on the rock and they were delicious. not too sweet! the food was the best part and the service was great. our server was super friendly and prompt. it didn't take long for our food to come out. i will definitely be coming back here again! staffs were following covid protocols as well.

I was so amazed at how the FiDi location was such a great time. The outdoor dining experience was a wonderful thing. There are no reservations, but when you get there expect a wait. But it's worth it.

My friends and I ordered the margarita tower and it did not disappoint. Pretty strong drinks overall and I was surprised. It says it meant for four people but I think it's meant for more. Definitely worth the money because it's like 4-5 drinks each. The food was amazing too. I ordered chicken tacos and of course chip and guac.

I have been yearning to bring my friends to this place and I will definitely be returning before the year is up!

Good find, If you like authentic style street tacos I highly recommend. I started off with an order of the street corn, very tasty. Then for main dish I had the al pastor tacos with a red sangria to drink. The tacos tasted excellent and came with a side of rice and bean. The red sangria was a tad small but delicious. A fun location.

I've been coming to Mad Dogs for years and always enjoyed myself! The staff is very polite and professional as usual! I ordered their version of the Bulldog Margarita and it was great, even though I don't usually prefer frozen drinks! My only disappointment was I didn't see the shrimp tacos on the menu! All of the tacos are delicious however! I'm glad to see one of my favorite bars hasn't become a casualty to this horrible virus! Continue to stay safe Mad dog staff!

Packed and loud on a weeknight. A good happy hour place if in the neighborhood. Took us a while to get a seat since we arrived prime dining time. Despite the place being full, service did not take long.
The two of us split the mango margarita pitcher. It came in a big big portion. We had to really work on finishing it. Our waitress advised us against the mahi mahi taco since it was a hit or miss. We settled for the steak and pulled pork tacos. They came with a small side of rice and beans which i didn't mind. Food was overall pretty decent. Would come back for drinks and definitely to get guac next time.

This place is ALWAYS full and has a really stupid policy. If you are not having an entree you cannot have a table. That is nuts! I came with a party of 5, we were going to buy drinks and appetizers but simply could not find a seat at the bar. We asked the waitress if we could get a table and were told 'no, only if we are ordering food'. We were going to spend at least a few hundred bucks so they lost out on that. We left and went to another spot nearby and had a great time. Change that stupid policy; you are losing out on business!

I did go back and was able to have lunch one day with a coworker at the bar. I had enchiladas as well as (2) guava margaritas.  The margaritas were simply OUT OF THIS WORLD! I was intrigued to try a guava margarita and it didn't disappoint! Kudos to the bartender! The enchiladas were just so so. Didn't have great flavor. The rice and beans were good. My co workers tacos were good too (in her opinion). The place has a nice lively vibe but is always full no matter what time you arrive. Their table policy is stupid and the bar is cramped. If you going for a quick bite and don't have time for a meal, pray you get space at the bar. Otherwise you have to buy an entree to just get a table.

  Thank you for coming back to see us! You may sit at the tables if you are having drinks & appetizers :) We prefer to save the tables for folks who would like to eat, otherwise we would lose a ton more business via no where for our dinner guests to sit down & enjoy their meals. All we ask if that you have food as well! Please let our hosts know that you will be ordering food & they will gladly set you up with a table! Any issues & you can ask for me, Christina (I‚Äôm their general manager) Hope to see you soon!

Thanks,

Stopped by with some friends on a Thursday evening. The outdoor seating is first come first serve with about 8 tables, two underneath a tent. It was very crowded and hard to keep your distance from others. You can also walk inside and order takeout from the bar. While a majority of the tables are on Stone Street, there were a few tables on the other end of the restaurant where you can sit after ordering takeout. It was much quieter and we felt safer to eat here. Food was average Mexican food; nothing special. Our pitcher of margarita was very strong and well worth it!

So I didn't have the best experience at the location in midtown, but decided to give this location a try with a couple of friends as it was across the street from a cocktail bar.

I ordered the mushroom quesadilla because the other location is known to have excellent mushrooms and flavor however this one used canned mushrooms and did not have any flavor. They did take it off the bill so I do appreciate that.

My husband got the chile relenos & did not like it much. Lacked flavor and texture.

Our friends got the cheese chimichanga - they were good. Smaller app portion but good enough to be full and not have to take home leftovers or waste it.

For apps, we got nachos & corn which were good.

Not the best Mexican food I've had, but does have a fun vibe & indoor decor as well as music & margs.

But we're glad to hear you enjoyed the chimichangas, nachos and grilled corn! I will forward the feedback to our kitchen. We hope you'll give us another chance in the future and maybe try something different on the menu!

Seriously just the best I've been obsessed with this place for years. The marg towers are my absolute favorite. The food is really good too my personal favorite things on the menu are the guac and the wings. They have plastic straws which we LOVE. Also great coronavirus to go service.

I am a big fan.  Located near Wall Street downtown, historic area of Manhattan called Stone Street - full of outdoor seating, original brick - or maybe stone?  LOL  this street has the vibe of old New York, and that is enough for me.  However it is packed like sardines down here!  There are like 15 restaurants, bars etc you can choose from.  I get into Mexican food always, so this is a natural choice for me.  Street Corn is a NO, I found it soggy and over dressed with cheese. I much prefer my favorite place on Elizabeth street, but that is for another conversation.  Steak tacos were dry but acceptable.  Guacamole is super fantastic!  Service is Tremendous, which I appreciate on a hot summer day sitting outside hungry and thirsty.  Food is reasonably tasty, it is acceptable considering the location and ambiance/  Wonderful tequila options (let's get the priorities straight right?). This is a solid choice.

I always want to like this place but every single time they drop the ball. The food is always 3/10. Let me also add that they charged us $4 for a spicy rim on our spicy margarita - not to mention he didn't even tell us it was and extra charge? Ruben could have done better. Come here if you're drunk and can't taste anything I guess.

3/13/2020Hi Alexis! We‚Äôre sorry to hear the food you ordered didn‚Äôt live up to your expectations. Did you express the concerns with your server? We are of course always happy to switch out your dish for something else that you might like better! And yes we do charge $2 extra to add a flavor to your drink ‚Äî not $4. You ordered two drinks with extra added flavor, so it was $2 per drink, which comes out to $4 total for 2 drinks. Our Spicy Marg has fresh serrano pepper pur√©e added to it, which is what we charge extra for. We appreciate your feedback and please feel free to reach out if there is anything else you thought we could‚Äôve done better. Thank you!

My coworker made reservations for a 12:30pm group lunch and I'm so glad she did! When we arrived, we were escorted to the 2nd floor. About 30 minutes after we sat down, it was packed. Completely packed.

We ordered guac and chips for the table to share as well as Mexican grilled corn. Both were really good.

I had the steak quesadilla and it is such a large portion. I definitely did not finish it.

We also had a pitcher of their pickly pear margarita, which was really good. Highly recommend!!

Service was attentive and friendly - despite the fact that there was another large group on the 2nd floor. We never felt ignored or neglected.

Headed here on a Wednesday night to take advantage of the nice weather and plethora of restaurants offering outside seating. Mad Dog is the only Mexican offering in the area, so quickly went over and got a table for two at one of the long table-benches.

While looking through the menu, didn't see any happy hour deals, nor any free chips and salsa to start (Downtown Manhattan woes). Instead, settled on the Blackberry Margarita ($14) and the Pineapple Avocado Salad ($13). More expensive than one would like, though most restaurants are around that price point. Drinks come first - the margarita is a frozen ensemble of tequila and artificial fruit juice. Could have been a better flavor to balance out the tequila. As for the salad, the grilled pineapple is a nice treat, and the accompanying sauce made the mix of greens more palatable.

Service here is actually really good despite the servers having to work the indoor and outdoor crowds. Not a place I'd try often due to the prices - fine enough for a drink to end the night.

Mad Dog is a great spot located in FiDi with the perfect happy hour menu. I haven't had a chance to try the food here yet, but the frozen margaritas are super good! The service here is pretty good and the bartenders make the best drinks here.

I heard they have a massive margarita tower here, which I'll definitely be trying when I have more friends with me!

I'll be back again soon!

Ehh I can take it or leave it. I came in with a few friends on a Saturday night. It wasn't packed, but we couldn't immediately get a table so we sat at the bar. It took a while to get the bartenders attention, but the first round of drinks were solid--I really enjoyed the blackberry margarita, and they seemed to enjoy their sangrias. I wasn't as impressed with the sickly sweet mango margarita I tried next and would've stuck with one of their more unique margs next time.

Unfortunately when we tried to get the bartenders attention to order food and another round, it took almost half an hour and two separate requests from us asking the other bartender to get her to swing by.  It didn't seem PACKED, so not sure what was going on down there. We skipped dinner, but might be convinced to come back if we can get a table with more dedicated service.

Great spot with the best guacamole! This place does get crazy after 530/6 when ppl get outta work.

Got the steak tacos, guac, and marg. The guacamole wasn't made at the table which is sad but was amazing and fresh.

The margs were small but they're known for them. Def have to give them a try

Absolutely worth every penny. I've been here numerous times & always wanted to try out the Margarita Tower. *Let me be clear that the tower is sold to a party of 4 or more*  .. this tower is worth the price! It is priced at $115 and it can not be frozen nor if you ask for it without any ice, you'll get more fluid. We ordered the Guava Margarita, which is my new fav I think everywhere I go now. It's strong. Each person can take down 3 to 4 1/2 depending how it already has you feeling. If you thinking about it, give it a try at least once!

I've been wanting to try this spot out for some time already. I work near by & I've heard many good news of this location. Let's start off with those delicious corn on the cob pictures that others have posted. I have to admit I've never tried it but on this evening, I swear it was the best dish on the table. I also tried the shrimp tacos, dish comes with 3 small soft shell & a small order of yellow rice & black beans. I came with friends so we doubled up on the guacamole, which is made fresh, great portion & very well seasoned. We were seated upstairs for dinner, with our own bar.  The food came out at a decent time being that it was a packed evening. The location is well spaced out, downstairs seems to be more active by the music & limited seating. The drinks, oh that Sex on the Beach was so good. We each had 4 @ $10 cost each, they were strong & kicked in quick. The service was great, our waitress was attentive & friendly she was quick with getting our drinks. Inside decor is cute with a 'Dias de los Muertos' decor theme. The pop of color went well with the restaurant. I spent all weekend thinking of that corn on the cob! But we'll back soon for more drinks!

I like the happy hour deals that they offer at Mad Dog. Came with a group of colleagues midway for a conference nearby at FiDi. We each got a margarita - I got the coconut margarita. I really like the coconut taste to my margarita, and boy the $7 per margarita special was definitely good. The drink itself was a little bit acidic from what I would expect for a coconut margarita.

Service was rather mediocre IMO, the hostess wasn't really helpful in terms of explaining where we can sit to enjoy these happy hour delights. We had to ask a few waitresses and the bartender to figure out the happy hour was only restricted to the bar section.

Overall? Great happy hour selections. Drinks were a tad bit acidic for my taste, but I guess thats what you get for margaritas. Would come back!

If you order beef burrito it is really steak. They don't tell u that. Be aware. Checks can only be split up to 6 times. Even for 19 people.

The burrito comes with all this extra sauce on both sides. Make sure you tell them sauce on the side if you don't want a wet ass burrito

Update: one of the sauces is hit ass hell again for a first timer no one told me that it comes with hot sauce on one side

Update 2; I'm still eating no cheese or lettuce in these burritos either just steak that should be ground beef rice and beans.... no worth the hype ...should have got a $2 pizza

Update to the update: Anything that says beef is really steak don't be fooled. She told us she could only split the checks to 6 but I guess she realized she gets more money making it individually ...Don't trust these people

After the waitress realize her tip would be bigger she Split every single tip up individually...interesting LIE

11/24/2019Hi Deprina! Thanks for the feedback, and we‚Äôre sorry about the confusion. The word ‚ÄùBeef‚Äù actually just means meat from a cow. ‚ÄùBeef steak‚Äù and ‚Äùground beef‚Äù are two different types of preparations of beef. It doesn‚Äôt say anywhere on the menu that the burrito has GROUND beef in it, it just says beef. Which in our case means beef steak. We always recommend asking your server for details if you are wondering about how things are prepared! And the reason we can‚Äôt split up a bill 19 ways is because it would take too long and slow down service for the rest of our guests!

The only reason this place is still in business is because of the stone street environment. If you are looking for Delicious Mexican than do not come here and do not order salsa. It's literally pico not salsa. So stupid.

The fajita is gross too. Adriennes down the street is so much better. Service was awful too.

Came here on a Thursday with a friend. Unfortunately missed happy hour but that didn't stop us from ordering some frozen margaritas. Not my first time here. The margs are great. Really have a great punch and refreshing at the same time. Asked for chips and salsa, which we were charged for. Idk, maybe it's just presumptive, but most Mexican restaurants give them complimentary. Oh well. It was tasty and worth it. Wanted to order the guacamole but I thought it was so over priced. If my memory serves me right about 14 dollars. Glad I passed because when I ordered my steak enchilada it included a serving of guacamole. The guacamole was great. The enchiladas was also very tasty. Service was good as well. Also ordered the churro with tres leche dip. Amazing. Served with blue berries and strawberries with a bit of powered sugar. Over all good eat. Can't go wrong

Came in for a quick drink and some snacks before my wife and I headed do a few things in the city . We sat at the bar luckily Nicole our bartender informed us that it was happy hour and suggested the guacamole. It was probably one of the best guacamole's we have ever had. Nicole was super friendly. Next time we are in  the financial district stopping here is a must.  Great guacamole and great staff. Side note strong margaritas.

Really missing mad dog I was really hoping to get back there when the weather got nice again but ever since COVID-19 I can't but upon reopening whenever that happens we will certainly make our way back . I've been craving that Guacamole ! Could go for some right now..

Found this place while walking along Stone St. Decided to stop on in because we saw a table with the beer tube of margaritas. There was only 3 of us so we opted to get a fishbowl. I'm not a fan of frozen margs and they were able to give it to us on the rocks even though it wasn't on the menu. It was super super strong, too. Had to keep pouring water into it to drown the OVERWHELMING tequila taste.

The food is good. We got an order of mild guacamole for the table. It's more on the lumpy side. I ordered the steak tacos which come 4 tacos and a small side of rice and beans. Surprisingly filling despite their small portion.

My biggest gripe with this place is their speed. Takes forever to get a table, even if there are so many open and it takes a long time to get approached by our waiter/waitress. We were having good conversation which kept the time going, but we definitely noticed how long it was taking.

Came here on a Monday night and service was great. Tables are set up outside and there is no indoor eating at the moment due to Covid 19. The margaritas are still amazing and the food service was pretty fast. Our waitress was pretty awesome and checked on us frequently. They didn't have a highchair for outdoor use for my child, but we still managed to enjoy ourselves.  The nacho sampler was so tasty, and the hot wings are super spicy and flavorful.

Yum!!!! I'm a fan. Drinks were delish and so were the entrees.

We ordered:
- pitcher of classic margarita - enough for 6-7 glasses of marg
- guac to share never a bad idea
- 2 Tampique√±a steaks ($22 chargrilled skirt steak) - AMAZING, so flavorful, well seasoned, and honestly just really hit the spot
- chicken burrito bowl - which I wasn't SO crazy about just because it was a bit heavy with all the rice we already had at our table, wouldn't order this again

Very reasonable prices, generous portions, and great food! Will return :)

Loved this place!!!
We were a group of 10 Ladies and as soon as we arrived they prepared tables and seated us within seconds.

Loved the attention from our waitress.
Loved the fast service of the kitchen.
Loved the decoration!!

But specially, I really really Loved the ambiance.
We were seated right in the middle, on the second floor, surrounded by other tables and some other groups. Loved how festive it felt. They were playing awesome Latin music, we were celebrating a birthday and my farewell.

We ordered many appetizers to share among the group. Everything was exquisite. The guacamole was my favorite over all the others. It was perfectly made, not salty but flavorful, not too spicy but it had something that felt spicy and tasteful at the same time. Guac was also acid enough for you to LOVE it.

We had two or three Margarita Towers to share, they are very tricky. A mixture of sweet but really strong, so be careful. :p

I am really really really looking forward to come back soon.

I came here with boyfriend for dinner the other night. It was surprisingly crowded for a weeknight, but we were seated right away. Like most of the bars on Stone Street, it was pretty loud, but we didn't really mind.

We each got fajitas, he got steak and I got chicken. It was a decent amount of food - I brought half of mine home for leftovers. They bring you the typical sides: guac, tomatoes, etc. I'd say for the amount of food you get the price isn't outrageous. Good spot for groups, but not a good date spot.

Pretty average Mexican food. Prices were fair, flavor was mediocre, and service was fine. You basically go here for the Stone Street ambience- come with a group and sit outside on the picnic style tables and have a good time. Margarita towers were alright and are more for show.

Came here for a friends birthday party with a group of approx 15 ppl, had a reservation and got this little corner with a table and approx 6 seats??
It's appropriate to say it was uncomfortable for people to just stand or sit or where to put my drink and food??
On to the food we got Guac and chips which was $25 for double had legit no flavor. The chips were freshly made they were still warm when it was served. For drink I got elderflower cocktail, it was described as fruity floral but legit reaked of mezcal, which I being a picky drinker didn't enjoy. My friend had passion fruit margarita which was more palatable.

Overall nothing to write home about as you can tell by the overall rating of this place. I have been to pretty solid places serving Mexican style fare. And this one is not to be bothered with.

Love this spot! The margs are always good along with the chips and guac. I got the chicken chimichanga and shrimp tacos and they were really good too. It's just really hard to get a table outside and service can be slow when it's very busy. But overall this is the best spot on stone street and I always look forward to coming back!

Visited with a few friends after getting our drink on at happy hour.

The food was pretty good. I had the plantains and the corn, both delicious. The queso dip was just OK and could have been alot bigger.
I had nibbles of everyone else's meal(s) tacos and such- all seemed to be good.

The service was great, our waiter was extremely attentive and made our collective experience more enjoyable.

The main issue I had was the margarita tower- It was filled with SO much ice that I didn't really feel like it was worth the price. I also felt as though the glasses they were suppose to be served in were quite small. I'd recommend skipping the tower.

While this place isnt the most expensive, its also not the cheapest. I don't know if I will make the effort to come down to FIDI to try this place again, but its not bad by any means.

Side note, the back patio/alleyway is cute perfection.

4/5

8/20/2019Hi Sarah! Thanks so much for the detailed review!! We are so glad to hear you thought the food was good and that the corn and plantains were especially delicious :) Our 100oz Margarita Tower is priced at $115 and fills 10 glasses, so it comes out to $11.50 per margarita! Our regular House Margarita is priced $13, so we actually think it's a pretty good discount. We hope to see you again next time you're in the neighborhood!

Delicious bread! We tried the buckwheat baguette last night and ate the whole thing in one sitting! Nutty and delicious. We highly recommend. The croissants are also amazing. Almost like Paris. They are open during this pandemic - support local business and get amazing bread!

What an adorable little spot! Not even sure where to begin, the food the wait staff, the ambiance and the experience was all 5 star quality. Julio, the manager gives great service and will leave you feeling full and even a little tipsy!

The food menu  is well rounded and adaptable to food allergies. The lumache is so amazing- a vegan option that would be unrecognizable to someone who eats dairy. The pastas are all made in house which makes them so fresh.

Dessert- get the cake with the chocolate gnash (spelling?) you will for sure want to drink it up with a straw.

Overall a great dining experience and would recommend to anyone!!!

I trekked 25 minutes by foot specifically to try Runner & Stone's almond croissant, after reading the myriad of glowing reviews about this particular item. Forking over $4 for the somewhat smaller-than-expected pastry, I had high expectations. I would say that it met, but did not exceed, my expectations. The almond croissant was very flaky, but overall I found it to be overbaked and somewhat dense. The almond paste, however, in the middle is a thing of beauty. I appreciated that it was rich and abundant, but not too sweet or cloying. I probably wouldn't seek it out again since I found the outer layer too crusty, but I enjoyed it for what it was worth.

Really disappointed by the size to price ratio of their pre-made sandwiches today. I purchased an egg salad sandwich that measured roughly 3""x3, which cost $12 but probably had 1 tablespoon's worth of egg salad in each half, and was mostly pickled red onion. I'm not in the business of complaining, but I work in the industry myself and have standards and expectations. I've enjoyed your sandwiches in the past and felt their were worth the cost, but definitely not today. Either lower the price of the egg sandwich, or actually make it worth $12.

I came here for brunch during my lunch hour. The service here was really fast:  getting seated, ordering, and my food coming out happened in a 15-20 minute window.

I ordered the french toast with a side of bacon. The french toast had an amazing marmalade on top of it. That marmalade with the very savory syrup was a perfect blend. I was tempted to order another french toast to go. The bacon was good and had a nice crunch to it. I expected to get a bigger portion of bacon for the price.

The restaurant seems small but I didn't venture past the bar seating. All of the pastries displayed had a nice presentation and I will definitely be back to try them out or maybe just go for french toast.

We had a private event, around 12 people for a baby shower there for a Saturday Brunch.  We were able to utilize a private room area downstairs that was the perfect size (can fit a few more) for our crowd.  Julio was very easy to work with in organizing the event.  The staff, including Emily, was very helpful and accommodating the day of the event.  All of their food was delicious, the fried chicken being a crowd favorite!
Pricing is reasonable, especially considering what many places in NYC ask for / require in spending.  Definitely recommend this restaurant, especially for an event!

The Gowanus neighborhood in Brooklyn has many resident's, and no real bakery. Runner and Stone is the only place in the nabe where one can purchase a loaf of bread, and pastries. If you own a vehicle make a trip elsewhere. To begin, staff and patrons are not adhering to social distancing rules, and nobody is wearing a mask. Bread is tough and tasteless, and pastries aren't any better. Their prices are higher than average for Brooklyn, but there appears to be no shortage of money in this neighborhood. 3rd Avenue monopoly.

I dislike posting negative review's, but i feel obligated to post one of Runner & Stone. I dined there recently along with a friend, and was disappointed, to say the least. Runner & Stone is a tiny restaurant located in the Gowanus section of Brooklyn. I went in with high expectation's, after hearing good thing's from a dear friend. My dinner was less than spectacular. I started with a glass of Chianti, A tiny glass of insipid wine for $15. My guest ordered a Martini. Three sip's and the glass was empty, cost $19. We ordered Duck Prosciutto as our app, it was tough and tasteless .Entree's weren't any better. Squid ink Bucatini was overcooked, contained only a tiny bit of Crab and Lobster, and the dish was drowning in Butter. My Orecchiete was overcooked, and full  of Pork fat.  When I complained to the manager, Julio, he shrugged his shoulder's and replied ""I can't please everybody"". I guess I won't be returning.

Stopped by for pastries because I had tried the anise fig bread a while back and loved it. I've seen the bad reviews in regards to service and thought, how bad could it be for ordering at the counter? While it wasn't terrible, the worker was obviously dreaming of the end of her shift because me and my sister requested the buckwheat bread TWICE and when we got home we realized that we were charged for it and there was no sign of the bread. Not to mention that we were told they were out of the anise bread and I pointed to a loaf in front of the worker and she was surprised and acknowledged that it was indeed anise.

I've been overcharged at other bakeries before and tire of it when there's no excuse of the place being packed or there being a long and complicated order. None of that here. Moral is either to shop elsewhere or CHECK YOUR BAG BEFORE leaving the place.

Excellent! I Roth going to just for a loaf of bread or a pastry. The ham and cheese croissant is delicious, and they have a stand at the farmer's market on sundays. They're sit down food is also delicious. Great for brunch, afternoon hangs, or a date night dinner.

I'm just going to go out on a limb and say this place is probably best for breakfast and lunch, but not for dinner. Our Saturday night meal was pretty tasty and the service was very good. But not so memorable that I can recall what exactly we ate (it was pasta for me). It just didn't knock my socks off. And the portions - particularly for the appetizers - were very small. Surprisingly we didn't care for dessert either - it was some type of rye pudding. Another dessert had booze in it and the one non-drinker at our table seemed to get it all in one bite. That said, I will gladly say that Runner and Stone has delicious baked goods and I love their chocolate croissant. And if you can get their Christmas stollen during the holidays, it is out of this world. I just don't think I'll be back for dinner.

My second time here and both times had such a bad experience with the services. People at the counter are so rude that we eventually decided to leave everything and run out.
We used to buy their pretzels and bread at the park slope farmers market for years and decided to come to the bakery to try it out. The first time we came in, the staff was quite rude, but people have bad days so we decided to give it another chance today. Today was even worse so this will be our last time here. I'm not coming back again.

TLDR: Nice relaxed bi-level space with great food and even better pastries/breads. I definitely look forward to returning! Overall rating: A+

I made an easy reservation through Yelp. My friend and I were seated right away on a Monday night though arriving 10 minutes early. Its a casual, friendly place. I was pleasantly surprised by the comfortable spacing between tables, low noise level, and good amount of light. The service was wonderful! It was prompt but they didn't make you feel rushed! Clean bathrooms. Now into the good stuff, the food!

-Complimentary amuse bouche: Small square of flaky bread like a extra crunchy croissant with olive pieces. A

-Complimentary bread assortment: Buckwheat Baguette, Bolzano Miche, and a third unknown bread with house-made butter. I've never had such flavorful bread and that homemade butter just put it over the top! A+

-Duck Pastrami appetizer with beer mustard, pickled onions, rye bread: My favorite appetizer of the night! Fatty and juicy, paired well with the accompaniments! Smaller portion though. Only 5 pieces total I believe. A+

-House cured chorizo with pink flavored goat cheese, pickled ramps, and served with bread: This was a special of the day. While decent, not as good as the pastrami. Not spicy, kind of oily for me. Even smaller portion than the duck but more expensive too. I'd pass on this. B+

-Carrot Lumache pasta with rabbit ragu, spring peas, rosemary: I got the small/appetizer size. So good! Lonely housemade pasta. It was a really flavorful and light spring dish! I wish I got this as the bigger entree portion! A++

-Semolina Gnocchi with caramelized onion, mushrooms, red cabbage, pistachio pecorino: I got the small/appetizer size of this as well. I wasn't really a fan of this dish. It was very heavy for a vegetarian dish! The homemade gnocchi was too al dente. Worst of all it was lacking in the flavor department. I didn't really taste the caramelized onion or pistachio. Pass! C

-Squid Ink Bucatini with lobster, crab, pepperocino, herbs, chilies: My friend got this as the entree size. The pasta is in the shape of long straws. It was interesting since I never tried squid ink pastas before. It's very fishy though. Probably due to it being topped with seafood. Also garnished with crunchy breadcrumbs. So if you don't enjoy the taste of the ocean then skip this. Since I'm not a fan of fishy things, I'd hard pass on this! C-

-Coffee Panna Cotta with whipped cream and cacao nibs: It was served with chocolate shortbread on the side. This was excellent! Lots of delicious coffee flavor and not too sweet. I appreciated the contrasting textures between the soft, custardy panna cotta vs the crunchy cacao nibs and shortbread. A

-Croissant, $2.50: I asked our server to set aside a croissant for me since I heard such great things about them! It didn't disappoint even after 7pm! A+

Pro Tip: Half price bottle of any wines during Monday and Tuesday dinner! We got the Terre Di Marca Prosecco. Normally $42, but we got it for $21. Really great deal when a glass of the same prosecco is $11 each!

Everything came out to about $130 after tax (not including tip yet). Not bad for 2 appetizers, the equivalent of 2 entrees, 1 dessert, 1 pastry, and 1 bottle of wine. Only thing I didn't love was the industrial/empty streets of this neighborhood (Gowanus). I still felt comfortable walking around though. This would be a special occasion place for me. Looking forward to my next visit. Hopefully, when their menu rotates with the season!

Hands down, best almond chocolate croissant that I've had in New York City and the only croissant that stands up to the ones at b. Patisserie in San Francisco. The almond filling is thick, wonderfully textural, and not too sweet. The filling also subtly tastes like egg pudding, which I love.

Even their plain croissant is sooo flaky and melts in your mouth as you chew. They also have a unique einkorn croissant, which is like a whole wheat croissant that has a more wholesome, grainy taste. It would be perfect to make an egg sandwich with or to enjoy with some jam.

Besides being a bakery that has croissants you can't get anywhere else, Runner & Stone is a full restaurant plus bar. They manage to maintain a very relaxed and welcoming vibe in their chic, modern space.

For dinner, their roasted beet salad had a unique cumin dressing that was warming and satisfying. It was a nice way to start the meal and I'd order it again. I usually don't like gnocchi because I find it can get mushy very easily, but theirs had a nice chew to it. Plus it was generously topped with... pistachio pecorino. So good.

The cherry on top was the excellent, down-to-earth service. It really makes it feel like a go-to, neighborhood spot. Can't wait to go back again!

Delightful lunch with my son. It's a quiet little spot. The lunch menu is small but the selections are varied and will satisfy any palate. They have home made potato chips that are yummy.  Looks like they have a nice wine selection although I don't know if they have a happy hour.

I LOVED IT HERE.
Super chill vibe that was filled with kindness.
Loved the decor.
Came around 11am on a Sunday. Plenty of seats available. Our server/host was perfection. She was so calm and smooth. It just made you feel good and that you were in the right place. (Hey. I know. It was Brunch. Like relax, Molly. It isn't that serious. But man, I realllllly liked the vibe.)

I will be back to experience the dinner menu.

Oh, I must also mention the selection of treats from the the bakery displayed in the front. We grabbed a few before we left.
The guy managing that section was super kind and funny. The treats were out of this world. Cheers to this team!

Wow, I adore this place. I had the great fortune to come here with some professors who have made this their spot for special dinners and so we got treated like royalty. But I have no doubt Runner & Stone is consistently the bomb dot com when it comes to service.

First off, the liquor and wine selection here is impeccable - local gin, orange sparkling wine, a whiskey sour that perfectly hit the spot, etc. Then, the unbelievable food. We opened with these crunchy olive baklava type bites and then some of the most savory and flavorful bread I've ever had. We had some of their specials (the potato and ham croquettes were unbelievable), as well as some of their First dishes (the beet salad was very, very good). Then the entr√©es: oh my GOSH that fried chicken is so good, on a bed of tart slaw. And finally, the mindblowing desserts: I had the elderflower creme br√ªl√©e with black currant jam and buckwheat shortbread and my word, did they do that creme br√ªl√©e justice with the perfect caramelized layer and the sweet sweet jam underneath. The staff was helpful and offered personalized suggestions to guide our decision-making.

They sent us on our way with loaves of bread (so psyched to try this stout cheddar bread) and bellies full of warmth and good food. Needless to say, if you want a truly satisfying dining experience, which features all of the little things I mentioned, Runner & Stone is the place for it.

Went for dinner .
Atmosphere 5 stars
Food 4 stars
Service 5 stars

Husband loved the fish ( I felt it was slightly underdone )
Kids loved loved loved the brown butter gnocchi
I enjoyed the fried chicken ( didnt think it was the best I had tasted but still a good rendition of fried chicken with crispy skin, moist meat. It just fell short on the seasoning department. Wasn't the best seasoning mix I'd tasted.
They had yummy bread  and butter- they better ! They are also a bakery / restaurant with a stellar cast of freshly baked pretzels, croissants, bread etc
I plan to return one morning to gorge myself silly on their baked goods.

I ordered the fish sandwich and it was amazing! The soup of day was a potato soup even better. I had a great meat and can't wait to eat there again.

Don't miss out on this phenomenal eatery. Julio was a perfect host. From the moment we arrived, we were treated like royalty. Given extra little nibbles and spot on wine suggestions. Every plate was meticulously created and artistically plated. Delicious does not suffice to describe the food and my experience. Thank you so much!

Amazing restaurant. I love their home made baked goods - especially the pretzels. They are even better than the original ""Laugenbrezen"" from Germany. Also the food is delicious - great place for brunch.

Everything is delicious. Yelp wants me to write some big ass long review but all I can say is everything is amazing. Get an almond croissant and think of me please.

I keep going back and I continue to be impressed! This time we took my brother, mother and father in law and they all agreed. The spaghetti with duck ragu was delicious, the fried chicken was better than blue ribbon and the chicken liver pate was excellent. Plus, the service is amazing - Julio has been legendary every time we've visited.

I went here with my wife on a Friday night. We had reservations for 8pm and we were sat straight away next to the front windows. The service was prompt and friendly, we had the crostini app with mushrooms, ricotta and truffle oil. It was delicious. We ordered pasta as our mains having heard of how good the bread and homemade pasta was. We shared the squid ink pasta and the ragu. I'm happy to say it was some of the best pasta I've had in NYC, all boroughs included. We will be back many, many times!

Had a good time here with family.

Tried the
duck pastrami-best duck I've had!
baby iceberg salad-pretty good
grilled porkchop-very nice flavor and quite tender

One of our party had the fish of the day which was a black bass that she really enjoyed as well.

The service was really good and prompt.  Only thing was, at the end of the night I asked for a whiskey listing and indicated I might want scotch but ordered a bourbon instead and the waitress made a huge deal about how that's not scotch...like yea, i know...chill.

Overall, good meal but really expensive and I wasn't that into the vibe of the place.  (this is personal not a ""fact"" of the place)  I just didn't feel like it was worth the money to me.  Probably won't be back but would definitely recommend it to others.

What a lovely place. Went with a group for dinner and couldn't have been more welcomed by the owner. The Squid Ink Bucatini with Lobster was worth wanting as an appetizer, entree and the dessert. I didn't just want more... I needed more! The ice cream selection was yummy with the Sour Cream being my favorite. Next time I'm in Brooklyn, I'm definitely coming back!

For a place that's a bakery first and a restaurant second...this is a damn fine restaurant.

I'm not sure if they are simply the nicest folks around or if the waitress was desperately in love with me,* but they started us off with fantastic mini-croissants, and when we were leaving they sent the two couples at our table our way with a loaf of excellent bread each (again, bakery first).

In between, we indulged in fried chicken, strip steaks, amazing pastas, chicken liver pate, and much more. I'm not going to complain about any of it. The wine list, while short and sweet, is surprisingly on point as well. We aren't winos...wait, we are winos. We aren't wine SNOBS, but we definitely found their curated selections to be delicious.

Personally, I've cooked and I've baked, and baking is more difficult. It's not surprising that the talented bakers here can also cook delicious things. See you again soon.

*I lied. It's definitely the former.

Step 1: Cut a hole in a box.
Step 2. Order some palmiers.

I forgot what I was talking about, but seriously, the palmiers (you may know them as elephant ears) are fantastic. And really, all the baked goods from breads to pastries are outstanding. Get some of them.

I've been to Runner & Stone on several occasions, and from what I can tell, they are serving quality food in a cozy little atmosphere. It's an excellent place to hold a business meeting over a few shared snacks, or to have a nice sit-down lunch. If you're there for the former, palmiers are a must (I can't stress this enough because I really do enjoy butter), and for the latter, I really like the braised chicken sandwich.

If I had any criticisms, they are:

1. It's almost impossible to read the specials at the wrong time of day, thanks to a combination of handwriting and them being written on a mirror reflecting blinding light into your eyes. (And I really wanted to know about that corned beef sandwich, because it was good.)

2. The service is a bit awkward. Not because of the staff, they are all complete sweethearts. Rather, because it's very unclear how you're supposed to proceed when you want food and/or beverages because there is an odd combination of table service/counter service. So let me help you:

Even if you're the only one in the space, you have to go up to the counter (which could be five feet away) to order, and to pay when you're done. If you want water though, there's a little station where you can serve yourself. Your food will be brought to you, but silverware is up at the station as well, unless you want spoons...then I think you have to ask.

I feel the need to answer these questions because I watched every customer ask them; perhaps a sign (or a system change) is in order. I haven't been for dinner yet, so I think you're on your own there.

I came here for dinner on a Monday night.  The place is larger than you would expect from looking at the outside.  We ordered the duck pastrami and the large orecchiette with pork sausage and broccoli raven.  The bread basket was really good since they bake their own bread so the bread is fresh.  The duck pastrami was interesting - making your own pastrami sandwich with duck breast instead of pastrami.  The duck was not warm though.  I wish it wasn't so cold.  The orecchiette was tasty and the sausage was juicy.  I would come back to try their brunch.

What are you doing right now? Nothing you say? I think you should run over to runner and stone! (Haha cheesy I know, but true)

I love runner and stone. It is the cutest little place for great coffee/tea as well as a good meal. The staff are all very nice and welcoming and the atmosphere is very Sunday afternoon everyday of the week.

My absolute fave thing to have here is the chamomile tea and the ham and cheese croissant. It is the best ham and cheese I've had. If you are going in hopes to try the ham and cheese croissant it's best to go as early as possible because they do sell out fast. I've taken many walks over to find they were sold out. They put the perfect amount of ham and cheese inside and the outside is topped with seeds and flavor almost the same tastes you would get on top of an everything bagel but more subtle.

The soft pretzels here are also very good they are nice and soft.

If you are ever looking for a good breakfast or brunch spot this is the perfect place to go.

This was my first visit to Runner & Stone. It was a Sunday at 12:15pm.  After a hearty welcome by the staff, I took a seat at the empty counter although all tables were occupied and there was a wait in the small confines. Strategically placed mirrors make it appear as a larger space than it really is. I ordered the Chef's Omelette for my brunch item which came with potatoes. I enjoyed my meal while listening to music that was drowned out by patron chatter. For $17, the meal was limited in quantity plus I've tasted much better. As a runner, I was hoping for more from those with Runner in the name.

Been here twice after work meetings.  I had the duck pastrami salad (delicious) and a latte (fantastic).  The server, who I have seen twice, was extremely personable and attentive.  While this experience was nice and all, I need to mention the best part: the baked goods.  I bought a hot cross bun to take on the road and goddamn it was good!  It was the best one I have ever had.  I plan on going back just to try more from the bakery.

First I will say that the food was very good and our waiter, Jeremy, was top-notch. That said, we won't be going back due to our interaction with the Host, Julio, which left us with a bad taste in our mouths (pun intended). With so many other restaurants to choose from, I will go to one that acts like it wants me as a customer. Here is what happened:

Our party of 4 arrived for our reservation and Julio said he had a table for us downstairs.

We asked to be seated upstairs at an open 4-top.  He told us no because he was keeping it for a  party of 6.

Julio led us to the charmless basement that at one point filled with not so pleasant cooking aromas from the kitchen below.

The table he gave us was so close to another table on one side that we couldn't get into our seats.

We asked to push it back as there was 5-6 ft of empty space on the other side. The request was not greeted with enthusiasm and he said couldn't push it too close to a door marked ""employees only"".  He moved it a fraction.  We had to move it more ourselves so we could sit down and be comfortable.  During the evening one employee did use that door a few times -- he carefully opened and closed and seemed quite fine doing so.

All of this was annoying, but what pushed us over the edge was that we could see the table we asked for and it stayed empty for the first hour of our meal, and then was filled with a party of 4.

We got the message.  We won't be back, but we do thank Jeremy for his sense of humor and his excellent food recommendations.

I came here on a whim just to kill time while waiting to meet up with a friend. I've read a lot about their pastries so I grabbed a table and ordered their almond croissant and a cup of cappuccino. The almond croissant was probably one of the best almond croissants I've had in a very long time! It was really crunchy with lots of almond flavor in the filling. This is what almond croissants should be...both flaky and crunchy at the same time. Their cappuccino was also spot on. While most people around me were ordering brunch meals, I was pretty content with just my croissant and coffee. The people here were really nice and didn't rush me especially since I had a table all to myself. I would definitely come back again and try either their brunch or dinner.

We were a party of 6, went for dinner on a Thursday at 7, made reservations in advance. They had our table ready when we walked in, and we were seated immediately. (score 1 for Runner & Stone for knowing both how to take the reservation AND honor the reservation!) Service was great ... friendly and attentive. I ordered a glass of wine, and our server brought the bottle and gave me a taste before pouring. Nice.

We'd heard about the bread. And yeah, the bread is fantastic, and the butter is cultured in-house!

From there, we shared a few apps - all were great -  and moved onto the entrees. Actually, to cut to the chase, all the food from apps to dessert was prepared well and quite delicious. We had a wonderful tiome here and highly recommend.

They gave us some chocolate croissants to take home for next-day breakfast as we were leaving. OMG best I've ever had! We shall return!

Amazing service, the food was perfect. We even got an amuse bouche that wasn't part of our order and went to a birthday after that we didn't even need to get drinks at because we were so stuffed and pleasantly satisfied by our drinks at this restaurant. Perfect for an anniversary dinner, date night, or just a good spot where you can hear each other for dinner with friends!

Super friendly staff as well

Had a great birthday dinner at Celestine unfortunately due to the pandemic the back doors had to be left open which bought in all the cold air coming off the river into the restaurant where we sat; making it extremely cold and uncomfortable  . I would highly recommend that they invest in space hater for winter . Other than that our meal was delicious . We had the hummus , Pasta, Beef Brisket Burger, baked chicken with the feta cheese rice, cauliflower  and seafood appetizer . All fresh tasting, filled with flavor and cooked to perfection .

Celestine is situated in a beautiful location with waterfront views of the East River and that of the Brooklyn Bridge.

In this day and age, the only time that I seem to visit any restaurant is due to a birthday celebration and this time was no different. Parking surprisingly wasn't that hard to come by. It could've had something to do with the time we went there, it was closer to closing, but they were still allowing people to come in.

When you get into the restaurant setting, you're directed to their patio like area that's literally a stones throw away from the water...if you have a good arm. They practice social distancing and offer you hand sanitizer both upon entry and at your table of choice. You're allowed to remove your mask once you're seated with your party and can eat in what I would consider, pre Corona normalcy.

The food didn't take too long to come, we ordered the House-made Za'atar Flatbread with Hummus for two, The One and Another One both with fries. I must say though, for a place that portrays itself as a Mediterranean style restaurant, they have some interesting names for their meals. I liked it though. It was kinda a nice play on words. Since this was my first time visiting this restaurant, I'm not sure if this was the updated menu due to Corona, but either way it created a relaxing feel and I honestly didn't feel as if I was eating at a Mediterranean restaurant.

When our orders came, it was wrapped in wrapping paper and aluminum foil. Sorta like a gift of some sort. The burgers were a huuuge disappointment for me. For what we paid, we certainly don't get what we paid for. The burger looked like something I could've made and even then it would've came out better. The lettuce was like the cheapest one you could get and it was so bulky that it overpowered the taste of the whole burger. I had to take it all out, because it made it feel like a cheap burger and it added nothing to it. Even without the lettuce, the burger fell flat. I think it was my last time getting ""The One"" and I most certainly didn't want ""Another One"". Now the Hummus and the Flatbread and even the fries were the stars of the night. They were equally appetizing and that's a crazy thing to say about some fries.

The music and the atmosphere reminded me of a late night barbecue in someone's backyard. The music was relaxing and very chill. Overall it was a nice venue with some over-priced food.

I was very excited to make a reservation here. I have been here before about a year ago for brunch and the food was great. However, I called today to make a reservation, and the woman with who I was trying to make a reservation was extremely rude to me on the phone and told me I should book online. I went online and I had to ask a question so I called back the restaurant. The same woman picked up the phone on me and was even ruder than previously.  I was so upset over this that I did not want to further book anything at this restaurant. This really left a bad taste in my mouth!!!

Celestine is situated in one of the nicest locales I've ever seen. Nestled under the Manhattan bridge, Brooklyn bridge park and water view, the skyline of lower Manhattan across the way all lit up. It's gorgeous, and that's why you pay what you do for a good restaurant. Not great. The food is good.

Service was very friendly and probably even a touch quicker than one would expect for a restaurant of a similar price tag. Our server, Logan, was particularly nice and offered us recommendations on a bottle of orange wine. Not made of oranges, but subtly delicious.

Starters, sides, and mains are all in the photos. Pita was a standout - not served too hot but warm and very fluffy with a nice dusting of za'atar. Hummus was good enough - could have used a little more. Olives were more for my girlfriend who enjoyed them.

Spicy lamb manti were nice and sans the typical cream which is fine by me. Flat iron steak was cooked to a rare perfectly. Pennsylvania chicken was done right as well.

In short, the food didn't wow us, the service was great, and the locale is spectacular, and this results in a price tag that tip-toes the line of unpalatable. This is a solid 4.

You really do pay for the location. The restaurant is situated right under the Manhattan bridge. It's a romantic setting, dimly light and a water/bridge view.

The menu is definitely smaller than most. Definitely a simple take on Mediterranean food. We got the red snapper and hummus to start. They were good, but nothing spectacular that I would  come back for. For entrees, we got the steak, chicken and tuna. All were cooked and seasoned well. Again, all were pretty good, but really nothing amazing. For what it is, their menu is way overpriced.

The service was good, food was decent, but was definitely expecting more based on the price range and location. Disappointed.

This restaurant is incredible! Had my post wedding dinner here in June of 2019. The scenery, food and staff were beyond amazing. This was my first experience at Celestine (my original reservation at another spot fell through and I am so glad it did as it lead me here!) I cannot stress enough how delicious the food is. Everything was so fresh, seasoned and cooked to perfection. I really hope to return some day soon!

I have been going back for work lunches and a few dinners, and after the experience the past few months I think it's time to break up.

I've experienced nothing but slow service without any explanations, meals that I've had to send back, unfriendly hostesses, and some salty meals.

Food is generally really good- but the service since they opened has gone downhill.

This is a new place near my office - and a great option for a nicer dinner with the team or clients. First, the view is phenomenal, I could sit there with a bottle of wine and be happy.

I went with a few friends and we immediately went back a few days later, I want to try their brunch! We each had a cocktail and loved them. I can't recall the names.

We split a few dishes both times:
1). Baba Ganoush - 5/5 so yummy
2). Muhammara - 5/5 very yummy
3). Hummus - 5/5
4). Flat Bread - 5/5
5). Branzino - 5/5
6). Short Rib Dumpling - 5/5
7). Green Bean Salad - 4/5

Service was good, but the food was amazing.

The food here was served fast. I liked the artichoke in the hummus. It tasted a bit like it also had some sort of floral ingredient. The flatbread was served with the mezze. The kale salad was passable, as well as the lamb wrap. All the food here was okay. Also, the portions were a bit on the smaller side.
Overall, I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again, but it is a nice restaurant with a great view. Their brunch menu needs a little work. I feel it lacked entree options.

A very good friend of ours had made brunch reservations on a beautiful spring Saturday and we arrived 25 mins later than our reservation time and were nervous that we'd lose our table. At 12:25 pm on a Saturday, we were seated right away and the place was half full, with outdoor seating being almost full, where we wanted to sit.

The view from our outdoor seating was beautiful. The only problem which made us move inside within 5 minutes, was too much wind and too less sunlight which was making it a bit chilly for us. On a perfect warm summer day, I'd highly recommend outdoor seating!

We started with some brunch cocktails which included Gamma and Jupiter, priced at $15 each. Both cocktails were decent, not enough kick to them though.

For Mezze, we got the Hummus and Baba Ghannouj ($9 ea) which came with pita bread. The Hummus was absolutely delicious. For mains, we got Steamed Egg ($16) and Chicken Thigh Kebab ($16). Both were very delicious, but i wish the portions were slightly bigger as far as meat was concerned. If you eat bread, the Chicken Thigh Kebab will stuff you but for all non-bread eaters, I'd recommend getting that plate with salad replacements. The thigh kebab although very delicious, barely had small pieces of chicken in it.

We also ordered the French Toast Casserole ($12) for dessert and it was absolutely amazing. One for the table was the perfect amount of sweetness we needed for our sugar craving.

Service was excellent and it was a very friendly staff who welcomed and served us that day. Noise levels were low making it a perfect spot to have conversations with your friends. Will definitely recommend this place for brunch or a romantic date night!

Absolutely delicious and GORGEOUS spot in Dumbo! I chose this place for a client lunch, and I got such great feedback about the spot from everyone.

After taking a look at the menu and ensuring that there were gluten free options for one of the guests, my coworkers and I decided on this restaurant and made our way over at noon on a Tuesday. The restaurant was quite empty when we arrived but began to fill up later by those who were opting to dine later.

There are huge windows and a beautiful wraparound patio that display the views of the bridges and river. We were given a corner table in full view of the beautiful day and amazing service by the staff.

We ordered the hummus and yogurt dips which came with the best flatbread I have ever had. Everything was wonderfully prepared and seasoned, and I was excited to try the main dishes. We all ended up ordering variations of the two salads they had, but we were all pleasantly satisfied. The salads were made with the best ingredients and everything was absolutely delicious.

I definitely want to come back and try more of their options, everything looked absolutely delicious!

My friends took me here for my birthday dinner. The food was artfully prepared and tasted delicious. They have a fresh interesting take on a few Middle Eastern and Mediterranean fare. The mezze platter was soooo yummy and easy to share. The za'atar spiced pita that comes with it is so delicious and soft. I highly recommend the branzino. The prices are a bit high however the food is worth it and the ambience is incredible. The view of 3 Brooklyn-Manhattan bridges and the east river and skyline are so mesmerizing. One thing about some of the dishes that was too great was the level of acidity. The orzo and 2 different spreads had way too much sour lemon/acid that it was hard to eat.

Celestine has such an amazing location right under the Manhattan bridge, the views can not be beat. They also open all the exterior windows in summer that you're basically sitting on the water.

The menu has some standard Mediterranean dishes plus some more unique things I hadn't tried before. But, literally everything was delicious. We had...
-baba ghannouj
-pistachio feta spread
-Manti (so good)
-reginette
-cauliflower & broccolini
-mjuderah
-Persian potato

I recommend anything I listed above. This would be a great place for a special occasion because the view is so spectacular. I'm excited to come back later in fall/winter and check out the cozy vibes.

This place completely charmed me! Sat down for dinner at 6 and didn't leave until 9 - we watched the beautiful sun set behind the Manhattan Bridge, Brooklyn Bridge, and Manhattan skyline through the floor-to-ceiling windows. It's seriously romantic. Plus the waterfront restaurant is tucked away in a quiet area in Dumbo, I couldn't resist walking around outside afterwards.

What's more, the food is also amazing! They're not just relying on this ideal location. Definitely get a few dips to start, they come with freshly grilled bread doused in olive oil and za'atar spice. The hummus (5/5) was refreshingly lemony, and the pistachio feta spread (5/5)  is surprisingly complex and light with lots of herbs. Highly recommend the short rib manti (5/5) - it's so tender and delicious, and the broth it's on is supercharged with flavor. It reminded me of a french onion soup. Don't look down on the salad (5/5) either - refreshing, thoughtful components with lots of crisp cucumbers and fennel, and I loved the cheese they use. You must get the chermoula branzino for 2 (5/5) - it was actually large enough for 3 of us to split. I've never had chermoula but I'm in love, I would spread that rub on anything. Order that with a side of cauliflower tempura (5/5), which is the more tender stemmed kind of cauliflower, super crisp and delicious. Finish on a light note with the blueberry tart (4/5) which I thought was better than the honey almond cake (3/5). They also give you small cookies with the bill.

From my scores, you can probably tell I loved almost everything about our meal with the exception of the desserts, which I think could be stronger. Also note that prices are a bit on the steep side, but when almost everything is perfect it is worth the price. It was truly one of the most enjoyable and memorable meals!

They do have tables outside but it was a little too warm and windy for us that day - and they ended up opening up the far wall so we had a breeze in the evening!

The food is as breathtaking as the view of the Manhattan bridge and the river. I ordered a chicken kebab dish and it came with braised vegetables with a thick tartar-like sauce which tied the elements all together.
We sat outside by the river, and the atmosphere is perfect for celebrating any special occasion- the sound of the waves crashing against the shore makes it too perfect.

Had lunch this week with good friends at Celestine. Great location. Really nice outside deck with an awesome water view. Not a great spot for a lunch in January but it's got to be fantastic in the warmer months.

Staff was friendly and accommodating. We ordered a garden salad with grilled chicken, garden salad with grilled shrimp, grilled vegetable platter, pasta with tomato sauce, hummus and pistachio dip. Menu features healthy choices. Great for vegetarians as there are many choices. Food was prepared well, fresh and tasty.

I'd recommend if you are health conscious and or a vegetarian. They have great options.

I went to Celestine with friends for a Sunday brunch...
Lovely setting (I mean, the view is AMAZING) and great food!
The menu is quite small (which I personally like) and there are some brunch classics with a middle eastern twist.
Definitely a spot to keep in mind!!

Expensive but worth it. There vulcan cocktail and wild bass was the best on the valentine's day pre-fixed menu.

The broccolini tempura is very surprising. Best tasting, healthy, snack In nyc.

I definitely recommend and would come back here for the outdoor view in the summer.

A great experience overall. The staff were so kind and made everything pleasant despite the stressful situation restaurants are in. And everyone was wearing masks and being respectful.
The kale salad was a great light snack and the cocktails are so good! This is definitely a patio experience worth checking out.

Celestine has a gorgeous view right next to the Manhattan bridge. I came here for a client dinner and the views were stunning with the bridge lights and dimmed candlelight ambience. I think this would be a great place for a date night as well. We did a family style meal with various appetizers, mains and desserts. We had a couple drinks while we were waiting for the full party to arrive and I gotta say I loved the turmeric gin & tonic. You wouldn't typically expect a turmeric based drink to be good but they really did a great job with this one. The ginger and lime ingredients really complimented the drink. I also tried Pearable (pear, tequila, chile) and Olympia (vodka, raspberry, lemon, sparkling wine) which were tasty as well. For the food, I think the house-made flatbread was incredibly delicious, both soft and crispy with some evoo sprinkled on top. Their hummus and babaganoush went perfectly with the flatbread - wish they had given us more of it! I also really enjoyed the roasted winter squash dish which sat on a bed of orzo with hazelnuts and cranberries. The squash was nicely roasted on the outside and soft (but not in a super mushy way) on the inside. My favorite main dish was the steak, which was cooked medium rare and extremely tender and seasoned well. This dish was also huge and came after a many platters of apps and starters, so we couldn't finish it but we did take it to go to enjoy the next day. The desserts were classic Mediterranean desserts - the halva and honey almond cake - and very good!

A hidden treasure near the Manhattan Bridge! Views are amazing on a clear day, even when indoors. My friend and I ordered the Baba Ghannouj, Kale Salad, Shakshuka, and the French Toast Casserole. Baba Ghannouj was AMAZING. We split the flatbread, seasoned with lots of spice and herbs. The hummus had a tinge of spice in it as well and is flavorful enough to keep you occupied until the main dishes arrive.

I first tried the French Toast. It has a nice maple syrup consistency that holds it together. The bread is made softly and has a vanilla taste. It has the perfect amount of sweet and sour, I highly recommend!

I really liked the shakshuka as well. It tastes like a healthier alternative to Italian pizza. There is a lot of tomato, however, so avoid if you don't like it.

I didn't try the kale, but it looked pretty good from my angle.

Overall, the place's atmosphere with soft music, green plants, wood walls, big windows, proximity to the bridge, and food options are a solid 5/5. I'd definitely recommend for those who wander around Dumbo.

Celestine is my go-to when meeting up with family or taking them out to BK! The views in all seasons are super prestine and the service is exceptional!

The food is very simple, so if you are looking for something to make you full, this place isn't exactly that - but it does the job of ensuring that you aren't over eating.

I love this place and I hope it stays a while

I have picked Celestine to celebrate our 2nd wedding anniversary. Although their website clearly states that they cannot guarantee specific tables I have enquired about a nice seating as I wanted it to be a special evening. We were greeted promptly on our arrival. The restaurant wasn't super busy however most of the tables on their terrace seemed taken. They have given us a table inside but by the window so we could still get the nice view on the bridge and stunning evening skyline. Our server(s) were very swift and friendly. ( polite note- don't clear plates until all parties finished eating ).
We went for the ""family style"" set menu with the main course of chicken and sword fish. Chef has sent mezze appetisers with some flat bread and olives -delicious! as well as some accompaniments like melon with our mains. We wrapped up our meal with an almond cake and coffee mousse. Both delicious!!!! Italian sparkling wine complemented our meal beautifully.
On a down note the restaurant was a bit warm inside... we didn't want to case a fuss and ask for a table outside but perhaps we should have as there was a nice breeze coming from the river and few tables became available.Perhaps on our next visit! It's a very chic and intimate restaurant with a beautiful views and dimmed lights. It was just perfect for the occasion. Everyone made our evening enjoyable. We shall be back!

Extremely pricey with unfocused service.   You are mostly paying for the view, which is the underside of the Manhattan Bridge, which makes me wonder if even that is worth the price.  Still at sunset, with the all glass walls and the gentle setting, it is a lovely moment.

Drinks were novel and good.  Room pretty.  People also pretty.

However, the service left much to be desired.  The room was not full, and yet we suffered long waits for our courses and for our server's attention.
Our server floated about the room, exhibiting a casual, chatty manner, which, although it might delight some customers to have one's server making extended small talk at one's table, failed to deliver the attentive experience that I would expect for the very dear price this establishment demands for its Mediterranean offerings, many of which are simply street food with lipstick painted on (falafel, hummus, etc...).

I had the Flatiron steak, which consisted of 8 or 10 slices of tender and nicely seasoned meat but for the price, I could have enjoyed a formidable, dry aged 16 oz New York Strip at many a well known steakhouse in NYC.  My companions ordered the whole Branzino.  Again, delicious and tender, but for the price not so sure it was worth it.

The bill when it arrived, was heart stopping.  Never again.

The walk along the water following the dinner was the highlight of the evening.  It was a lovely night, comfortably temperate, with a light breeze.

Wonderful, thank you for accommodating my group for brunch today.  First of when I arrived both the host and hostess were beyond friendly and inviting.

First thing you notice is how busy Celestine is. They are a newbie but the word is spreading.  Once inside the most beautiful table was set and waiting for my party.  But, wait, we sat in the window taking in the most amazing views.

About our waiter? He was cheeky, full of life, loved his glasses, and he knew the menu. This would be food and drinks. As he gave the verbal rundown one could vividly imagine the dishes described and hunger started to kick in, as anticipation built on trying one of the dishes by there sheer description. He recommended I have the lamb, as he stated, ""you just can't go wrong with it.""

You might ask yourself why I kept referring to my waiter as ""he"" that's my fault not his. However, his clear eye glasses were on point!

[*Carl, that's the name of the chap who waited on us!]

Drinks, yes delish from the yellow jacket to the mezcal cocktail. The baba ganoush was simply divine - creamy, well spiced, and portions were on point.

This is a must place to brunch with friends and people watch. The service is top notch, and everyone touches base on entry and exit, giving you that personal touch.  Plus, smiling faces everywhere.  That is a huge bonus.

This is a date spot alert.  Views, sunset, cocktails - midsummer night outdoor seating. It's a recipe for fun fun fun!!!

Unfortunately, despite calling ahead to ensure we would have a table, the hostess was intent on articulating that the restaurant is not a welcoming place for customers. We arrived with less than 5 occupied tables in the place, and the restaurant remained largely empty through the course of our meal.

Yet, when we walked in, no one greeted us, leaving us to stand by the door for nearly a minute, wondering if they were actually open for business. When the host finally graced us with her presence, she started the interaction by rolling her eyes while asking if we made a reservation. We did. Went downhill from there.

There were leftover food bits on the unwashed drinking glass at our table. When I pointed the dirty dish out to our waiter, instead of handing us a clean glass from the multiple unoccupied tables next to us, he left to ""get us a new glass"". This took over 8 minutes. The water we asked for took over 15 minutes to arrive. Drinks (draft beer) also took unusually long, considering that the restaurant was empty.

The food was clearly microwaved and drenched in stale olive oil to compensate for the rubbery texture. Previous reviews also echo this. The view is nice, but not worth the abusive service athmosphere! If you want to watch the view from here, be mentally prepared for bad vibes and extremely overpriced and subpar food.

This is the only expensive restaurant where I have actually thought the food worth it. I came here for dinner as a Turk, expecting to be disappointed as I am with most Mediterranean-themed restaurants. I ordered the octopus dish with ayran, expecting to be served the Turkish yogurt drink alongside some grilled octopus. When it came out, there was no sight of ayran. I asked the waiter where it was. He said, ""It's right there. It's in the sauce."" And there it was. That was a first.

Skeptical, I tried the food. The main dishes were surprisingly not very Mediterranean--there are just 3, and one of them is called ""Pennsylvania chicken"". I don't remember PA being anywhere near Mare Nostrum. Despite this, the chicken was delicious. In fact, it was one of the most delicious dishes I have ever had. My partner had the vegetarian carrot dish, which was surprisingly filling and almost as good.

Celestine definitely has an innovative chef at work. One thing about Mediterranean food is that it has not been very creative since the 19th century, when many classics were invented. That also makes it hard to get very wrong. Celestine takes a chance with its food. And it works really, really well.

Been wanting to go to this place for a long time and finally ended up going here for a Friday night date with my boyfriend. Although we had reserved a table at 8, surprisingly it was not so packed by the time we got there. The restaurant is built on the waterfront, you can see the Manhattan bridge of you sit near the window. Unlike the River cafe by Brooklyn bridge, Celestine is less expensive and doesn't require formal attire which made both of us very comfortable. The food is very authentic Mediterranean, the waitress who served us is very sweet, she kept on asking if we needed anything else and recommended good dessert. The atmosphere in the restaurant is romantic and classy, perfect for date nights. In my opinion Celestine is the best option for a waterfront dining experience around DUMBO

Celestine is a holy grail. You get a gorgeous Manhattan view while dining riverside without paying a premium for the experience- all the while eating delicious food! Bonus: they carbonate their water in house so you can get bottomless sparkling water for free!

We stumbled upon Celestine after bouldering at DUMBO on a wonderful sunny day. Celestine has a unique setup. There's a large spacious indoor dining space, but the walls that face the waterfront are actually glass doors that can open up to create an airy dining atmosphere. They also have true outdoor dining tables around the perimeter outside the restaurant. We sat at a table indoors right next to the doors that opened up to the river- fresh air in the shade!

We ordered the hummus platter to share, and they gave enough pita bread that each person at the table could have one. Interestingly, because of the way the pita was arranged, one pita got all the olive oil and spice, and so we had to smear the oil on all the other pieces of pita bread.

This was my first time ordering a salad at a restaurant (other than my weekly Sweetgreen trips), but I couldn't resist because the Baby Kale Salad looked delicious! I thought the Bee Pollen vinaigrette would taste more like honey, but honestly, it tasted more vinaigrette than any other bee-like product. The freekeh and mushroom (yum!) helped to make the salad a lot heartier.

This is definitely on my list of favorite restaurants thanks to the awesome al fresco dining option and gorgeous view. I will be coming back time and time again with visitors!

Beautiful restaurant and impeccable food. I was thoroughly impressed because I did not expect the food to be so good. The restaurant is not that big and don't worry every table has a great view. Elaine took great care of us and was so friendly and sweet.

We had the platter for appetizer, along with crispy falafel and short rib dumplings. For entree we had the chicken and the branzino, Brussels sprouts and lentil and rice. Every dish was so flavorful and delicious. The branzino was cooked to perfection, Probably one of the best I've tried. The chicken was delicious and came with grapes and nuts. The was surprised how well the ingredients went, because I would never imagine grapes in my chicken.

I love that they have a seasonal menu. I will definitely return in the summer to experience their out door seating and lunch menu.

Views here are pretty great! In addition it's not crowded and most of the clientele are families and younger professionals -- so super chill and not too busy.

The menu and food here is pretty simple there isn't much to chose from, I'm not super into Mediterranean food however I didn't mind it!

I did love the flatbread and the pistachio dip! So so good!

The service was excellent and all very very kind!

I would come back on a summer/spring day however it's a little bit pricey!

Great views. The highlight was the baba ganoush, hummus was just ok, the flat bread and za'tar the first round were good the 2nd round burnt.
The mushrooms/kale reginette had burnt pieces of, apparently kale, which made us leave the dish unfinished.
The falafel/thahini and mushy peas were good.
So a star for the food and a star for the view.
Our server, whoever had a man-bun, took the order and never came back, we went through our entire dinner and he didn't check on us once, the host brought us a bottle of water, refill, after we flagged him over since our waiter was completely ignoring us. We decided to just get the check and leave, not a pleasant evening, sad.

The best part of this restaurant is the view. We waited over an hour to be seated, the hostess was a mess. If you're planning on going here, definitely make a reservation. She didn't make us feel welcome at all.  Once we were finally seated, the waitress refused to take an order for an appetizer and informed us that she would only take a full order. Reviewing the menu was quick since its such a short menu, and we're finally able to put in an order. The Za'tar flatbread was first to come out, and honestly was disappointing. The bread was burnt in spots, overly oiled and barely had any Za'tar on it. The chicken entra was delicious. Unfortunately, my wife found a little cockroach on her table napkin. The waitress gave us a new napkin and explained that the door was open for outdoor seating.

Overall this place has a great view, but is slow in seating and service while serving pretentiously made food without attention to detail. The value is existent- you're paying for the view. I liked this spot the first couple times, but I think I'm over it now.  Plenty of other options with great views in Dumbo.

I went here for a lunch date. We sat inside and it was quiet and relaxed. The view was so nice and it's in such a nice location. The wait staff were so nice and the service was prompt and polite.

We ordered the pistachio feta spread (think hummus), the lamb wrap, and the beef brisket burger. The pistachio hummus was absolutely amazing. I'm a huge fan, it was a little on the salty side, but hey, I love salt, bring it on. The lamb wrap was also really good, although I tend to not be a huge fan of lamb. The burger I was a little disappointed in. It was kind of a greasy mess and the brioche bun it came on just got so soggy. It did come with some cute pickled (radish?) thing that was super yummy! And the fries were salty and slightly spicy in a delicious way.

What a beautiful place for brunch!! The view is stunning.   Great place for a celebration or to impress an out of towner.  Good service.

The food

I started with the mezcal cocktail and it is delicious!!  Yes to this!
After that we had:

Shakshuka -  very tasty!  Added harissa for an additional kick.
Lamb kebab-  good but not great.
The bread that comes with each dish is also very good.  No need to order separately.

Diverse menu and unique drinks. The brunch items are large quantities and decent prices. The French toast was out of this world, the eggs were okay (I think my tomatoes were canned). Came during COVID, and was able to sit outside due to nice weather. You also have a nice view of the water if you sit outside. Our service was okay, would come again for the pizza!!

Industry Kitchen is a great place to come to during COVID. It's the perfect place for outdoor seating, drinks and views. Last night I shared a margarita pizza and garlic fries with a friend. They were both good, like average. I live in the neighborhood and I would go back for the ambience and setting more so than the food. Our waitress was really nice and honored the one beer because it was the last one.

Good location with a river view to meet a friend in New York City.

The location is close to ferries and trains. Although it's situated in an old part of town that evokes Melville's Bartleby, the Scrivener, Industry Kitchen has a modern, fun, airy feel.

The menu includes salads, nonconformist pizzas, vegetable sides, and larger entrees featuring salmon and steak. Vegetarians and meat-eaters should find options. There is also a unique list of cocktails plus a full bar.

I was happy with the Burrata al Tartufo ($23
Gruy√®re, baby arugula, toasted almonds, truffle shavings, Himalayan sea salt) and Pot of Mussels ($19 shallots, butter, garlic, white wine, cilantro; herbed focaccia), splitting both with one friend.

Staff is friendly and professional. Checks in on you at all the right moments.

Covid or not, Industry Kitchen was MADE for outside dining.

Great food and excellent waterfront location near Wall St / Pier 11 Ferry.  You can tell the proprietors haven't sold their soul and still care deeply about quality and service staff- because it comes across in all the touch-points.

The hanger steak is great quality steak and at a price point ($26) that makes it an easy choice for a weeknight out.  The pot of mussels has a wine garlic sauce that is on the perfect border of light and rich, dancing between the two with each bite.  Downeast Unfiltered Cider wasn't on the menu, but when asked, we learned that it was in fact available- score!

Had an absolutely delightful evening from start to finish- helped by a beautiful sunset along the East River.  Definitely bringing friends back again.

This place gets 3 stars for the glass tents and being on the East river. We as a group of 8 so we were able to be seated in two tents at 6 pm. They don't have any seasonal drinks and cocktail list is basic. We ordered appetizers which were not good. The other table has pizzas which they seemed to enjoy but not great.

Service was great.
COVID-19 precautions great
Igloo tents great
Food not impressed

This was the first time I've been out to eat in the city since March and it was just really nice.  The view of the water made the outdoor eating experience enjoyable.
We ordered the seasonal dips as an appetizer and that might have been the best part of my meal. Not because the food wasn't good, but because the dips were THAT good. I kept finding myself going back to them throughout the meal (and even dipping my pizza crusts into them!).
For the main meal we ordered the margarita pizza.  It was good.  Nothing over the top special. But still very good.

Overall I really loved being able to go out to eat and Industry Kitchen didn't disappoint!

Came here with a few friends for their outdoor dining and was not all that impressed (3.5/5). Pretty average spot but maybe part of the experience was missed coming at night when it was dark and the water view wasn't that great.

Ordered the seasonal dips for appetizer (not pictured) which was just fine. For main we got the diablo pizza and the burrata al tartufo pizzas. I think the diablo pizza was interesting and more memorable with the spicy cheesy crust used and who doesn't like chorizo, cheese, peppers and heat, and aioli?? The burrata was alright, but didn't really care for it one way or another. Same thoughts on the dessert - chocolate river. It was not bad, but not sure if worth ordering out here.

This is a really chill outdoor restaurant on the water at the FDR.
The pizza is good. If do not eat meat be careful with menu because you may miss it given the Italian language.
Service  and seating does not take long.
They have some covered seating areas which will be helpful as it gets colder. But I think some warmers will be needed.

Industry Kitchen is a fantastic outdoor dining option right now. Great drinks, bites, and view of the water.

I made a reservation for 6 on my bday and the table was ready to go when I arrived. There was plenty of room on the long tables and attentive service.

My table got a few orders of the Diablo pizza and the potato curls. The Diablo pizza is excellent - interesting and tasty. It's not too spicy if that's of concern. The potato curls were okay - not crispy enough.

Cocktails we're all good, but on the sweet side. Also have a solid beer and wine menu.

Great location in the South Street Seaport area! Very scenic view of Brooklyn, and there's a generous amount of tables (all socially distanced, or course). Came here for dinner with my boyfriend and we were seated immediately upon arrival (we had reservations). We were slightly worried about rain, but a good amount of the tables are under an alcove, and the others have umbrellas. Still wouldn't recommend coming during a downpour, but light rain isn't a huge deal at this place!

We decided to share the Bianca pizza, and I had the truffle tagliatelle for my entree (without salami). It was a great casual meal - the ricotta on the pizza was to die for, and I love all truffle pastas (adult Mac and cheese, as I often call them)! Service was friendly and quick, even though the restaurant was relatively busy. All in all, a great experience - would be interested in coming back to try their brunch, as well!

The views are amazing , and perfect for a date , birthday or just an after work dinner.
The burrata pizza was so goood ! The steak was very well seasoned and made to perfections , the chips/fries it came with were so deliciously well, and whatever garlic sauce they added to the side was delicious
The Cali flower with beets appetizer, was really good too, definitely worth getting to try , interesting blend of flavors

Socially distanced outdoor eating. Also saw the enclosed seating they will used when it gets cold out. Loved the avocado toast and wild omelette. They didn't rush us at all so we enjoyed the outdoor space and view for a while. Support local businesses!

This is a great fair-weather location situated right on the water's edge in Manhattan just south of south street seaport.

Perfect for lunch or dinner, they've got plenty of outside seating and their normal menu which has delicious pizzas as well as a good number of food options for those who wants lots of veggies. The salmon filet comes seated on a plate of purple potatoes that are pretty amazing. I also had the burrata pizza and it was delectable. I strongly recommend going and savoring the food, ambiance, polite and attentive service, and view while the summer weather is here and while outdoor seating is the only option. Once you're able to sit indoors, you hold on to the incredible view of the river and of Brooklyn as the entire restaurant is glass. You also get that winter coziness from the open kitchen with its big brick-oven-style pizza oven's fire visible from the entire right-hand side of the restaurant.

Stopped by Industry Kitchen for brunch on a busy Sunday afternoon. We had a reservation so were seated immediately but in any case they seemed to be managing the crowd well.

Love the Breakfast Pizza - great combination of ingredients and nicely put together. The Lobster Omelet was also very good. The Watermelon Salad was refreshing but perhaps a little too much Feta cheese relative to the Watermelon.

Overall, great place for a casual meal and felt comfortable with the distancing of tables given the current environment.

I went there with a friend, we didn't have a reservation but we were seated right away, the restaurant was empty (which is a reason to take good care of the customers) but unfortunately the  service they provide is bad. We got a table for almost 2 hours and no one came to ask how is everything or is anything missing! Strange! I only have 4 stars because of the food, it was amazing we got salmon and pasta some dips and dessert and everything was great THANKS TO THE CHEFS.
if you're willing to go there dont expect them to take good care of you. Just order your food and enjoy it that's it.

One early January I decided to gamble my hour lunch break and head to this restaurant for a three course winter prix fixe lunch special for $26.  The staff was knowledgeable of my hour time frame so I was taken care of.

My whole was about 45 minutes long, the soup was filling that I took half of the portions to go for next day leftovers and to make room for the entree and dessert. Everything tasted so good.  My favorite of the three was the skirt steak with fries. The fries was impressively crispy and the steak was a perfect medium rare.

The restaurant is now opened for outdoor dining which I can't wait to go back to once I return to work on site :-)

Wow. I walk by Industry Kitchen all the time and finally stopped in to see why I always see their patio packed. I'm surprised I managed to even get pictures it all looked and tasted so good!

I had a Seaport Rye to get my whiskey fix and it was perfectly balanced. So I ordered 2 more of those...

I did have a burrata starter, but I ate it before taking a picture. Sorry. Had the Diablo pizza as the main and I ate the entire thing! These aren't exactly small pies either. It was delicious.. I wouldn't change a thing about it.

I'll definitely be back!

Still one of my favorite places in the neighborhood. Haven't been here in a while but was very happy to see they have outdoor seating beautifully arranged and following all the safety guidelines ! Amazing job by this Management. Our server was Olivia and she was very charming and helped guide us through our selections, we enjoyed the burrata salad, seasonal dips ( yum yum yum ) , a cheese board , hanger steak prepared exactly the way I like it , medium , and the chicken entree. Nothing , absolutely nothing disappointed ! This place is a must visit , in Arnold Schwarzenegger's voice ... ""I'll be back !""

Never fails to give an amazing experience from start to finish. I've visited several times over the past few years but keep forgetting to write a review because the food and service is what should always be expected, good. However , this evening , was hands down a truly memorable dining experience. The drinks ( summer house and froze ) were deliciously refreshing and well put together. The server was knowledgeable and guided us towards dishes that were tasty and hit all the right notes. We enjoyed the diablo pizza , octopus salad , lamb shank and my constant repeat item... the floating garlic bread , yummmmmy! Service , food , and the manager  who checked on us , Isandro , made this evening unforgettable for a pair of friends who had not seen each other in ages ! Thank you Industry kitchen for the memories ! Highly recommend!

One of my fav spots in Fidi during the summer/warm weather! Brunch menu  + cocktails are fantastic. Friendly and fast service, great view. A tad pricey but expected when you have waterfront seating in Manhattan.

I hate to write this review because I live in FiDi and come to IK quite a lot, but last night was just terrible. I know the outside area is packed but my server wasn't attentive in the slightest. She would work only one table at a time (instead of checking with all of her tables before heading back) which, as a former server and bartender, is just not the way to run a section. More on this later.

The gentlemen at the host stand who took my number told me the wait was 20 minutes and he'd text, well having waited 30 minutes and starving I returned hoping my table was close to being ready so I went back. Turns out he had multiple tables open but told me he didn't think I'd like any of them (I just didn't want to sit behind the host stand or around the back of the restaurant, sitting off to the end of where normal tables are was totally fine). This was annoying because I was starving.

Then it was at least 8 minutes before my server arrived (though I was given water), and I ordered what I order every two weeks when I allow myself red meat, the hanger steak and vegetables (I'm not allowed to eat starchy vegetables for medical reasons).

The wine took forever, which is whatever, like I said she was basically waiting on one table then running inside, then she'd check on another and run inside -- truly her life would be easier if she'd just touch each table as she walked back to see if anything is needed. Once the wine came I was happy listening to my podcasts and enjoying the weather.

Then the food arrived. Now, it's about 9pm at this point and I can't see very well and so I cut the steak and take the bite and I thought, hmmm that's extremely chewy, maybe it's just a bad piece. Then I took another bite and not 2 seconds later I spit it out because I knew the meat was basically raw. I put the light from my phone on and looked and it was in fact COMPLETELY RAW in the middle. I ordered the steak medium because, though I get a cut like NY or filet medium rare, tougher cuts like hanger and strip I prefer medium because they do tend to be chewy.

When I was finally able to flag down the server I asked her to make sure they didn't just throw the already sliced pieces back on the grill because then you're left with car tire pucks and she nodded. I got another glass of wine I could tell this was going to be a long night.

The plate arrives, and as I predicted, the same steak had been thrown on the fire. I flagged the server down again and explained I tried to prevent this from happening and if they are not willing to cook a steak properly for me I'd just pay for my wine and go somewhere else. She nodded and scurried off. I got a third glass of wine this was getting painful.

Round three steak comes and my god, it's rare, maybe rare+. I ate around a few pieces because at this point I was about to eat the plate but it was awful. And the vegetables weren't cooked hardly at all and they were ice cold.

Listen I get this is Covid and things are strained etc etc, but this place is hopping and there is plenty of room to distance. It's one of the only places I would go because it feels safer than most others. Well, not anymore.

The server saw I barely touched my food and said nothing. I asked for the check and paid. Unfortunately this will be the last time I visit IK. It was just unpleasant and frustrating from start to finish and the thing is, it didn't need to be. If the place was packed to capacity with people all over waiting that could maybe excuse the food and service, but it was a calm, fairly slow evening by the time I was sat. Covid was not the problem here.

Oh the pic I've included is of the 3 rd round steak I was brought. Again, it's supposed to be cooked medium (warm pink center with some brown edges). That my friends, is rare.

Location and setup is ideal for outdoor dining and covid. The outdoor deck is scattered with picnic tables by the water, so bring a jacket just in case it gets windy. I enjoyed the Siracha Chorizo Omelette with the side of their home fries which resemble more of herb roasted potatoes than french fries. The Bianca Pizza was tasty but lacked flavor and could have used more time in the oven. I was curious about the Seasonal Dips which I think would have been a better option. Nothing particularly stood about the place though.

Came here for the first time because I knew they had good outdoor dining. Location is great there is a really pretty view. I got the spicy marg and I'd give it a 10/10. My friend got the froze which was also really good, you can add a flavor to it if you want (she got strawberry) which I thought was really fun. Both drinks were served with plastic straws which I loved. For food we got the cauliflower, the burrata pizza, and the Diablo pizza. All the food was great, but the Diablo pizza deserves an extra shoutout because it was just so iconic. PSA definitely make a reservation before coming here they were not taking walk ins.

Asked if we had a reservation, when we said no she said we arent taking any walk ins... walked away made a reservation on open table within that 5 minutes. She saw us come back and sat us. Wtf is that? Then when sat says we are only serving pizza and salad and walked away. Tourist attraction since its by the water but you need to get someone worth payin, hostice was a joke. Menu sucked

11/8/2020Hello Nikki,
I am sorry to see the one star review but on the weekends we serve brunch until 4 pm and for the next hour we have a limited menu as the kitchen prepares for dinner.
Our Open Table system allows us to control and monitor all the walk-in's and reservations, sometimes we need to stop and allow only reservations. I saw that you have made the reservation for 4:30 pm but still you were sat just after 4pm.
We are sorry for any misunderstanding.

Great location, jokingly overpriced. I got the margherita pizza which is a bar pie size (personal) pizza thats either $17 or $18. Sauce, cheese, and some basil on a crust that resembled the Lunchables pizza cracker. Industry Kitchen is a place to go to in the summer on a Friday night when you want to blow half your paycheck on cocktails and sit outside. You're better off picking up a good pizza, buying a 6 pack, and sitting on the benches near the water about 15 feet away from the restaurant's outdoor seating and enjoy the night.

Gorgeous setting! Great spot to wait for the ferry and warm up on a cold night. Brooklyn lights
dance across the water and the moonlight is reflected in the ripples. Must be amazing in the summer out under that moon.

The bar tender was attentive and fast serving up a good perfect Manhattan - from what I gather not an everyday order.

I chose the mussels which came with delicious broth and tons of focaccia for dipping. It would have been plenty to share, but it made for a big dinner for one.

Lots of folks all around me were ordering the wood fired pizza which also seemed to be a big hit.

Photo of Industry Kitchen - New York, NY, United States. The best deal on the menu in my opinion- the mussels were fantastic!

I'm not a fan of pizza but this is probably some of the best I have had. The Vegan pizza was amazing but that's pretty much it. Very cool concept of sitting by the water and having a quick bite. Slow service and mediocre pricey drinks.  We kept having to flag the waitress down because she never checked on us.

Great place to dine during the pandemic.  First, seating outside is expansive, just be aware of the time of day and weather as tables might be under the hot sun.  The host was nice enough to let us pick our own table and we got one that became shadier as our meal progressed.

The food was solidly good.  Had the watermelon gazpacho soup which was excellent.  A well balanced mix of sweet and sour, some hints of mint, mango and other flavors.  Could have had this dish all day long!  Then we split an avocado toast, nice but nothing out of the ordinary.  There were large chunks of feta atop the avocado and an interesting brush of olive paste lining the bottom of the plate.  Nice presentation.

We had the pizza which is thin and good, and a side of chicken apple sausage.  For drinks we had the bloody mary, which could have done with just a little more heat to balance the sourness.

Overall a great meal and nice views of the river, Brooklyn Bridge and beyond.

My friends and I made reservations for brunch here on a Saturday and I was pleasantly surprised with the size of the establishment. I expected it to be pretty packed especially since it's located on the waterfront, but there was still a couple empty tables available.

My party was seated in an outdoor table which was perfect on a cool cloudy day. This place would be a great place to enjoy your food and drink while people watching at the same time. It was a little squished in terms of the surrounding tables, but it didn't bother us too much. Service was great in terms of ordering and receiving our food, but I found it a little hard to flag down our waitress for anything else I needed.

Food was great - my party ordered family style so that we could try a variety of dishes. We ordered 2 pizzas, 2 sides, and the caramel waffle. I would definitely recommend trying the waffle, it was AMAZING - definitely my favorite across the board.

Only other downside I would say is the structure of the bathroom. It didn't bother me that stalls were unisex, but there were 2 doors for the entrance and they were right next to each other. So when I was waiting on line for a stall, I got hit with the other door pretty hard by another guy who was trying to get in. Having two doors seemed pretty redundant and dangerous. I would be extra cautious while in there.

Ducked into this place on a weeknight to get out of the rain. Sat at the bar and ordered grilled cauliflower, which came out on a bed of smashed avocado with parmesan cheese atop it. It was pretty good, but not as good as the grilled octopus.

Great vibe and atmosphere here, right on the water. The service was very good.

I'd come back. :)

My name is Aylon and I am the general manager of Industry Kitchen.
We do not have or use poste mate. Our delivery services are Grub hub and Seamless. I have told their delivery guy that we don't have that pizza anymore and he just walked away.
We took the alligator pizza off the menu before Covid-19.
I would appreciate if you can take this review off as we work very hard to provide great service.
I can assure you that I will call them first thing tomorrow and address the issue.

Industrial kitchen is located near the Ferry terminal. Came here for brunch one Saturday.

The restaurant is huge, with both indoor and outdoor seating. The decor is very American. The tables outside I felt were akin to picnic tables, which I thought gave the restaurant a nice summer feeling.

The service and prices at this place a reasonable. Nothing spectacular but nothing to complain about either.

The food was OK. I had a glass of sparkling wine as my drink though I was disappointed they did not have Mamosa's. I ordered the egg white omelette. The omelette came with a side salad and home fries. The home fries were delicious cooked to perfection. The salad was OK. However my eggs were over cooked they were almost like rubber and hard to eat. I hope this was a one time thing and the chef was just having a bad day.

Overall just for the location I would give this place another chance.

High tech, high energy environment with loud music and high level of noise.

I did enjoy the design and the large glass areas looking out to South Street Seaport and the Brooklyn Bridge.

We came for lunch and the place was humming with activity.  Ordered a pizza (Bianca) and it was real good, nice crust and cheese distributed evenly.

Service was attentive and good.  A bit off the beaten path but worth a visit, especially for lunch.

Pandemic review! They have backyard and outdoor seating in the front. Two tables out front, but not sure what is in the back. They have either on tap brews or they have a beer shoppe that you can buy a set of beers or ciders as well. We did some beers on tap - they had other half, grimm etc so good variety and quality too. The bartender was awesome. Place was queen + bathroom. Open until 9 pm right now. Never knew this place existed until a friend told me about it!

A few colleagues and I came here on a Friday evening. I am not a beer drinker but I will say if I were this would be a nice hole in the wall spot. They have a great selection of beers (both tap and bottled). According to the regular in the group, they switch up the menu every so often. I can't remember the name of the tap beer I got but I do remember it was the number 5 as of (10/18/19). Shoutout to the bartender for pointing me in this direction after I explained to him I am not a beer drinker but did like IPAs. I enjoyed my glass and went for another.

The crowd wasn't too bad when we arrived around 6pm, it did begin to pick up around 8pm. They have a back patio (not sure if it is open year round). The only downside to my experience was that bartender was the only person catering to the entire bar. Also they claim to have a wine selection but it is very limited. Other than that no complaints!

Random Side note: The restroom was also sparkling clean... I mean  extremely clean lol.

Oh the bar seats are open and there are 5 available for a part of 2. We picked the best seats with the view of their 42inch? Tv.

The menu is filled with craft beer from mostly NY and some Maine brews. Ranging from light to dark beer, our bartender is very glad to let us try couple. I forgot what they were except #5 and #16 are our choices. For $8 you can get a 16oz last around 1 hours if you nurture it. Behind the bar, there is a stack and racks of can beer. You can buy them to go. I know there's a backyard which is decent sized probably seats 20 people.

Food wise. I saw some chip behind the counter and a lot of plate. We didn't order any food but maybe next time.

The service is expected of a bar. Ask for a drink, you get a drink. Ask anytime else, you can get a ""I don't know"" or ""why you ask me"" look. Avoid asking stupid question.

It's good to drink in Brooklyn. Ya know, just in case the brewery you wanted to visit was closed due to a wedding (note: have wedding at brewery). Instead you can always find a place not too far off like St. Gambrinus Beer Shoppe.

This was back in those carefree summer days when I ventured to Gowanus with a couple o' chums and had to alter plans for our third beer stop due to said private libation celebration. It's cool though because I wouldn't have found SGBS. Now? I know an awesome place to flight it up and buy some brews (for later).

Ya see, this place is like a specialty shop (or shoppe?) that is devoted to the enjoyment of beer. Walk in and you can hang at the bar area and grab a flight of varying Burrough brewed beer or perhaps you want to peruse the wall of cans and bottles available for purchase on the go. We did a little of both.

Truth be told, the brews I tried were somewhat forgettable (or at least forgettable enough that I can't remember them as I type this). But hey, that's  not really what's important. It's about the chill, laid back vibe of the place. It's about Brooklyn roots it seems to grow (figuratively, though the courtyard area is a nice touch). And it's about beer and just being in a place that shares the same level of love you probably (hopefully) have.

Overall, St. Gambrinus Beer Shoppe is a stop worthy of taking any time you find yourself in Brooklyn. No reason is needed. Just go, try a few brews, maybe buy some cans, and know that a place like this exists (especially for those days when a brewery just doesn't cut it).

Great place to sit with a beer.  Ambiance is chill, so it's a great place to meet up with friends and chat.  They have an awesome selection both on tap and otherwise and their snacks are tasty, although I wish they offered something a little more in that department.  (Girls gonna have a beer or two or three? Girls gonna need a snack.)
Would definitely check it out if you're a beer fan.

Great beer/cider selection to stay or to takeaway. They sell a good amount of drafts and have a nice mix of ips, sours, ales, and stouts. I'm a cider drinker and I love that they always have a nice little selection to choose from in the to-go area.

The atmosphere is lovely, it's a cozy spot with lots of little tables and boardgames to share. The bartenders are always friendly and they have small bites to order if you're hungry. It's never too loud and there's usually a place to sit and try something new.

I'm really looking forward to checking out their patio when the weather is nice.

Cool Concept

A great place to go for a beer - they usually have at least 16 different beers on tap. And they'll give you a free taste in case you're not sure you'll like the beer. If you want something other than a beer, there's wine, cider and soft drinks. Oh, and they have charcuterie, cheese and pita chips and Middle Eastern dips as well. The place has a nice, relaxed vibe.

The place always has some great tunes playing.  A very chilled crowd looking to sip on a couple of craft beers.

Thanks

If you're wondering whether or not this place is the place to go in a sea of bars, then yes, this is the place. I'll make up your mind for you. You're welcome.

We wandered around the neighborhood on a lazy Sunday afternoon with the intention of eating brunch. Of course, the first order of business was to Yelp for somewhere respectable, but the results showed that to be too far of a walk. So this place pops up on what I call the ""yum radar"" with lots of stars. We decided, what the heck, let's get our drink on first and then worry about food. Done. Maybe they'll have some pub food too.

After making ourselves comfortable, the second order of business was to search online what the significance of St. Gambrinus is. I didn't know this, but it's named after the patron saint of beer, the king of beer, the big kahuna, you get my drift.. So that means that this place is pretty great. Yes indeedy!

We bought a flight of beers to see what IPA variety they offered, and lo and behold I didn't know any of the names or breweries. It shows you what kind of beer connoisseur I am! Obviously the bartender is the expert and she suggested the flight that we enjoyed. I do, however, know the warm and tingly sensations beer can make, so hello old friend. As we made our way across the the numbered beer map, not unlike Nicolas Cage in National Treasure, it became obvious that I cared more about food at a certain point, and ditched this number to name game.

When it came to ordering food, it was more of the opposite experience to what I expected. I ordered what I thought would be bar food, but instantly regretted it when the bartender told me to come back in 5 minutes. Ok, so the bartender makes my food. Fair enough. Faster forward to 5 minutes and I'm not impressed. We finish our panini slabs and I'm still hungry.

I think it's unfair to give this place a bad rap based on the lack of great food, but it makes up with the vast selection of beer and open space. However, I will still deduct one star since I was still hungry.

Fantastic beer list and really awesome bartenders. They offer a flight option where the price slightly decreases depending on what you order. I was annoyed last time because there was a $1/flight markup on almost ALL of the beers on tap.

Basically, 7 4oz pours is $14. But, because everything was marked up because of rarity (presumably), that would go up to $21 for 7...which is nuts.

Regardless, the taps are excellent and so is the can selection. They have a very small selection of beer you can buy to take home, but it's expertly curated and there's great stuff available. One of the few places you'll find Interboro, KCBC, etc. available in cans outside of the brewery.

I'll definitely be back...let's just hope they get those markups on taps under control!

I remember being here a really really long time ago in the winter or fall when I was claiming a beer book coupon years ago. I really enjoyed the space and didn't have much reason for coming back other than it just escaping my mind and not being in the immediate area. I was early for a Yelp Event next door at their virtual reality place and remembered this and stepped in for a drink. Still really cool place and they have an outdoor garden area in the back I wasn't aware of before. Didn't check out their cans in the small fridge in the back but they have so much on tap of unique beers. I tried a coconut salty gose and a sour cider that tasted apparently like mezcal. Happy hour is a dollar off drafts and you can also get a smaller glass if you don't want to commit to spending money on a full 16 oz pour. Felt like prices might be a dollar or two higher than other beer shoppes in Brooklyn. They do have some small bites on their menu like chips, pimento cheese, paninis, etc. but I was good and didn't order anything. I am curious though about what's up with the harry potter looking witch hat situated at the bar.

Pros: good selection, friendly bartenders, fun hangout spot
Cons: none

When im in Brooklyn I always make it a point to stop in here.  They have a great location in close proximity to the barclay subway stop.  The selection here is really quite good.  There are times when I dont really find anything to get too excited over and then others when youll find head scratching gems! You can drink on premisis for a corkage fee, but they have a taplist that seems to always have some local beers that youll be more than happy to grab a pour of.

The real draw for here is the friendliness and passion of the staff.  You can tell they work here because they love craft beer.  Ive had many good times chatting with the friendly patroms and staff.  I look forward to stopping in on my next NY trip.

Admittedly, I've known about St. Gambrinus for a few years (since it opened) and never stopped by despite living 5 minutes away. But we finally stopped in, and it was a fun experience.

Bartender (owner maybe?) was a super cool guy. Loved his beer, but wasn't a snob. Speaking of beer, their selection is top notch, both in bottles and on draft. And yes, they also do growlers!

They have a cozy backyard. They also have food, but we didn't order any.

Will definitely be returning! Might just have to join their beer club...

My usual go to for anything happening at Barclays

The staff are always friendly, the beers always flowing and the ambience always inviting. What more do you need from a beer shop?? Ah yes, the patron saint of beer!

That said, the outside patio is a nice touch on a perfect spring or fall day. The selection is top notch, both bottle and draught! They do a nice job rotating local and out of state beers. The pricing is respectable considering the quality being offered.

Check this place out when you have time so you can take advantage of their superb beer selection! Make it a point to stop in before a game!

I have a new favorite hangout spot near the Atlantic Center. AND NO, It's not Buffalo Wild Wings. A plague on that place! Besides it would be super weird for a review of that to be in here.

I don't know who Saint Gambrinus is. I'm sure I could google it and find out. I'd rather not though. I'd like to imagine he's the angel of beer and happiness, because that's what this place is to me. Beer and happiness. So don't ruin it by telling me. Oh wait, it's on their menu. Dammit.

The beer selection, value and servings here are fantastic. You can get different sized pours, mix up what you want, and do what you want, all at a low low price!

They have lot of limited edition beers here as well. And while I've only been here to consume drinks while I was here, they have an extensive selection of beer for people looking to buy on the go. Even for you growler heads.

It's great for going to before the Barclays. And if you bought/intend to buy tickets from stubhub, guess who is next door? Score!

When it's nice out, they got a little backyard area. If you want to switch it up, they have some nice wines. And if you're feeling hungry, they got some snacks. This place is a gem!

Make sure you come by and check it out.

Good beer.  Monday's are best.  The rest of the week is sad.  The beer is good.  I'll be back on a Monday cuz the service makes me glad.  The crowd is ok.  Typical for the area.  However, there were other times when I didn't feel 100 percent welcome.   I'll be back for the beer and cross my fingers when I bring my pals there on any day other than a Monday.  Go Monday!!!!

Always a great experience. My wife is a picky beer drinker but we always manage to find a sour or ipa that works for her. The outside space is nice as well.

Plus you can buy beers to take home. Been here many times and even suggested by my wife we stop by.

Art recommended this place so I swung on by. Wow, Atlantic Av has really changed a lot since I was last here years ago. I honestly didn't recognize it.

Bar is really close to subway and it's cozy. When I first sat down, I don't think the bartender liked me too much for some strange reason but then quickly warmed up. Came in the middle of the day and there were about 4-6 other customers there. Drank some solid beers and left. Nothing too interesting other than this.

This place is awesome. Nice staff, fantastic selection of beer both on draft and to go, and an all around good atmosphere. There's an indoor drinking area as well as an outdoor garden to enjoy the multitude of beer options. Not to mention there are food and snacks if you're hungry. I spent a good three hours here just drinking and hanging out. A great spot in Brooklyn, I highly recommend it to anyone in the area looking for a good selection of beer and a solid way to start out the evening.

We went earlier today, grabbed a beer each. Delicious. I had the LIC visceral emotion. My husband had the other half mosaic + motueka.

Great beer selection. Ample seating. Chill vibe. Nice place to pop in on a cold Saturday afternoon, after a cycling class at IMAXShift. My husband bought a bunch of cans and bottles as a gift for his dad. We would def come back.

After walking around to find a quick drink while I waited for a friend, I stopped in here to pass the time. Definitely worth the stop. I started out having the 4 for $10 flight. The flight specials are:
4 for $10
5 for $12
6 for $14
Nothing like a nice selection to keep you going. Bartender was nice, the owner (I think it was the owner) was very polite and greeted whomever he came into contact with (not typically the case at other places).
So for a nice drink and a calming atmosphere, stop in and enjoy. But but but wait...there's more!!

They have a wall of beer! The wall-o-beer has a large variety of domestic and imports for you to purchase on your way out. I guess that's it...nope!
There's an outside seating area in the back. Sip your beer in comfort and relative peace in the back seating area.
I will visit his place again...so many beers, so little time.

While I have been to this craft beer spot many times and have always enjoyed the bartenders and wide selection of craft beers. Upon a recent visit I believe the male bartender (owner) was unpleasant to deal with. It left us wanting to leave as soon as possible. While I'm sure we will return as it is the only craft beer takeaway in the area, I will be sure avoid going in if he is around. Such as shame it's always been a great experience with other staff members.

This place is literally a block away from the Barclays Center and a great place to grab a drink or light fare  before your event.

The draft list is much more reasonably priced at St. Gambrinus and the selection is leaps and bounds better here than what you can find inside Barclays. For example I had a Grimm Apricot Rubus here for $7 while Barclays charged me $12 for an Ommegang nirvana IPA.

There is also food here and we're looking at $6 for a bratwurst which takes ~8 minutes to prepare so order it first if you plan to eat before the game. Prices inside Barclays runs you like $14 for a simple taco bowl.

The beertender also doubles as your chef and was super friendly. There are tables along the front and the back including seating in the backyard or right at the bar. When I walked in at 7pm on a Friday night before a Nets game I thought it was packed since everyone congregated near the front but the back tables were still empty. The beer selection to go is also priced competitively for a smaller store in NYC and the selection is definitely very diverse. They even had a beer I've been searching for just sitting on the shelves: The Mikkeler Beer Geek Brunch

Love this place. My boyfriend and I make weekly trips here to pick up beers, and sometimes we'll stay in the store or in the garden out back. They have a wide selection of more obscure/hard-to-find bottled beers and roughly 13 drafts on tap, including lots and lots of IPAs to choose from (even though I personally don't love IPAs). I discovered my new favorite beer, Sophie, here. They also do flights and snacks, but I haven't tried any yet.

Big plus: the bartenders are always very friendly!

This place may be in the Bermuda Triangle based on the fact that after spending three hours there, my Yelp app still said it couldn't locate me (although my Google maps app knew right where I was).   So I was not ever able to ""check in"" on Yelp but I do recommend that you ""check out"" this place!

Came here with beer club and we really had a nice time.  The owners are super nice and know a lot about beer.  They had a great variety on tap (16 different types) and i found a lot of unique stuff that I hadn't had before, plus a few old favorites...like Mad Elf, my favorite holiday beer!

The bites they have to eat were tasty (my group ate a lot of the grilled cheese) and service was excellent throughout the evening.

This place is ridiculously easy to get to from anywhere since it's a block from the Atlantic Ave/Barclays Center subway stop.

If you live anywhere in NYC, you should get here and if you live in Brooklyn, you have no excuse not to be here at least once a week.

Hop on down to Atlantic Avenue and check out this gem.

Beer Stop 123

I came to St Grambrinus during a long layover at JFK. I honestly wish the layover was longer! This place was awesome - it kind of has a wine bar feel to it, with a super awesome back patio area.

First thing, the service was awesome. I had a small suitcase with me and the bartender immediately asked where I'm from, what kind of beer I like, etc. She provided several recommendations (both on draft and in bottle) for stuff I can't find in San Diego. She really knew her stuff and the recommendations she provided were awesome.

St Gambrinus only has 16 beers on tap, but the tap list is well thought out. They have some weird, obscure stuff on that you can't find anywhere else.

Can't wait to come back.

Great neighborhood spot to grab a beer. Super comfortable inside and always inviting.

If you enjoy tasting different types of beer, this is a good place to go. They also have food -- grilled cheese sandwiches and a few other snacks. Recommended is you are in the area.

Great beer shop! They have about twenty drafts on tap and a huge selection of bottles and cans with many options I haven't seen elsewhere. They had beers from Sand City, Other Half, Barrier, and more on tap. There is a beer garden open during the day time.

There's not much to say. You get beer, you get snacks. They served me a cold beer cheese it was primarily horseradish and who knows what else. I really couldn't tell.

Great bottles to purchase and a fun concept with an option to buy/open bottles of beer (with a fee) or select from their tap list. Seating is minimal.

Nice beer shop/bar on Atlantic right down the street from Barclays Center.  If you are searching for a quality beer before a game or concert this is a great stop.  Selection was pretty expansive with several local/NY brews and some quality national micro brews on draft.  Food menu is small but the brat I had was excellent.  Barkeep worked a wonder with the small ""kitchen"" behind the bar :)

Keep the good beer movement going and keep up the strong work!

""Drinking beer with a saint is so heavenly""

This shoppe/bar is a wonderful spot to grab a beer to stay or to take home. They have an amazing selection of different types of beer. I have not found an IPA that I did not like at this spot. I only have had positive experiences drinking here; mainly because the staff is so helpful and knowledgeable about their products.

Oh, the shoppe has a nice patio in the back that is perfect during the nicer months.

I can't rightfully say I'm a big fan of beer. Most small-batch craft stuff tastes like an overpowering mess to me, which is one reason why flights are nice. I appreciate that this place does that for us, the thirsty public. Incredibly, I went the next day to this place in Pennsylvania with something like 120 beers on tap, and they did not do flights. Anyway, yes, even I can find something here that doesn't taste like a ghost died in it.

My only complaint is regarding the loose cans for sale in the back. Many of them, I'm sure, are rare breeds of secret beer and are worth $3-4 each. However, I spotted at least one the shelf that I'd seen elsewhere for $1-2. I suppose you don't come to a shop with ""e"" at the end to save money, but then again I personally am so cheap that I once slept in a storage unit for a summer.

What a gem of a find. Near Barclays Center and a block from the subway. Quaint and inviting on the inside too. The owner (and customers) were friendly and helpful. Knowledgeable of beer and what's popular nationwide. I was impressed and brought many beers back to NC! They even had cider for those that are gluten free. I'll stop by next time I'm in town (and bring you a sour from Wicked Weed). Thank you!

Would like to give the selection here 3.5 stars.  No real complaints.  Nothing groundbreaking, but a solid spread, standard craft beer bottle shop.

That said, the cruddy rating is based on 2 major things:

First: On 20+ trips to this store I have only once encountered an employee who actually knows anything about beer.  Whether it's a bartender who tries to tell me that ""Hop Showers"" isn't an IPA and it isn't hoppy (""I hate IPAs, that one's not for me"" ""Don't worry, its just a pale ale, not too hoppy, you'll like it, I promise!"") or someone who when asked the difference between two large format imperial stouts responds ""well, they're both ummm.... {reads the bottle} stouts, so they're pretty similar... I don't know what to tell you.""  This lack of knowledge combined with the attitude you get if you ask to sample anything on tap??  Not a pleasant experience

Second: The prices are HIGHWAY ROBBERY.  I drink plenty of craft beer, and plenty of expensive, rare craft beer.  I'm more than happy to pay the going rate for a good beer, but their prices for more ""specialty beers"" are 2-3x more than any other bottle shop in NYC.

It literally PAINS me that this is the only bottle shop in my neighborhood.

Great little shop with an impressive beer selection.

Friendly folks, fair prices, and in general a really great place for craft beer lovers to go.

If you're in the area it's definitely worth stopping by. No complaints, thus the short review.

This place is a neighborhood staple that I just can't get enough of. The atmosphere is so relaxing and cozy, and I always feel a little adventurous trying out new beers. We joined as members this year and get special discounts and emails on the new beers coming in.  And love that you can pick up a six pack to take home too. We love you St. Gambrinus!

The owners of this place are so nice, enthusiastic and happy to share their knowledge of craft beers you'll need to have more than just one. Great space, lighting, and music that doesn't block a great conversation. 1 block from Atlantic terminal and a great neighborhood.

Awesome plus- they sell beer toooooi!!

Good selection of local craft beers on tap, with a few regional domestic crafts mixed in. One thing they don't have a lot of on tap is good foreign beers. There are a lot of wheat beers typically as well, which I wish they didn't do as much of. In fact, when I was in one chilly night about two weeks ago they didn't even have anything hearty up yet, like a porter, stout, or any strong ales.
The backyard space with the cherry blossoms is sweet when the weather is nice. The interior still has that new bar feel, where the decor and furniture hasn't really established itself in the surrounding yet.
I typically avoid buying bottles to go here as they're quite pricy.
As another Yelper mentioned, some of the bartenders aren't very knowledgable, nor particularly friendly or sociable. There seems to be a high-ish turnover.

Great location within a short crawl from Atlantic Ave station and Barclays Center for prefunking before Nets games. Beer geeks and novices alike are welcome here in a casual but modern and laid back environment. Nice big windows on Atlantic Ave with lots of sunlight make me feel better about drinking at 2PM.

Tap list is nicely curated with a good variety of beers and brewers. Tap list includes more esoteric breweries and brews than most other supposed beer places but you can still get a ipa or pilsner or other standard style brew.

Bottle and can selection include variety a from gluten free to international to local selections. Plus the prices are reasonable.

For non-beer drinkers, you can get one of several varietals of less accessible (and delicious) Portuguese wine.

Patio looks promising for future beverage enjoyment.

Came here with a page out of the Brooklyn Pub Pass.

The Brazen Head is the textbook definition of a ""neighborhood watering hole."" It was filled with locals taking advantage of the happy hour specials and complimentary cheese and crackers set up towards the back. The bar is known for its rotating snack availability to patrons and its stellar drink menu.

We've all seen bars that offer board games to customers during their stay, but books? That's a new one. The BH had a stand of books by the entrance for its customers to flip through while they imbibe. This is an introvert's dream!

Their beer menu is very crafty, and they also have a decent spirit and wine menu as well. They have a selfie station in the back where you're able to use props and tag the Brazen Head on your social media posts. They also have a dart board which is where I spent most my night last night.

The BH has cozy couches in all 4 corners of the establishment. They also have outdoor seating for when it gets warm. Aside from the complimentary finger foods, they have potato chips and goldfish available for purchase at the bar. If all fails, you can always bring in food from outside.

The service was warm, welcoming, and fast. I can see why it's such a popular hangout spot. I would definitely return when I'm in the area.

I would agree with other reviews.  Just a pleasant bar.  The bartender we had on this random Saturday afternoon was really cool and personable. Nice guy.  It wasn't crowded and a good spot to bring kids too, since they a little outdoor space or ample room when not crowded on afternoon days.  Otherwise, I heard this place gets pretty packed.   They allow you to bring in food from other spots, but they don't serve any food themselves. Gumbo brothers is right next door, and we picked up some rice balls and that was a nice little filling snack.  Nice little watering hole if you're strolling down Atlantic Ave.

Great atmosphere for friends. I usually go here with my co workers when I worked in the area. No Food, but during Happy Hour, they had FREE WINGS! The selection is amazing and I called and was able to reserve a corner booth on my last day of working. Definitely a great place with great and friendly staff that are always on point!

Cool vibe! Very relaxed. Nice happy hour, and great bartenders! Nice outdoor garden out back, where you can enjoy your cocktail, or one of their many beers or choice whiskeys, while smoking a butt, and not feel like an asshole. Only drawback--- no food. But you're welcome to bring in outside food to eat while hanging out! They also have themed happy hours. So they will bring in wings one night, grapes n cheese another, etc. I like it!

I have yet to discover anything I don't like about The Brazen Head. I have, however, discovered several things I really, really like about The Brazen Head:

1. Free wings on Mondays. No, seriously.
2. Cool bartenders.
3. Excellent signage game. I've smirked more than once as I walked by.
4. Good beer. Good prices. Good seating. Good happy hour.
5. They were the only bar open during that weird, intense blizzard we had that was the only snow all winter. And they didn't care that we carried in a dozen pizzas, and generally caused mayhem.

That's enough for me. Also, given their location directly between my apartment and that of several of my friends, I imagine I'll be here again and again.

I've been to The Brazen Head and enjoyed it each time. I don't work too far so it's often a place I come to with my colleagues. The drinks are good and depending on who the bartender is the play list is pretty awesome. I love a place where I can go and sing along to every song or learn a new song I can't wait to download.

There's a medium sized patio out back for those summer nights and day drinking opportunities. There's also two large sections in the front window areas that is nice for groups of about 5-8 people. There are also several televisions so you can catch a game if you desire.

They don't serve food but you can bring in food from outside. The last time I was there I saw a menu from the gumbo restaurant near by so that's one option for food.

Overall, it's a great local spot to grab a drink, hang with friends, listen to music, and/ or watch the game.

Came here last night two meet 2 of my girlfriends before heading to a Yelp event that was about 2 or 3 blocks away.

I like Brazen Head. I had never been here or even heard of it, but it's a pretty neat little neighborhood bar that isn't too hip, isn't douchey-fratty and doesn't make itself try to be something lame or overly themed. Bars that don't take themselves too seriously and are just innately 'cool' - +1.

Just your regular neighborhood bar filled with tons of publications, posters and flyers that support local art and events. Cool, I like when bars do this because you should totally support the neighborhood that supports you - +1.

Great selection of beers here, especially as far as seasonal craft brews (and even cask ale!) go. I had the SeaDog Apricot Wheat Ale, wasn't my first time - but it had been awhile and it tasted glorious.

My fellow beer-loving friend got a South Hampton Double and it was all sorts of refreshing, crisp and delicious. I also like that you can get any draft beer in 3 different sizes (S/M/L) so in case you want to try something new, you don't have to make a commitment to a pint glass in case you don't like it and this also makes for ""wallet-friendly"" beer sampling! - +1.

Couple this with friendly bartenders, good weekly happy hour specials, free party mix in a super generous bowl + a sweet looking backyard for outdoor boozing and you've got yourself a neat little bar! - +1.

I'll definitely be back here sometime!

If you're in the Boerum Hill area and need a chill place to relax with some good drinks (and FREE BAGELS) This is the place to go!

I've been here in a number of scenerios: Alone for the free bagels on Sunday because I just moved to NYC and was poor; reading by myself at a bar; catching up with a friend or two; lunch with a large groups of friends and wanting to get another quick drink. In every situation the Brazen Head is perfectly accommodating.

The bartenders are very friendly and the music is always great. Mimosas are good to excellent depending on the bartender (oftentimes there is a third ingredient after the champagne and OJ that makes it more sophisticated a drink). Very good selection of beers as well. Oh and did I mention the free bagels also includes a scallion and lox cream cheese and sliced tomatoes for your enjoyment?? Everything here is a great deal.

A dive bar with a good craft beer and bourbon selection, occasional tastings, a flexible bring-food-into-the-bar policy, and a high tolerance for annoying, rowdy Brooklyn Law School students talking about diversity and subject matter jurisdiction, the different between fee simple and life estates, and 1L crushes. The Brazen, as we affectionally call it, can be laid-back when those law students aren't out in full force and also televises sporting events.

The most notable minus? There's no food menu, so you'll have to go elsewhere in the neighborhood for those late-night or happy hour munchies (except Monday wing nights and Wednesday wine and cheese).

Wow I thought I reviewed this place years ago. It's a real old school neighborhood bar. It's one of the few bars I've been to where there's a real mix of young and old. This isn't a hipster joint at all, just a laid back place where the locals go. Beers are about normal priced but they have some good craft beers and daily specials. They even offer free food during some of their daily specials. If you're into cask ales they're the place to go for that, especially during one of  their ""cask beer festivals"".

One of my favorite features are their back patio, it's small and no frills but still has a number of stools and seats. They also have a dart board inside but you have to pass between the thrower and the dart board to go outside. I real design flaw but I'm glad they've kept the board.

-1 star because they changed their happy hour from ending at 8pm to ending at 7pm.

Otherwise, great bartenders, decent happy hours (and different substantial snacks on different days), dart board (pretty much where I've learned to play over a year or so of my patronage), patio. Great beer selection.

Gets a bit crowded on Friday nights.

I've been searching for a new bar to frequent on a regular basis, and I think I may have found just that at The Brazen Head.

Beers are all moderately priced, yay, and the happy hour goes late. If you want to impress whiskey people, they also have pours available for $9-14.

This is a rare bar that's good for groups. There are plenty of tables and a cozy booth up front that's great for a party.

I LOVE that you can bring food in, just today I saw a few dudes chowing down on Chipotle at the bar.  On Sundays there are free bagels (!) and $5 mimosas, $6 bloodies. Not bad for day drinking!

Always the go-to for me and a lot of my friends in the area. Friday and Saturday nights always seem to rig it a great crowd and the prices are pretty good for the area. The bartenders have always been very cool and attentive, which is obviously a big deal. No food menu, but the location makes it easy to find somewhere else to get something to eat.

Nice solid place for happy hour. Their cheese night is awesome. A wide variety of beer and wine. Good ambience. Bathrooms are clean and a very cozy yard for summer weather. Too bad they don't serve food. The patio is small but cozy, too bad is used mostly to smoke so non-smoker like has to avoid it.

I love this bar. Friendly bartenders, good music, reasonable prices and a great selection of craft beers and whiskeys.

What's not to love? I will be back... often.

Perfectly average bar in a good location. The vibe is alright, dark and slightly divey, and they have a small outdoor space with more chairs then they could ever fit back there piled in a corner - guess they were on sale. Went here on a date, and I would totally recommend it for that. Dark and quiet enough to have a nice personal conversation, and you can get away with only spending a few bucks for the night.

Solid drink special, $3 cans of PBR is right up my alley.

However the service is really slow. I went there on a Saturday and there was one bartender who seemed to be doing a great job at not bartending. The bar was dead and we had to wait way too long to get drinks or close out. Oh well.

Speedy and attentive service is something we take a lot of pride in, and we're confident we can impress you more on that count in the future.

I don't have much to say about the Brazen Head. I've heard of it before and always see it pop up as a place for happy hour deals in Brooklyn. It was near-ish a yelp event we were going to and I needed to kill an hour after work. They have a special every single day. Yesterday's was a shot plus a pbr for $4 and not something I was in the mood for. But during happy hour everything on draft is a $1 off and you can also get a half of a pint of something if you're not up to drinking something too huge. Kind of a neat deal. Traditional Irish pub and there is a back patio. OH! They had party mix with the Cheetos and doritos inter-mixed. Big plus because I didn't eat anything yesterday and that was my lunch/dinner. Really loved the South Hampton Double they had on tap.

Three words: free cheese Wednesdays.

Great selection on tap, even better sangria pitchers (my only complaint is that it's seasonal). Awesome beer garden open during the summer. Inside, there are large, circular tables by the windows for larger parties. Best bar in the neighborhood.

Cheap drinks, good atmosphere, and nice back patio.  Pretty good draft selection, but could vary it up a bit (85% IPA or DBL IPA).  Never tried their food, but this is our go-to after-movie place at the theater across the street.

Love this bar. They have a fantastic selection of rotating craft beer. They also have a great collection of bourbon. With sports in the tv and a back patio for summer you can't go wrong. They also have bowls with a pretzel mix on the bar. They also have a dart game you can play. They don't serve food but I don't mind that. In addition they have free wings every Monday night. Can't beat that. If you are in the area give this place a try. It has a divey feel but the beer and whiskey selection is way better then most dives.

For a bar with two bartenders the service is just unforgivable in how slow it is. The decor and seating space is good for groups and parties, but it can get a bit loud at times. Their beer of the day is always $5 for those who are looking to drink on the cheap. Maybe I'm spoiled from Brooklyn Ice House still, but I expected more from The Brazen Head.

Came here looking for a chill spot to hang out with friends. Luckily, we found a large booth and even some space near the darts board in the back. I got their current special, Not Your Father's Root Beer + shot of vanilla vodka ($9). The bartender offered to blend it together in a cup of ice instead of having each one separately and this was a really good decision. Not only was it easier to drink, but it tasted delicious and packed a punch too! I'd like to come back periodically to see what other specials they have going on.

Brazen Head is a cute local bar that I was delighted to discover is easy to find from the C Hoyt-Schmerhorn station. They had a pretty meh happy hour special however they had a great selection of beers!  I enjoyed an amazing SeaDog Apricot Wheat Ale and one of my new favorite drinks: malibu rum, sprite and cranberry juice.  That unique mix was created for me after I asked the bartender what it was and he started making it.  I actually really liked the service, the bartenders were very attentive and informative when two other of my girlfriends were asking questions. PS, draft beers come in small, medium and large sizes! Hooray! No worries about having your wallets raped here, folks (even if you don't get beer!).

My one gripe - the party mix bowls.  They have very large sized bowls with generous portions of delicious party mix but come on, how unsanitary to have a bowl out for EVERYONE to share? Do you know where their hands have been and what you're putting in your mouth? Yikes. May I suggest personal bowls for everyone or would that be asking too much? (Note that my girlfriends and I had a bowl re-filled for us with untouched party mix as per our request.)

Overall, I did like this place. The service was great and thought it was great they had daily happy hour specials.  Also, this place seems to have a cute little outdoor space.  I suppose whenever I'm in the neighborhood I'll be back because why not!

This is a fantastic bar for happy hours in downtown Brooklyn.  They have an early happy hour for the teacher which starts at like 2 or 3 pm and goes until 5ish.  Then they have the regular happy hour which goes until 8 pm.  Then they have the late night/over night happy hour from midnight to 4am.  They also have daily promotions such as Whiskey nigh (Tuesday), Ladies Night (Wednesday) and single malt scotch night (Friday).

The bar has an extensive whiskey/bourbon/rye/scotch selection, absolutely one of the best I have seen outside of specialty Whiskey/Bourbon bars.  They also have more than a dozen taps, and your standard offering of bottled beers.

There is outdoor seating on the back porch and a binder of menus if you want to get food delivered.  It's little wonder I have spent a number of afternoon into evenings drinking, eating and hanging out at Brazen Head.

I dropped in on a random Friday night after work and was surprised by how low-key (i.e., NOT CROWDED) the joint was. They even had a happy hour going, in addition to a cool beer+shot of whisky deal too, which I of course could not refuse. Pretty good combo, I must say. Even better, this place has an amazing bourbon selection! And the beers on tap are not too shabby, either. To be honest, there's really nothing I can think of to knock a star or two off this review for. Even the bartenders are friggin friendly!!!

This is an unpretentious Brooklyn pub I can roll with. Will definitely return!

This is a very good neighborhood bar. The bartenders are quick and super nice. They also have a decent selection of beers. I'm also told that they have free bagels on weekdays. When I went, it was a little too cold to visit the backyard but I'm glad they have one. Will definitely come back at some point, especially since it looks like they also host events or specialty nights here.

Don't bother going here if you have any self respect.  The 2 women bartenders were the rudest and unfriendliest I have ever come across in my life in the city. There are plenty of places to go in Brooklyn  that have a good selection of beer. As a professional who works and lives in NYC, I have honestly never come across such rude, unprofessional bartenders.
If the owner were to walk in on a Saturday evening and see exactly how these woman treat customers, they would be fired in a second.
Don't bother even opening the door to Brazen Head unless a hurricane hits and it's the only place to go.

Brunch food on Sunday. Lots of beers on tap. Just off court street in Brooklyn. Not a popular area for night life so this place is clutch in that regard. Casual atmosphere.

I've been a regular here for some time now as I work nearby. For work lunches I love their savory crepes, simple baguette sandwiches, and even the salads. Occasionally, when I'm really hungry I'll order the steak frites. They have a happy hour so I sometimes come here after after work. They make a fantastic steak tartare that I love!

I hope to see them remain in business despite this pandemic.

Love this little French bistro in the LES/Chinatown border! I remember their previous restaurant Les Enfants Terribles as it was one of the first restaurants I went to in the LES when I first came to NY. Now years later I find myself working in the neighborhood and coming to this bistro. The cr√™pes are authentic and each one is delicious! They have pretty good specials as well depending on the day and the attached caf√© is terrific for espresso or noisette along with fresh pastries.

Note that the restaurant is cash only while the coffee counter accepts cards.

I really like this place. It's a relaxed, yet a lil fancy French restaurant in a location without many of them around. You can get full service at the bar that allows you a good view of the place and outside. The cocktails are pretty good, but I haven't found one I really like yet.

- duck foie gras pate: I loved that this has a generous portion size. Great flavor and the bread is toasted perfectly! There is more pate than bread so make sure you order something else to go with the pate unless you wanna eat half of it plain.
- beef tartare: unfortunately a miss for me, the flavor is overwhelmed with paprika in my opinion
- beef rib: soooo good, falls off the bone, melts in your mouth, amazing flavors! The whipped mustard it comes with is really great too, not the usual preparation of mustard and I much prefer this! The veggies are soft and well-stewed.

Overall, I like the ambience and food is generally high quality. I find it a little pricey but worth it for the quality. Cash-only which is unfortunate.

Stopped by this cool little cafe earlier today to meet a friend. The host/waitress was super cool and very friendly. My friend and I ended up getting the crepes. The savory ones are gluten free!

Cute spot, glad I was able to check it out!

I absolutely loved this restaurant. We found out about it through a recommendation from a friend who has been going there for a bit. We had the kale and artichoke dip to share. It was light and delicious. I ordered the roasted chicken and potatoes and it was perfect for a cold winter's night. The staff was lovely, the restaurant is small and intimate. It is a cash only restaurant but if you forget they have an ATM in the back.

This is one of those restaurants that NYC used to have a lot more of, but the city has become lost in the chain restaurants and small tapas portions. It's a rare gem and the food is incredible!

Overall we had an awesome experience and will be coming back!

This is an amazing, amazing bistro! I would say that it is a typical Parisian bistro except it is much, much better. I would gladly walk from Montparnasse to Montmartre (and back) to partake. I doubt I would pass a strictly better bistro.

I live in Morningside Heights, so visit Les Enfants less than I would like. If I lived closer I would be there constantly. Naturally I like some things more than others. But I think that's mostly about me, not them. The quality of the food and drinks covers the full range from exquisite to sublime.

If I had only one dinner remaining on this earth, their two bridges cocktail, winter greens salad, boeuf carottes fa√ßon grandm√®re, and tarte tatin would be a serious candidate for how to end this journey.

Try les Enfants. Bring your friends. As much as I am anxious that it will become so hot that it becomes hard to get a table, better that than have it disappear because of too little business.

On my honor, this is a thoroughgoing delight!

I made a reservation. It started to get busy by 12pm on a Sunday so a res is definitely a good idea. The menu was just the right size and had enough variety to please any craving.

I got a savory crepe with tomato, goat cheese and arugula with an egg added on top. It was delicious. The crepe/bready part itself tasted delicious. I ate it all. The coffee was good as well with continuous refills. Service was excellent.

It's a quaint little local spot with good food and a comfortable setting.

A reasonably-priced, low key and cozy, authentic French restaurant: how is this spot not overrun with people? If you want great service, and spectacular food then go here!! Or don't because my partner and I would love to keep it our secret. 4 visits in and we're still as happy and impressed as ever.

Don't forget cash!

Still the same wonderful, classic French food, excellent and tasty cocktails and great service.  And outside to boot!  I know it is a necessity and although I live in the Bronx now I will still try to visit and dine as often as I can with friends.  Maybe they can pitch a tent with some heaters for winter dining al fresco? Worth a trip on the D train from Bedford Park for the food and atmosphere.  I hope you stay forever.

Sunday boozy brunch for power of one, please.

A long holiday weekend summons self-care to just be.  The reviews are indeed paint an accurate experience for food and service excellence.  This French bistro embodies a classic bistro in a New York environment. This business is easily accessible by F train at East Broadway station in Lower East Side walking distance on Henry Street intersecting Jefferson Street.  I am glad Yelp search enables me a good find as I was very inclined.  Around the corner there is a annex for a bakery in true Parisian French fare bakery in the front, cafe in the rear.  My male server was doing it all as a very capable, competent, able-bodied man who was ""running around like a chicken with its head cut off"" as hostess, waiter, bus boy, cashier, etc. as he was operating the business alone.  I valued and appreciate hard work, efficiency, effectiveness, attentiveness, respect and professionalism which my male server exhibits all.  My bill total $29 as Eggs Norwegian is an added $2 to the boozy brunch set price $27.  The bill is served on a actual used vintage postcard with a foreign postage stamp.

LES Eggs Norwegian + $2
Two poached eggs, marinated salmon, Hollandaise sauce served on English muffin, salad and roasted potatoes.  It was enticing delicious!  The Hollandaise sauce was refreshing as it was light.  The two poached eggs were prepared well as the running yolk was oozing onto my plate very well and fresh.  It is extremely pleasing soft and prepared well.  The roasted potatoes were good side portion but slightly harden perhaps overcooked and slightly dry which I had to use salt for condiment.  The side salad was very light and refreshing as it contain sufficient dressing without drowning.

One brunch cocktail (included)
Mimosa was delightful but contain pulp from orange.  I do not like pulp in drinks.

I substituted coffee for mint tea by Bio Tea Malongo which was very aromatic and fragrant.  I am enamored of this tea.  The aroma fragrant enable to de-stress mind, body and briefly cleansed my spirit. This tea was aromatherapy than sipping for hydration.

Note:  Cash only and there is a ATM machine inside.

This was my first time having French food. I was just in the area looking for a quick lunch and stumbled upon this place. There's sitting area and aesthetic of the restaurant is great, especially if you're looking for a quick date, consider it here. The flavoring of the food is strategic and exquisite. Good service and was able to answer all my questions as well!
Things to note:
- seating arrangements are a little close to one another
- cash only!

I ordered a lunch special for $12 which is half kale salad with a yogurt Caesar dressing and half of a sandwich with fig spread and goat cheese.

Omg. Have been here for dinner and always loved it but never for brunch until today. The brunch menu is amazing. The savory crepes made with gluten-free buckwheat flour are amazing. And the brunch menu has something for everyone. Plus great drinks. The outdoor seating is relaxing, away from the hustle and bustle so be sure to hit this place up before the temps start to drop.

-love the space, it's perfect for coming in and getting some light work done but also coming back at night for happy hour to get your pre-game on.

-food was good. I got the croque madame, very fresh and light but with all the cheese and bread goodness.

-service was attentive and friendly.

The only thing I was bummed about was not being able to order some crepes because that part of the restaurant was closed. (?)

I will be back to try those for sure.

TLDR: Very authentically French. Amazing food and cocktails. Reservations on Yelp recommended at night. Overall rating: A

2 friends and I came here at 7:45pm on Thursday to celebrate my friend's work accomplishment. Easy Yelp reservation. Do make a reservation. It was packed for a Thursday night. Our table was reserved for us so we were seated immediately. Only 2 servers working here. They tend to the hungry crowds with ease. Cocktails took a little while due to the crowd but worth the wait. Here's what we tried:

-ASSIETTE DE CHARCUTERIE ET FROMAGES (Prices vary from $13 for 2 items to $24 for 6 items): We picked 6 items for $24. We chose 4 meats and 2 cheeses. I don't remember the names of everything unfortunately. The ones I do remember are: brie, tomme, saucisson, Parisian ham, chorizo. My favorite was the tomme cheese (French hard cow's milk cheese similar to manchego and topped with honey). The honey really brought out the nuttiness of the cheese. My second favorite was the chorizo. So good! My least favorites were the young brie with notes of grass and the Parisian ham, which wasn't special to me. The only thing that was missing was a good French Dijon or grainy mustard. The board also came with fresh baguette and chopped cornichons. A

-LA MOULE COQUINE DU CHEF (Chef's special, steamed mussels + savory broth) $19: Today's special was moule frites with dijonaise broth, served with fries. I sampled my friend's dish. Very delicious broth and fresh mussels. We needed to ask for bread to go with the mussels. No bowl provided for the discarded shells. We just used the appetizer/bread plates. I'm not a huge fan of mussels but my friend loved it. B+

-BOEUF CAROTTES FA√áON GRANDM√àRE (Slow-braised beef, carrots, pearl onions, mustard mousse, red wine reduction + baguette crumble) $27: Grandmother's recipe! Tender and flavorful. I don't like carrots to begin with so can't really judge them appropriately. Very tasty but next time I want to try the steak! A

-LA COUPE DU BOUCHER (Choice strip steak, celery root pur√©e, saut√©ed haricots verts + beef-reduction jus with wild mushroom) $27: VERY GOOD! The best entree of the night! Perfectly cooked medium rare as requested. A+

-APEROL SPRITZ $12: Aperol and prosecco served over ice. Perfectly fine but the blood orange aperol spritz at Essex restaurant nearby is still my favorite! A

-PEAR BOTANIQUE (Pear and rosemary-infused gin, Amaro Montenegro, lemon juice, Peychaud's bitters, with a splash of prosecco, garnished with mint) $13: My 2 friends got this and were blown away. It was a little too herbal for my tastes. B+

-LE SPA (Gin, muddled cucumber, mint + splash of Prosecco) $12: My friend got this and really enjoyed it. It lives up to its namesake. Tastes like a spa in a glass. Too heavy on the cucumber for me but my friend adored it. B+

Best part is this place gives you unlimited bread baskets at your request. Happy hour is available at the bar only from Monday to Thursday, 4pm-7pm. This place is CASH ONLY! So come prepared. There's an ATM inside as well. 2 clean single occupancy unisex bathrooms in the back.

I'm in love with this restaurant! It reminds me of my favorite bistro in Paris. They're both casual, homey, with blackboards filled with delicious specials of the day. This place has excellent cocktails too. We will definitely be returning. I really want to try their crepes next time!

Coffee was good (very important).  I kept it basic with two eggs over easy and side of bacon.  The bacon side was amazing in itself.  First, normally a side costs a lot and you get little.  This place got it backwards.  Second and more importantly, it was very tasty.  I couldn't finish it.  The eggs cooked perfect and I enjoyed my meal.  Service was friendly and comfortable.

I came here with a group of friends for Sunday brunch and it was disappointing... I really want to love this place because of the high reviews but it ended up not being great.

Matcha latte: it was clumpy. The matcha wasn't dissolved properly and it had lots of clumps. I had to keep stirring to dissolve it myself.

Orange juice: $5 for a small glass filled with ice and not fresh squeezed juice.

Steak and eggs: my boyfriend asked for medium steak and it came almost well done. It was hard to chew.

Eggs Benedict with salmon: my poached egg was well done, it wasn't even runny. That just killed the whole point of eggs Benedict. The salmon tasted soapy for some reason. The highlight of my dish was the potatoes and salad that came with it, it was very good.

Country bacon side: for $5 it came with a very generous amount, but it was way too salty.

My friends had the regular eggs Benedict with ham and bohemian scrambled eggs. The bohemian eggs were salty and the eggs Benedict with ham was okay.

Overall, I won't come back for brunch but I will try dinner service one day.

We were in the neighborhood and came here as a random Yelp find on a Tuesday night, and were super glad that we did.  The food and service were both excellent.  The Tartare Du Bled was absolutely fantastic, and a great deal given the quality/amount.  The cocktails were quite good, and the service was both fast and very nice/pleasant.

I'd highly recommend dropping in, I'll be back just for the tartare.

This was a wonderful experience for my friend's birthday brunch. The staff was accommodating: we were running late and had to move the reservation back 30 mins and there were 11 of us. Not a problem! The interior is very pleasant - everyone commented on the mural on the back wall. Most of the party had some form of Eggs Benedict (with salmon, ham, etc.) I had the Croque Madame, which was absolutely delicious! Two friends ordered mimosas and they were quite strong! Prices were very reasonable for the good amount of food and drinks we ordered. Only gripe is the cash-only policy but their great service and food make up for it. Plus there's an ATM inside!

A really nice, little French restaurant in LES. The ambiance is very mellow and low key, and I love the exposed brick and super French mural drawing on the walls. The dinner menu is not very expansive, but they have very good options for all of your favorite French staples. I got the duck confit and it was amazing. It was served with white beans, dark greens, a puree of some sort, and a delicious, slightly sweet sauce. I definitely want to come back to get the duck again (hopefully they will serve the duck breast that night,) as well as to try the camembert and mussels.

Lifted straight out of Paris, Les Enfants de Boheme really nailed it with the live music, low key ambiance, amazing food and friendly server. It's everything you want in a tapas bar in NYC, but better. To start off, the space is large and the decor is fantastic. The cocktails were delicious - cheers to that two bridges. The food on the other hand is one of the best! The steak tartare was delicious, especially with the aioli and toasted baguette. Beef carrots was good, although I wish it the chef was more generous with the crunch topping. Mussels and house baguette were out of this world. The pro tip is to dunk the bread in the lovely light seafood cream sauce. The waitress supplied us with three basket of baguette which they buy and bake everyday.

The restaurant is amazing in its own way. Lots of locals. I will be back.

I was in the area for an art gallery opening and happened to stop here for dinner after since it was nearby. Be aware this place is CASH ONLY but they do have an ATM in the back. We got the cucumber salad to share and it was pretty good, but the mussels I had for my entree could have been much better. They were tiny and over cooked with broken shells throughout. Not sure how this place has 4.5 stars. Maybe brunch is better?

Fantastic spot on the LES.

Came here with my parents and my toddler for dinner on a Sunday and loved every minute. Authentically French, down to the no-substitutions rule (which the ladies at the next table did not appreciate).  Cash only.

We had the mussels which my toddler barely shared, the duck (confit that night), salmon special, and the cod.  All fantastic.

Great wine list, as well as interesting cocktails to start with.  I'll be back for another Spicy Gringo soon!

CASH ONLY! There are signs everywhere, as well as in a million places online. Again, the ladies dining at the next table seemed to have missed this part to so BRING CASH.

Live music on Sundays, we will be back for sure as my daughter loved bopping along to the music while we were eating.

Came here on a Saturday afternoon. My boyfriend and I we're lucky, we just got into the restaurant before everyone started to come in. Seats quickly filled up. The decor is very nice. We were seated near the kitchen and for some reason the lights around us was very dim, I wish the lights were a little better so I wouldn't have to struggle to look at the menu. My boyfriend and I ordered the Les egg Norwegian and Les egg Florentine. It came quick. I love that my eggs were runny. Highly recommend this spot for brunch

As a native New Yorker that grew up in the area, it's always amazing to me how the area has changed yet still the same. This little French bistro is situated in the middle of three neighborhoods. You have your projects on one side, Chinatown on the other, and a gentrified LES on the third side.

I came here for Sunday brunch and it was pretty quiet. I ordered the short rib Benedict and my girlfriend ordered the steak and eggs. The poached eggs were perfectly cooked and gooey. The short ribs were also quite tasty. I would say that the steak and eggs were just okay. The steak was done to the correct temperature but I feel like it was under seasoned and that choice of cut was a bit tough. It should have been marinated or prepped differently to give it more tender and flavorful.

As an FYI, this place is cash only. I would give them a 3.5 but a 4 because I can't and they weren't bad. Overall I'd come again but just to see what else they have to offer.

What a cute place - had a great dinner there last night. The duck confit (breast) was great, the steak was also great, and overall it was a solid meal. My friend had The Two Bridges cocktail which was delicious. I didn't care for the Pinot noir by the glass but the Bordeaux was nice. I'd definitely return.

Stumbled on this fabulous French find & I just had to write a great review. My husband & I shared a few plates bcs everything sounded so good, we couldn't decide what to have. The foie gras melts in your mouth, the kale salad was dressed with a wonderful yogurt-Ceasar dressing & the salmon was perfectly prepared atop a fresh vegetable salad featuring cucumbers, onions & tomatoes. Lastly, our server, Colin, took great care of us. We'll definitely be back.

We were in NYC visiting our son and asked him to pick a venue to have dinner Friday night. I could have not been more pleased with his selection. Les Enfants is an extremely cozy, little restaurant with incredible food! I emphasize that, as I am quite particular in what I like to eat. We had oysters, slow braised beef, duck and mussels plus a salad. The food was all totally superb, as well as the service, and we will definitely plan on returning there on our next trip to NYC. It truly is a hidden gem:) We recommend it highly!!!

I love this place and frequent, but give 4 instead  of 5 stars because there is a brunette female bartender who's not the nicest. Actually she's terrible and we always wonder how she even got hired in the service industry. She doesn't really engage with the guests and has a piss poor attitude.

I LOVE this place! The food is always excellent and the menu changes regularly. Farm to table, fresh, organic. The cocktails are also delicious and seasonal. And on top of that it's a community. You'll always run into interesting people you might have already met there. Can't say enough good things about Les Enfants!

I love the laidback vibe and food on this place. I think it is very hard in this city to create a place which has a genuine non pretentious vibe. Usually it is artificial.  This place is not.  I think you can go for a special event or to just have a delicious meal. It will work for both

Neighborhood gem!! I've been here many times for brunch, wine and cheese at the bar and dinner. You can't go wrong with anything you order. For brunch, I love the Eggs Norwegian, savory crepes, kale salad. For dinner, I enjoyed the kale salad (again, sooo good), charcuterie, duck confit. One time, we ordered the pan-roasted salted cod fillet and it was waaaay saltier than expected, but our waiter and chef were extremely gracious.. cleared the dish without a problem and removed it off of our bill. They also typically offer specials for brunch and dinner.

The coffee here is fantastic as well and there is a little coffee shop on the side for a coffee to-go and a pastry or crepes.

Great wine selection and knowledgeable waitstaff.

CASH ONLY but there is an ATM at the back.

Amazing. I can't believe we stumbled onto a magical place like this. Everything we had was absolutely amazing, from the foie gras to the mussels to the garlic broccoli. Everything was delicately prepared and very on point. Didn't take pictures because everything was gone and eaten in a heartbeat. Cannot recommend enough.

One world of warning - they don't take card!!! Bring cash.

This place is tres fran√ßais and tres yummy. Showed up with my girl around 7 one night and it was almost empty, but filled up by the time we left at nine. Our waiter heard me pronouncing things properly so just spoke to me in French, which threw me for a loop and was flattering. Cash only; I think all this camr out to around $80 but I don't remember.

We split the warm artichoke gratin, which was decadent and very salty; the saut√©ed mushrooms, which were nothing special; the toast of the day, a delectable goat cheese-fig-onion thing; and the vegetarian special, a vegan eggplant fricassee that was good, and more rich than I expected considering it was a French restaurant doing something vegan.

Dessert was the crepe cake, which set a high bar for crepe cakes. Really knocked it out of the park.

Years ago, we ate at Les Enfants when they just open and wrote an early review.  Stefan and team continue to create an environment and community with a quality and value of food, service, ambience and experience that shows he and the team put their hearts and souls into the place.  It reminds us the best of towns in France where such gathering spots create a warmth and space that draws people together over conversation, music, sports and ideas while also providing great food, wine and drinks at prices that reflect fair value for both customers and the professionals who cook food, make drinks and enjoy serving.

Today we had a party of eight for brunch.  Whether it was the croques madame/monsieur, the burgers with brie and harissa, the watermelon mimosas, the coffee.....not a bite or sip was left on a plate, cup, glass.  And Tim and Stefan provided the kind of friendly and thoughtful service that typifies the Les Enfants experience.

Just wished we lived nearer so we could enjoy more often and use Les Enfants Delices as our ""daily bread"".

Bien fait toujours.

I'm a little hesitant to write this review because I don't want  my little secret to get out-- this little bistro is a local gem that rarely has a wait. The cocktails and food are all outstanding, especially for the price. I recommend going with friends and sharing dishes because everything is so delicious-- make sure you include an order of the moules du jour. The staff was also excellent and made the meal all the more enjoyable. French food may not be what you're looking for so close to China Town, but treat yourself to this one. You won't regret it.

One of the best places I've been on the Lower East Side. We ordered the gratin artichoke and a steak with carrots with whipped potatoes, and everything exceeded our expectactions. The beef came with a mustard-y sauce on the side: it's hard to describe how good it was. The cocktails were great too--recommend the Two Bridges. On top of everything, the service was amazing. (Marion, the waitress was super friendly!)

Stop in for the ambiance and the yummy food. And to see the dancing cutie ""oppa""  bartender.  It's a surprise for this locale and neighborhood but definitely a long time coming.

This place has happy hour and a fun buy one get one drink menu (see special posted times).

I came here with my college buddy to celebrate my Belated Birthday. Surprisingly it was packed for a rainy and cold Thursday night. Given the nice vibe and cozy seats, we were warm and fuzzy by night's end. (Wines we tried: muscato, rose, and house white).

Apps we started with were bigger than expected. Both very good: Tartine of the day - ricotta and chorizo and the Artichoke dip. This was super garlicky but loved its texture and the toast points that accompanied it.

Dinner: my buddy went the usual way and ordered an entr√©e - stewed beef with carrots and onions. Excellent coloring and the veggies were soft. Beef was tender and rich in flavor. She was saving room for dessert so she doggie bagged half.

I went the non-traditional route and decided to do another app for dinner and a small charcuterie plate. The app I chose was Steak Tar Tar. It was plated generously in portion, and more of those yummy and warm toastie points. The tar tar was topped with a raw egg yolk just the way I like it. Only thing missing was some citrus or lime and maybe a sprinkle of sea salt to give it that extra oomph in flavor. So seasoning was a little light for my taste. But quality and appearance did not disappoint.

The cheese I selected for my 2 pc charcuterie: tomme and the meat I picked was speck. The tomme was a cow's milk cheese I believe and had a nice woodsy finish. Reminded me of a cross between swiss and like a nutty flavor combined.  The speck appeared dry but was not short of flavor and it was actually fine. I guess I've seen it more moist so this threw me off. Speck is a cured ham just a bit finer. I love cured meats. They have Serrano on the menu too but i couldn't swing a third choice.  Was getting really full.

For dessert we shared the apple pie for two. Make no mistake, not a portion for two but definitely a shareable dessert as it says.  Essentially pie a la mode for sharing but the crust is what makes this one so different and memorable. It's a must try.

I'd love to come back for their notable brunch and it's kid friendly despite the smaller venue and darker lighting. I spotted a basket of toys and books to keep the wee ones occupied. And they had a high chair.

Tl;dr: I literally made this yelp account to review Les Enfants de Boheme at a 5 star rating. Go check it out. It's amazing.

I had the Canard (I think it might have been the Magret de Canard). On top of a bed of Beluga lentils and sauces, the duck breast was seared to perfection, with a crispy skin and surface but a rare and tender inside. The chefs truly encapsulated the duck flavor. The lentils helped create a balanced palate against the heartyness of the duck, while the white sweet potato pur√©e and duck jus exacerbated the explosive flavors of the fish. Each bite was a truly blissful experience. For $25 in Manhattan, the artisanal pairing of ingredients made this dish a canvas of flavor well worth every penny.

The drinks are crafted with an amazing blend of flavors too.

The decor and ambiance of this restaurant blends with the food. The atmosphere draws on heavy French influences. Whether you are dining or at the bar, Les Enfants is a perfect place for a date, celebration, or simply a nice meal.

The pictures don't do the food justice due to the dim lighting.

Great spot for a date! Perfect cocktails, very special wine and whiskey selection!
There are outstanding wines that can be ordered even by couple of ounces, so, great, expensive wine becomes available to get an idea.
Food is delicious too, so one can have a bite and great beverages and all presented by great service.

Great find for drinks after work at Stone Street!

Service: We came on a Tuesday night for after-work drinks and got seated right away. Our server was very nice and attentive. She gave us good recommendations on what to try for food, wine and whiskey.

Drinks: My wine was pretty good and price was decent for $18 for 12 ounces. My friend ordered the whiskey drinks which were $16 each. Those were ok, a little pricey.

Food: We ordered the mozzarella and prosciutto appetizer and braised pork sliders. Both were pretty tasty. For dessert, we had the bread pudding - this was the highlight of the meal. It was moist and the sauce was delicious!

Crowd: Maybe they are normally slow on Tuesdays but the bar was nice and quiet. There were a few couples here and there but overall, it was great for catching up because you can actually hear each other as opposed to the loud bars around the area.

Would definitely go back to Vintry and Whiskey for after-work drinks!

This place is adorable!! Such a hidden little gem on stone street, a little different than the rest.

I wouldn't come here for a meal. It is just SO perfect for small plates and drinks. I had three of their Texas juleps (to be honest I'm not a wine OR whiskey person so it was the only vodka drink) and they were delicious! Such a perfect mixed drink. My friend got wine on the waiters recommendation and she loved it. For food we got the burrata, Caprese salad and the bruschetta. Everything was delicious!!

Service is a little slow, but a great Friday night spot!

I ended up meeting some friends here for drinks we sat outside since it was a nice day.
Once seated we ended up getting a bottle of wine the Ros√© Pellegrini nice bottle good tasting wine not too sweet.
We also gave the Cheese plate a try my friends picked the cheese since U can customize it not my strong point but what they got was great , prosciutto was good as well.
Nice atmosphere outside, very loud specially if it's crowded a little hard to hear but not bad over all service was good & prices were decent for the bottle of wine it was $50 not bad since we ended up getting two.
Overall all good place for drinks if u prefer drinking wine.

A very classy bar with a refreshing environment to enjoy a glass of red wine, have good discussion and just relax. There aren't that many wine bars in the Financial District that I know of.
Vintry by far is the best!!!

My colleague and I came here for drinks after work around 6PM on a Tuesday evening  and surprisingly we were lucky to find two available seats at the bar.

I'm very impress with the layout of the bar, lots of leg room and not over crowded. There is enough space to enjoy drinks and have appetizers or even a meal.

Our bartender was very friendly and knowledgable of the different type of wine selection Vintry offered. I kept it simple and ordered my favorite wine.

At first, I was thinking of ordering just one glass of Chianti and then our bartender suggested I order the quart instead cause it was a better deal in case I was thinking of having two glasses of wine.

They also have table seating in case there are no seats at the bar. I've been told that Vintry is always busy, but folks usually grab drinks, chat and leave in a fairly decent time.

The smell of the food literally made me hungry in seconds. I'm looking forward to stop by again in the upcoming weeks to experience the food selection.

Cozy dimly lit fun wine and whisky bar on Stone Street.  Great selection of cocktails, wines by the glass and small bites.
Honoring Robert Burns month I ordered the ""Fall of Eve"" Very tasty and blasphemous!
Afterwards, we savored some wine with various small bites:
Salmon Tartar, Garlic shrimp, fois gras with toast, manchego, camembert, olives.
Good cheerful spot on a cold winter's night.
Acoustics are a bit loud, thus you will be screaming to be heard at some point.
Cheers!

Love this little place - delicious food and cocktails and atmosphere! I noticed alot of reviews mentioned how they wouldn't come there for a meal... I would.. the quality of the food really stands out regardless of the size of the menu... but it basically has everything important enough to eat, and anything i have ever tried there, tasted the way it was supposed to - delicious, well prepared, well seasoned, with great flavors and sized generously per person.  I won't be writing anything about the drinks as everyone else has covered it pretty sufficiently - my favorite is ""harry's"" whiskey sour - I put it in parenthesis as it's no longer on the menu but the guys that tend the bar would always make it.  Delicious dirty martinis.  Beautiful presentation, service, ambiance.

Came here for a nite cap on a sunday night, situated us by the bar, I did not opt for whiskey menu but a cocktail based on a bourbon,  girl friend ordered a glass of  wine, ambiance was nice and chill on sunday night, our bartender was busy so we didn't get a chance to ask for his recommendations. I was very content w my drink and happy to call it a night!

Was happy to find this gem. They make the best, perfectly tasting/toasted appetizers and whiskey and cocktails. A tad on the expensive side but great for a date, night out!

I stopped by here on Friday and instantly fell in love. Stone Street is beautiful and I love wine so this was a definite yes. Their wine selection is huge and generously priced. I tried their jj Vincent chardonnay and loved it. We also got a meat and cheese platter which was also phenomenal.

I would definitely recommend this place to a friend.

If in NYC OMG you MUST visit this place, best customer service in 4 days!
one of the mixologist Aviva was the BEST we've had ever!
The staff was friendly, caring and treated us well.
We celebrated our 19th Anniversary as a random find on Stone Street while another establishment treated us rudely before we came here.
The best taste in food our entire visit and the custom drinks were amazing!!
Keep up the great experience!

Food here was absolutely delicious!!! Our private bar waiter (Taylor) was awesome as well!!! Music was great too (Even though we took it over!!) I definitely recommend this place!! We had a whole roasted piglet, mashed sweet potatoes, brussel sprouts with ham and salad!! The food just makes your mouth have a party already!! Taylor's mixed drinks were too good!! Let's just say that a few of my colleagues were a bit intoxicated by the end of the night and we devoured EVERYTHING!! Ha ha ha ha Overall, I was very impressed, I would definitely come back and recommend to everyone!! Happy Eating!!!

This place was an okay wine and whiskey bar. Interestingly, I think their cocktails were probably a lot better than any of their wine selection, not to mention I was given a dusty glass (which, although it didn't bother me, I know it would bother other people so I'm mentioning it).

The place is small around the bar area and for some reason they thought it would be good to not only have the bar seating but also tables at the window behind the bar seating. I literally felt like I couldn't take a drink without running into the people sitting near me. I was on a date at this place so it made it sort of awkward.

Overall, it was decent and it's a good date spot (lighting, selection of drinks, etc). It just didn't ""wow"" me like I had expected it to, given it's reputation on yelp.

I like it! Great location and charming interior. The cocktail selection is unrivaled and I'm thrilled that they offer flights. Hoping the options rotate on those.

Only drawback is brushing shoulders with Wall Street d-bags.‚Äç

Love this bar, love Stone Street, love the staff, love the wine selection - I have no complaints here, it's just a really happy place!

I brought my boyfriend and his mom here in December and fell in love. It was a cozy night, around happy hour and the place was pretty packed but we managed to find a seat.  The menu can be a bit overwhelming because there are so many options and you want to try everything.  My advice - if you don't know, just ask the bartender or the server to pick, they won't steer you wrong.

I came back again yesterday with my boyfriend and a friend who was in town visiting and while it was much slower, the experience was still fantastic.  We had almost the whole place to ourselves which was really fun.

Brad was bartending, and we talked quite a bit with him.  Really great guy, personable, knowledgable, fun.  He made us a sample of something he's trying out for the spring menu and I won't give any secrets, but I'll tell you it was complex, delicious, light, and everything you want in a drink.

Next time I'll have to go back for brunch!

I can't wait for the outdoor seating! But it's also a cute and cozy place if you're trying to get out of the cold. I ordered the tuna tartar and a glass of wine. Tuna tartar was good but not amazing.

I was planning on just having a quick bite then walking back home. I started talking to someone who sat down close to me at the bar, as well as the bartender. The bartender Diana was amazing. Super friendly and attentive. I usually don't go out to eat by myself.

I was surprised to find out that many of the people who live in the neighborhood come to stone street so often that they pretty much all know each other. Either they have already met, or they try to become friends with the people they don't know. So that was pretty cool in a weird way.

I would love to try something else on the menu and will definitely come back.

This is my to go bar when in Stone Street. I really love the decor, the wood work is amazing. It's elegant but cozy at the same time.
This is a bar for true wine lovers and or whiskey lovers.
The wine and whiskey list it's more like a real menu then a list. The bar also offers tapas style food items.

Was looking for a cheese plate and this one gives you all the flexibility. Ordered two cheese and one meat from charcuterie list. Yummy Manchego, very nice Jamon, and enough mainstream choices for an uneducated pallet like mine. Got the Gingerade 2.0, which is a must for any fan of the Moscow Mule.

Lots of other restaurants around if you don't like the fussy menu.

This place is cute inside and seating is also available outside. It will satisfy a wide selection of palates with wines, whiskey, and cocktails. It's a place where food is also curated well.

I visited this place with some friends and the vegetarian, meat eater, and pescaterian all found something they liked. The truffle mushroom cavatelli is worth it and a good size. The papas were not bravas but still good potatoes. The octopus salad was also good but nothing extraordinary.

I don't drink anymore, but I came here to catch up with a small group of friends. I was only lightly shamed for not ordering a drink (nothing in the menu is non-alcoholic) by having multiple employees ask multiple times if I wanted to order a drink, and one server walking away with a dismissive sniff.

If you want a surer bet, stick to the wine or spirits and avoid the cocktails (a friend said theirs tasted like juice). Another friend had an issue with a dusty glass. But they were attentive with refilling our waters, which I appreciated.

I ordered the goats cheese and asparagus omelette, which surprisingly worked and the egg wasn't too heavy.

The service was good and the food came out pretty fast.

A quiet intimate setting. Nothing fabulous but a solid choice for the area.

Love coming here on a Friday after work right before I head home. The selection of wines is nice however I'd like to see more champagne glass offerings, as there are far too few and many women tend to like champagne. My server, Miguel, was super friendly and made me cocktails with champagne that weren't even on the menu! Perfect spot for a date or to hang out with a group of close friends. I'll be making many happy returns!

ATROCIOUS CUSTOMER SERVICE. DO NOT EAT HERE IF YOU HAVE ANY DIETARY RESTRICTIONS. I am a pescatarian and ordered garlic shrimp. No mention of meat in the dish. It arrives, I have one bite and taste meat likely beef. I haven't eaten beef in 15 years and there no NO MENTION OF THIS ON THE MENU. WHY WOULD YOU PUT BEEF IN A GARLIC SHRIMP ESPECIALLY WITHOUT MENTIONING. I called it took several minutes for me to even get an answer and the ""manager"" was barely sorry. Honestly unbelievable in this day and age. I used to go here frequently and will NEVER be back.

Planning on brunch in FiDi? Then here is where you will want to be! Great food, friendly staff, and awesome atmosphere!

Came here for brunch at noon on a Sunday and it did not disappoint one bit. I'll let the photos of the eggs benny smoked Canadian bacon hollandaise and the brie du pommier and jambon de bayonne  along with mimosa speak for itself.

Very cool place with great drinks, good charcuterie, and awesome service.
Went there with my husband and the atmosphere was perfect, low lit, casual but fancy.

It's pricey but not crazy, it's worth the price. Unless you're starving and looking for a big meal. Maybe grab some drinks and some appetizers here and go somewhere else for dinner.

One of the seemingly few spots that's open on a Sunday evening in the downtown area. Great decor, fresh and delicious small plates and desserts. We loved the sliders and charcuterie. I rarely drink but tasted a lovely cider. I had espresso instead, which was perfect with the caramel popcorn ice cream Sunday dessert.

Absolutely love this place! I've been a patron here for 8 years! And let me tell you that, they are good people all around! Drinks are amazing! Food is great! And the Whiskey selection is some of the most expansive I've seen in NYC! Their prices for certain single malts are very fair, compared to other places! Always clean, the music is always cool, and it's always familiar faces here! When you do right by your patrons, they are loyal! This place is like a little hole in the wall and compared to the other establishments on Stone Street, it's a very mature crowd, not necessarily older, but mature; I've yet to run into a belligerent or overly obnoxious patron here! Keep up the good work!

The ""Muddled"" Old Fashioned is the best I've ever had, and I suggest people try it once, that usually gets them hooked!!

This is a wonderful place full of wonderful memories for me and my significant other. :) Vintry has an amazing wine and whiskey selection and hands down, the BEST whiskey sours in Manhattan. Actually, their whiskey sour is technically a ""Boston sour"" because they add a frothy egg white and brandied cherries to it.

I don't even usually like whiskey drinks, but I can easily drink 2-3 of these in one sitting. (Much to the chagrin of my waistline and my wallet.)

This is a wonderful place for a date, special occasion or ""just because"". Also, they keep some kind of rare and expensive wines open behind the bar that you can try by the glass -- not a lot of places do that!

I love you, Vintry.

Firstly, what a great bar! The staff is attentive and both the wine & whiskey selections are outstanding, not to mention the cocktails with house made mixers.

During the warmer months, outdoor seating is available in the shared environment with the rest of the Stone St establishments. Indoor seating is cozy and comfortable. Music selection is very good, especially for conversation.

Food is small plates of well designed and prepared selections. We had both the octopus and the lamb ragout and both were brilliantly done.

Good spot for the area, though you can do better in New York. My friend and I split the Baby Kale Salad and both of us had the Truffle Mushroom Cavatelli. The salad was fine, nothing remarkable. The cavatelli was decent. The pasta itself was cooked just the right amount. But the dish was a bit too oily and could've used more flavor. I did enjoy the ample amount of mushrooms on it though. If I were forced to eat on Stone Street, I would pick Vintry with its great ambiance and smaller plates. But if I weren't forced to, then I'd eat outside the Stone Street area.

Have been here two Fridays in a row with husband and coworkers. The second time we saw a cockroach crawling on the table. GROSS.

::Ambiance::
A modern looking wine and whiskey bar with high chairs.

::Food and Drinks::
We had short rib sliders and Truffle mushroom cavetelli. They were very good. I had wine and cocktails. They were pretty good.

::Service::
The staff was pretty mean by telling us to sit with a couple (a table can fit 6 people), while there was an empty table in the front, when we told her we were party of 3 and +1 later on.

I don't think I will visit this place again.

Been here a couple times when I met people after work. Located in the charming Stone Street area, this place gets packed very quickly. The first time I came here I got drinks and a bite. The wine selection is pretty decent. The food however is definitely overpriced, especially for small plates. I had the truffle mushroom cavatelli and it was quite lacking in truffle flavor and the sauce tasted kind of bland. My friends had similar lukewarm feelings about their food.

The second time I met a friend just for drinks and we had glasses of wine. They weren't great, and we ended up not even finishing them.

Not a place I'd put in my rotation.

One of my fave joints in Fidi for cocktails and wine. This spot is wedged in between all the loud rowdy pubs of stone street. They have outdoor seating but we decided to sit inside instead. Unlike neighbor Ulysses, this place is classier and has a nice vibe. The leather low back seats are super comfortable. The nosh offerings are pretty tasty. Cocktails here are excellent. There's a great wine selection separated into different regions and categories. Last night, our party had four bottles of this cabernet. We ordered their version of fries which is like potatoes bravos. The meatballs were pretty good. Pork belly sliders were good although I'm not a big pork belly fan. Burger was tasty! As the night went on, other friends showed up and we switched to cocktails. We all ordered different versions of negroni in honor of negroni month. Negroni was ON POINT!

Very classy place, the waitress, Caroline..?  was the best! Despite the ridiculously loud music and drunken bankers bantering, she heard every word we said. The service was superb!
For starters we had the tuna tartar. It had very nice unexpected flavors and melted in my mouth. Followed by the shrimp with white beans. Simple, yet filling and a tad spicy. I also tried a house cocktail: Oaxatan Fix. It has an interesting combination of flavors, which I thoroughly enjoyed and finished spicy from the tequila. They also made excellent margaritas.

I would go again for a special occasion!

Characterized by heavily dimmed lights, wooden tabletops, great music and a Prohibition Era server dress code, with an alcohol menu as thick as a Dan Brown novel; Vintry is truly a gem in the Financial District.

Upon my first visit, I tried a cocktail and two different Reds.  Off the shaken list, the ""Cameron's Kick"" was very nice.  Just enough nutmeg on top, with a zesty lemon undertone, the cocktail was well balanced, and went down smooth.  Most of the mixed drinks are whiskey based and it took me a long time to decide-they all sound bound for greatness on the palette.  The wines are served perfectly; in high quality and proper glasses.  Californian Pinot Noirs come in a massive and wide rimmed long stems that allow you to enjoy the divine bouquet.  The list itself is expansive, much like the scotch and whiskey chapters.  Its hard to not find something that you will enjoy.

Food at Vintry is limited.  The tapas styled menu is one small page and quite expensive.  My friend and i split two cheese plates, a burger and prawns.  The prawns are OUT OF THIS WORLD!  The sauce alone on these damn crustaceans required me to use the Lord's name in vain.  It is just so delicious and savory; exhibiting a wide range of spices and flavor that give it a bit of a kick, i highly recommend ordering.  I wanted to throw all my lady like manners aside and lick the plate clean.  I cant get over it-fantastic prawns.  The cheese slices are small slivers; however, it is also served with apricot preserves, nuts and bread.  The bread that comes with is a thinly sliced baby loaf with sweet raisins baked in-truly delightful when paired with a soft cheese, piece of apricot, and full bodied red.

Service at Vintry is extremely attentive, i was very happy upon my first visit and will surely return soon.  The mouse in me just wishes they gave more cheese!

Do you ever go into a bar/restaurant and feel like you are going home? This is what it feels like to visit Vintry, like home. I'm a frequent Yelper, but an infrequent reviewer, so I hope this review does not come off as hyperbolic, but I just had to share the love. This place is so cozy, warm and inviting. The staff are a pleasure to be around. The location is on a such a cute little enclave, Stone Street. I highly recommend visiting if you haven't. I always have a wonderful time here.

Had a great time, pre anniversary and birthday celebration.   Service was awesome, food was awesome, and the staff was educational, friendly, and fun to be with for a fun occasion.    Custom flight of whiskeys, special drinks for my wife, and great food!   Aviva was awesome as a mixologist, as a host, and great time.   Thank You!

Got takeout from here today. The owner is super sweet and offered free coffee for waiting guests. Their chicken parm sandwich is big and juicy, and the grilled octopus is a smoky perfection. They source the stuff from Octopus Garden, a super legit local fish market, and it definitely shows. I would eat it all again right now if I could.

Also their desserts look bomb! They have NY cheesecake, cannoli, and even mud cake.

I'll be back to try the pies very soon. Hope they make it through these difficult times!

Went for in person dining during COVID. My first time out so was a little nervous to eat in public without a mask. They were great. All servers had their masks on properly (over nose and mouth) and kept their distance when coming to check on us. Tables are well spaced so it felt safe and clean. The food was amazing. It's like the chef poked into my head to see ally favorite dishes and made them all. Had the clams to start with the lobster ravioli as a main dish and Tiramisu for dessert. Delicious! Plan to come back again and will bring my parents when they can travel again post-pandemic.

Wow this place was actually amazing and very accommodating. I would definitely return. I called ahead to make a reservation for rooftop on a Saturday night at 930. They texted me with a reminder. Before even ordering I could smell the food and I couldn't wait to eat. I ordered calamari for an appetizer and the Blue Crab ravioli for a main. My partner ordered the kale salad with salmon and a pizza. DELICIOUS! The waiter was great the food, drinks, and ambience was fantastic! Highly recommended. Great work during Covid.

Thin crust, fresh mozzarella.. I only order Margherita's. Only exception, is sometimes I'll have them add fresh or roasted garlic. 1 time I got caramelized onions, which also meshed well.
  Perfect cheese to sauce to crust ratio.. just right in every way. Only critique is I wish they offered a larger sized pie on the menu than the 12"" & 16"" inch.. perhaps a 20""  .... Other than Di'Fara's on ave J, this is my new favorite.

Coming through day long presentations our crew needed some sustenance to maintain our focus. Luckily this beautiful place is located near us so we ordered some of their classics.

The dough is so light and yet crispy with the right amount of doughy-ness. The toppings especially the pepperoni and sausage taste exactly like that: the pure essence of meat. Not super preserved or grocery store level quality. This is the real deal.

We had the pizza for takeout but I can only imagine how amazing it is in store! Keeping churning out great 'za!

Been ordering weekly from Graziellas for 3 years. I live two blocks from their location, used to order online through yelp but they just discontinued that arrangement. Their own website purported that 2 blocks was too far for a delivery but finally found a delivery outfit willing to make the long-range 600ft drop-off. Made an order. 2 hours later called to enquire and they had 'missed the ticket'.  Good luck Graziellas, I'm nothing to you today but there's a long winter ahead and your accountant will miss me.

First stop in NYC and we needed some
Italian food in Brooklyn near our air bnb. This place was a everything we could have dreamed of: loud, bustling, and delicious. The chicken parmigiana was the best I have had in my life. I woke up this morning still thinking of it, that's how good it was! You won't get NY style pizza here as it's a very thin crust, however they bake it in their wood fire oven so it still does not disappoint. We didn't try any but make sure to hit us their bakery display and gelato on the way out.

Beautiful Italian restaurant.this place is eloquently made the inside and outside. I hate that fact that they don't give bread anymore unless you ask. The waitresses were very nice and accommodating they were gettin saoked tryin to bring us out food i felt so bad. The rain started comming down so hard out of no where. On that note we couldn't really enjoy our food we ate alittle and decided to take it to go. The food was very delicious and portioned well. I had the shrimp penne and omg god it was so tastey , it could of been a little more salt but maybe not I dont need high blood lol. The problem i had with ny penne is the srlhrimp it was like 4 or 5 wish it was more and they weren't that big,therefore it should have been more but overall it was good. I didnt get to taste everyone else dish but i did taste my boyfriends , he had crab ravioli and that was great unfortunately you only get 4 but they were very big and tastey also.my mom stuff shrimp and his mom chicken parm look so good and they said it was very good. Even the presentation was grand. They had a selection of wines and spirits, but I stuck to my old faithful ginger ale. I will definately be returning so I could actually sit down and enjoy my food. Its hard when you have to rush your food and then take a to go bag. Yes let me not forget the prices qerent bad either they range from 18 to 25 maybe more i didnt look at the whole menu im sure the seafood probably was more. This restaurant could be reccomended as a night out with the family ,friends or a date its a all around nice place.

One day in September, I was craving Italian and decided to search Yelp for some authentic Italian restaurants nearby. I found Graziella's, look at their reviews and photos & told my boyfriend let's head there.

For appetizers, we decided to step out of our comfort zone and order the baby octopus. It was very chewy but very good.
For the entree, I ordered the linguine Fra Diavolo- which came with shrimp, mussels, clams and calamari. I took a chance because I've never eaten mussels and clams. My boyfriend went with plain ole spaghetti and meatballs. I really really enjoyed my meal and it has become my regular each time I returned. Their penne a la vodka is delicious as well.

When we recently went in January, we ordered fennel shrimps as an appetizer and they were definitely appetizing.
Their food is very enjoyable. The staff is always welcoming. I'm very glad I found this restaurant and it is far from disappointing, I would definitely recommend!

Graziella's is always a great time. The servers are always friendly and welcoming and the food.....is so so good. I always try a new entree  when I come in addition to sharing a pizza. The margarita pizza is a constant when we come here. The crust is thin so it's not overpowering with dough, and the sauce and cheese are packed with flavor.

This time I got the lobster and crab tortellini, and I almost asked for another to take home. It was so fresh and the sauce that it came in was buttery and creamy with whatever addictive flavor. Most importantly, they give you a lot so you're not hungry after, but my greedy self just wanted more for the next day.

When you come, you can get any entree and enjoy it, but my favorite after coming here 10 or more times is now the lobster and crab tortellini!

Size of pizza for 27$ is a joke. Tiniest dough looks like they were out of dough. No pizza sauce. They saved on all ingedients. Do Not order if you do not want to be disapointed. I ve been travelling to Naples few times, it should not be like that. It is a Joke. Was hesitating 1 star or 2 star and put 2 star because when i found some sauce on pizza it was ok and was almost no burrata but when i found it with microscope it was ok.

Sometimes for work I have to order 20-30 pizzas for pick up so it is safe to say I am a trusted authority on the topic of pizza. This my friends, provides not only high quality food but also service.

We ordered 20 pizzas and kind of needed them in a rush. Tall order, am I right? Anyway, Graziella's rose to the occasion and shattered expectations by making all of them in 30-40 minutes. These are high quality wood fire pies people! To make that many that fast and have them tasting better than any other slice in Brooklyn is nothing short of incredible. We also had some gluten free pizza as well which is not really my thing but now you can bring your gluten free tinder date here.

To top it all off, the owner Vito greeted me and thanked me for the business. He even threw in a few cannolis as a thank you. It could not have been a more welcoming environment. The food was fantastic, the service was great and the pizza even tasted good the next day. That's right, I brought some home. Next time I'm in the area I will 100000% be going back. If you don't at least give this place a try you're blowing it

Came here for an impromptu dinner with two people.

Highlights of the meal: We sat upstairs on the roof, the octopus appetizer was cooked perfectly and the cucumber spritz was very refreshing.

The rest of the food was just okay. We ordered the  pasta special - the duck ragu, shrimp parmagiana and the orecchiette with broccoli rabe and sausage.  All three dishes were lacking in flavor and they took a long time to come out. Overall, the service was pretty slow.

Skip having a meal here. I would only suggest sitting upstairs when the weather is nice and drinking a spritz.

Amazing, Graziella's is the closest you'll get to a place that has amazing pasta dishes, calamari & pizza.

- Must try the Calamari, Rigatoni pasta, Raspberry Cheesecake (small, expensive but taste so good) & Meat pizza
- Restaurant areas small from the outside but has seating for ~60 people with seating upstairs & downstairs
- Tends to get crowded on weekends, late night or holidays
- Staff is friendly & food is ALWAYS consistent
- I usually order take out to avoid waiting for a reservation & the food is as good as when sit in

Not that many good if any Italian restaurants in this neighborhood but if your looking for one. COME HERE, you will not regret it

Amazing staff and great good. I placed a delivery order thru Postmates and it came with an issue. Postmates Customer service may suck but Graziella's personally handled the issue and delivered a new piping hot pizza within 15 minutes. Accidents happen but it's what happens in the end that matters. Thank you so much for a delicious dinner!! The gluten free pizza was great and I will be ordering again from the restaurant itself!

This is a lovely restaurant near my alma mater. I try to get there whenever I'm in the neighborhood.
On the most recent visit, my friends and I shared a pizza and had cocktails. Everything was good, the thin crust pizza is perfection. It is a family friendly restaurant and not very big, so if you were going out for a date night, you might want to go a little later in the evening. It gets loud when families with kids are in full force. Staff is very friendly.

Graziella was one of my fav neighborhood family restaurants for 25 yrs. It's the 3rd time Ive eaten there since covid allowed outdoor seating. Each time the food is not up to par. I didn't really want to go yesterday but one of few places that has enough social distancing in Fort Greene and a friend insisted.  So yesterday had brunch with friends- like I said plenty of room for social distancing but mediocre service and frozen drinks watery with lil alcohol. Waiter partially forgot order and acted rushed. I usually order calamari, stuffed clams and seafood entree. It was all bland very little seasoning except too much salt on bread. Anyway I just can't eat there again, and I wish it wasn't the case.

I organized a celebratory dinner for about 25+ high school students and adult chaperones at this place and I really have to commend the restaurant for handling it so nicely. They were very easy to communicate with over the phone - I spoke with the owner Gino, and he seemed friendly, and was present the night of the meal and lovely then as well. When I called to confirm our reservation the woman picking up the phone knew about it without needing to find a manager so that was re-assuring. When we arrived our tables were ready, and our waiter (Edwin?) was super nice and generally great throughout the meal. I didn't need to pre-pay, but a standard gratuity was included on our final bill, which feels very fair for a large group. I had asked the waiter if it was possible to make a separate check for alcoholic beverages if any of the adults chose to drink, and while it didn't end up being necessary, he seemed happy to do it. Also, I had apparently miscounted the number in our party and they accommodated us by adding more tables/chairs, and were friendly about it to boot.

I ordered salad and pizza for the group and the food came out in reasonable intervals and was actually delicious! I would totally come back here for pizza, and would venture to try other things off the menu as well. For groups without children they apparently have a rooftop terrace that they use during the warmer months, but I didn't get a chance to see it on this visit. I would definitely use this place again the next time I need to organize something for the kids (if they'll have us), and I would also happily return to sit outside on a date/girls night.

Delicious, delicious, delish!  Granted, I've only ordered delivery, but Graziella's is my first choice when ordering take out. Normally I order a dozen baked clams, the clams - pancetta pizza, lasagna, lemon chicken, and limoncello cake.  Yup, that's my normal solid delivery order, and I ask them to hold the carbs.  They never disappoint.

The other night I called for delivery and the hostess who helped with my order took the time to jog my memory of my usual order since it had been a while. I ordered the clams-pancetta pizza, lasagna.   When it came to dessert she suggested  try something different.  It didn't take long for me to agree with the tiramisu.

When it comes to all around comfort food, this is the place to satisfy your needs.  The staff is patient, friendly, and outgoing.

Delivery comes with lighting speed, presenting hot food from polite and presentable delivery messengers.

I'm a happy stuffed bird, and shall you ever crave some kicking Italian food, pizza from a wood burning brick oven, then Graziella's is the place.

Most of the best Italian food places are concentrated in Little Italy and Bay Ridge, but this is a good option on this side of the borough. The plating and presentation is nice but the food itself is just average. Especially considering the astronomical prices. They do have some of the best tiramisu I've ever had. Pro tip: wait is outrageous make a reservation.

Graziella's is that kind of low key, welcoming, pizza place that everybody would like to have in their neighborhood.

There is plenty of dining space here, as the restaurant is on two floors, so you will never have problems finding a table here. The bar has one TV, so that if you don't care about sports you are not surrounded by an endless number of loud TVs, and if you care you can always ask the bartenders to put the game on. The bartenders are always nice and in a good mood. If anything, I wish they had better beers on tap.

The wood-burning brick oven makes a tasty pizza. The dough is extra thin, which makes it more crisp and less chewy than I would like, but the tomato sauce and the mozzarella are both high quality and fresh. This is a solid pizza. Added bonus: each pie comes in two sizes, 12"" ($13-17) and 16"" ($20-25).

The fried calamari are perfectly crisp and tasty, and the menu offers a couple of interesting salads, like beets and fried goat cheese. Who wouldn't love to try fried goat cheese?! Also, the grilled baby octopus packs a ton of flavor; I loved this dish.

By the bar there is also a large ice cream station, as this is one of the few places where you can get an ice cream in this neighborhood. Their ice cream apparently is flown directly from Italy, and it certainly tastes good. Give the hazelnut a try.

I particularly like to come to Graziella's in the summer, as the second floor has a terrace overlooking a stretch of Vanderbilt Avenue that  is relatively quiet and with many trees. Perfect place to unwind after a long day at work when you don't feel like cooking, while enjoying a pizza and a beer under a warm Brooklyn summer sky.

Pretty basic pizza place that has a great outdoor second floor space. Maybe the best thing about the restaurant. The pizza was good and the salad was standard.

Good neighborhood spot with friendly service. Would not make a special trip to visit though. The food was just ok.

Get the pancetta and clam pizza, rack of lamb, and linguini. They were the best dishes that we had. We also tried the burrata pizza, squid ink linguini, calamari, caesar salad, baked clams, chicken parm. These were not great.

Overall, good service and prices, homey environment, and good for groups.

‚ÄãGraziella's is a wonderful family location to get your eat on. We recently attended a birthday‚Äãparty‚Äã at the location and the staff did a wonderful job accommodating‚Äã‚Äã us.

The party was slated for 11:00 am‚Äã,  and the staff and tables were ready to go. The staff gave all the kids balloons‚Äã, while we waited. The tables had juice‚Äã and pizza stickers for kids to spend some time‚Äã making‚Äã thier own sticker‚Äã‚Äãr pizza's. Afterward, small inidivauls pizza crust came out and kids were allowed to make their own personal pizza's with ingrediants that were brought out directly on the tables. After the kids pizza's were made, the staff took them and we were entertained by a magician.

Once the magician was over, the kid's pizza was brought‚Äã‚Äã out‚Äã. For adult,‚Äãs we have oun regular‚Äã size pizzas which‚Äã‚Äãc were delicias and a trio of salds that were scrumptious‚Äã. Lastly, the bar was open, and it allowed the parents to get a drink in while the kiddies were entertained.

All in all, Graziella's was an excellent place to host a kids party. I would recommend‚Äã to anyone in the area to ‚Äãhave an open mind and allow this place to host your next party.

Full disclosure - we tried to go to LaRina first, but the wait was just too long. Graziella's has been on my list since moving to Brooklyn a year ago, so I was excited to try due to all of the amazing Yelp reviews. As soon as we walked in, we knew that this was where we needed to be! Old school, chill Italian restaurant setting. It was crowded around 8 on a Saturday, but we were still able to sit immediately. We wanted so many things on the menu, but went with the rigatoni alla norma and chicken parm with a side of penne alla vodka. I always hesitate to get anything in a red sauce from a restaurant I haven't been to before, but I just had a good feeling here - it was incredible! The real star though - the penne alla vodka. Probably the best we've had in a while. Cannot wait to come back and try additional dishes!

I am so glad I found this place. I love Italian food and have not been able to find a good place since La Traviatta closed. Service was excellent from the time we walked in. Drinks were bomb - I had an eggnog martini. My husband had veal parmigiana and I had shrimp parmigiana. We both cleaned our plates - delish! Lastly, music and atmosphere had a down home vibe. I'll definitely be back.

This little neighborhood spot feels like a family owned restaurant. There is plenty of charm and years of collecting things. The spaghetti and meatballs and sausage was okay. The pasta was al dents, the balls were moist and pork was tasty. The sauce was fresh and light. There wasn't anything too special about this dish.

We enjoyed some wood fired white pizza with Broccoli Rabe and Caramelized onions. The crust was crispy and toasted in parts and chewy in other parts. The combination was delightful.

I ordered delivery and while I appreciated the prompt service, I was disappointed in the thoroughly burnt pizza that I received. I have ordered from Graziella's in the past and have always enjoyed good service and great pizza, and I will continue to order from them, but this is disappointing.

Finally had a chance to get food from here last night and it was delicious. More importantly, service was great and could not have been friendlier, more professional or attentive. These guys are doing it right and taking care of the neighborhood. Will definitely be back soon.

This restaurants food was exceptional however their portions were small they still made the food look appetizing in to go containers for COVID. However the restaurants staff were horrible time wise and service delays are understandable but unpleasant. Would recommend if you have a lot of time to wait.

I'm so glad they're still open during this pandemic. Super friendly staff, lots of plants between tables helping social distancing and it looks so beautiful.
The burgers were absolutely delicious!

Grabbed dinner here with an old friend around 5:30pm on a Friday night and the outdoor seating area already looked packed! Despite that, the waiter was able to seat us right away. They used plants to help social distance the tables, which also made it seem like we were in our own world.

I ordered the grilled shrimp tacos and my friend ordered the battered fish tacos. We also ordered shishito peppers to share. I got a strawberry juice (didn't know that was a thing) and my friend ordered a mango margarita. I didn't see any happy hour specials as an FYI.

The waiter that served our food wore a mask and gloves which I appreciated. My shrimps tacos were well seasoned and cole slaw and mango salsa elevated the flavors. I tried the fish taco but unfortunately it was lacking in taste. The shishito peppers were pretty good but a bit oily in my opinion. My strawberry juice was good but it wasn't anything special. My friend said her margarita was strong

It started to rain and the little awning didn't help cover both of us, but I scooted in. It was nice watching the rain and catching up. Overall, my food was pretty good and the prices were decent ($14 for 3 tacos)! I enjoyed my visit here and would recommend the shrimp tacos if you go! (:

I travel often and love trying different places with good reviews. I'm also a business owner and look at different things while in restaurants.

First, chips and salsa. Stale chips and a much different salsa. Then the food. Mediocre. I got a chicken platter as recommended, my husband got steak tacos, and my cousin had a burger. The fact my plate was $23 was insulting. No flavor.

Bathrooms were gross, during Covid especially I think this is huge.

I remember the day that I discovered Bar Bruno like it was yesterday...Ok, so it was actually last week -lol. Either way, it was truly magical the way that I found Bar Bruno on social media, began salivating at the food + beverage pictures and quickly ordered take-out via delivery.com. Everything looked so good that I only made it to Carroll Park and quickly sat down before devouring the Bar Bruno Fish Tacos and my Margarita. Now, that I got that out of the way. Let me describe my experience at Bar Bruno....

Bar Bruno is a Mexican restaurant located in the Carroll Gardens section of Brooklyn.  I ordered my food to be picked-up by 1:30pm which gave me enough time to take the G train to Carroll St. Station and walk the multiple blocks to the establishment. Once I arrived, it was pleasant to see that they have outdoor dining consisting of several tables and plants around the seating areas. Bartender Sabrina kindly greeted me and handed me my to-go order that was on the counter. Scanning the bar area inside caused me to see a cocktail/wine menu near some frozen beverage machines. After inquiring about the various drinks, Sabrina mentioned that Bar Bruno makes frozen margaritas, mezcal drinks, etc. She also explained that flavors can be added to the frozen drinks....Yes to that! Sabrina made me the best Blueberry, Strawberry and Pineapple Frozen Margarita Ever!!!  Great Food and Great Drinks!

Fast Forward to 7/20 and I decided to have us come here for my birthday dinner. We sat at the outdoor table that is by itself around the corner from the other tables which made me feel comfortable. We ordered Fish Tacos, Carnitas (Pork) Tacos, Tater Tots, Side Orders of Rice + Beans, a Quinoa Veggie Burger, Grilled Zucchini, etc.  The tacos and burger were flavorful and Mango Margarita was nice and sweet. I had another Blueberry, Strawberry and Pineapple frozen Margarita like I had the other day and it tasted amazing!

Due to the Pandemi/Health Crisis, Bar Bruno will continue to offer outdoor dining as well as the option for patrons to pick-up and take-out their food/beverage orders. Every staffperson wore masks, gloves and our dining food, cocktails and plastic utensils were served in disposable packaging like cartons, plastic, etc which was much appreciated to promote cleanliness. Thanks to all of the hardworking individuals at Bar Bruno for giving me a nice to-go order and a lovely birthday outdoor dining experience!

You will find high quality drinks here! I ordered their passionfruit, blueberry, and pineapple margaritas and loved them all. They were excellently prepared by Sabrina - tasty, refreshing, and FUN.

The staff are communicative and chill people. There is a new gov regulation requiring food to be purchased along with an order containing drinks. They respectfully explained and we got habanero wings, which were very good as well.

I recommend Bar Bruno for margarita fans who want an awesome bar with fun cocktails and excellent staff.

Went to Bar Bruno on August 8th  with a friend after an intense day of shopping at IKEA. Had to wait about 30 minutes to get an outside seat due to COVID restrictions.

Once seated, my friend and I ordered. We couldn't decide on drinks so we got to taste their cucumber based frozen drink. Even though it was very refreshing, we decided to go with more fruit based margaritas instead. We also shared some wings, which were really good.

My lunch was corn and chicken quesadillas. Both were really good and tasty. Had some quesadillas to go home with and eat later.

Staff were friendly and very helpful.

Bar Bruno is an excellent neighborhood restaurant and bar.  Located at the corner of Henry & Union Streets in Carroll Gardens, it seems always busy.  Still a table seems to always be found. Only a block from my family's home, it is a regular spot for us to eat.

Enter to a busy bar area.  Tables are in the bar area or further back, away from the noise.  Sidewalk tables are available for warmer times.  The decor is modern and clean.  The music was nice.  I heard songs from my generation, which is a definite plus.

Mexican with additions of American can be found on the menu.  The food is excellent, both well prepared and presented.

My favorite is the Bruno Burrito, which has just the right mix of rice, beans & tomato.  Addition choices are available.  My pick is always carnitas.  It makes for the perfect burrito.  The side salad that comes with the burrito is yummy.

My grandson loves the Skirt Steak with fries and veggies grilled on a skewer.  They also have Vegan options, which appeal to my son.

For dinner or drinks in the neighborhood, it's hard to beat Bar Bruno.

The area, outdoor dining setup & the staff are appeasing but the food wasn't to my expectation. The food was a little bland & the Mezca tequila they use for their drink is not my preference.

So I was trying to have a spontaneous night with my friends and the waiter was very rude and hostile. In between our meals he never took the initiative to check on us and later pasted a snorky remark  saying we should've came sooner . In addition, our food were cold and insipid. I am totally disappointed.

I love this place! Not only is the food delicious but the staff are amazing. They have outdoor seating with plenty of room between the tables & chairs (social distance). The staff wear mask & gloves at all times & are all very attentive to the customers. This place is a win win, you'll get great food, great customer service and the drinks DELICIOUS! I recommend the frozen passion fruit margarita, it's so tasty. Thank me later, lol!

The food, drinks and service was pretty good. We tried their guacamole with chips which was different with nuts in it, chicken quesadilla and their Bruno Diaz Burger, all pretty good. The drinks were a bit expensive ($17) but strong, with high quality tequila

I reluctantly write a negative review during the pandemic but I really felt taken here. Dirty tables, staff could not be bothered to clean between customers? Even with Covid? Ordered rare burger which came out medium well with a slice of inedible tomato and greasy, soggy fries. Oh, and served in take out containers that are awkward to eat from. A paper plate would have been better. Sorry, but there are many other struggling restaurants that appreciate your business.

Bar Bruno is a fun, festive, casual Mexican eatery.  The bar serves high-quality drinks, the food was spot-on, and our waitress was incredibly friendly.  What's not to like?

We started out with an order of the Guacamole.  Really solid dish with unique ingredients (pumpkin seed) and spices (unknown) vs. the traditional overpowering flavor of lime, jalapeno, and sea salt (get's boring after a while, folks).  The homemade chips were delicious, thick, and extra-crunchy.

Next up, we split an order of the Fish and Shrimp Taco's (three per order).  The portion sizes were impressive and the seafood was perfectly cooked.  We opted for a side of french fries (yum) and rice.  The rice was ridiculously fluffy, with crunchy bits reminiscent of socarrat mixed in.

An all-around great dining experience.  Plus, Bar Bruno serves Pacifico on tap!  Which is kind of cool, since I've never seen this on the East Coast.

It's such a cute spot. Great for a date. The outside seating and vibes are nice and romantic. The food is great too! Service was a little disorganized but I don't expect too much considering the circumstances with Covid and changing guidelines. Loved the hibiscus margs and kale dip!!

Tried them for take out, this was not a sit down meal. The food is good, the staff was very mice. I hope to come back and have a sit down meal in the future so I can provide more information.

The one good thing is if you want delivery you don't have to use Seamless or Grubhub so you can speak to a person. Many of the other restaurants in the area are very impersonal when it comes to delivery or take out. I would recommend Bar Bruno.

I'm very sad to write this review.  I've been to Bar Bruno several times over the years and it has always been great.  The food, atmosphere, the staff-a perfect local hangout.  Sunday afternoon, I had lunch with my friend.  She ordered the pulled pork tacos, margarita and the spicy chicken wings.  We shared the chips and salsa.  I ordered the kale salad with shrimp, Rose and the tortilla soup.  We ate half our meal and brought the rest home.  Later that evening, we had the rest of our food for dinner.  I had a chicken wing and a pulled pork taco, but she didn't have my tortilla soup or my kale salad.  *The only other thing I had that day was a Nespresso coffee.

The reason I'm writing this is because at 1:30am I woke up with SEVERE food poisoning.  It lasted until 5am and it was violent and scary. I won't go into details.  I'm still not feeling 100%.  I missed a day of work.  I called Monday to let them know in case it happened to anyone else.  What if I was pregnant?  I left my name and number with someone so the manger could call me back.  They never did.  It's now Wednesday.  I tried calling back at 5pm and 5:30pm on Monday and it goes straight to a message, not even voicemail. There is no email on their website.

I know these things happen but here is why I'm upset.  No one called me back. If the person who answered the phone didn't relay the message, that is a problem.  If someone had called me back, I never would have written this review.  Cross contamination is a very serious thing especially for a restaurant who has an A rating.  Something went wrong. Someone didn't wash their hands.  The food wasn't handled properly.  I was the unlucky one. The scariest part is the food was delicious but I will never go back.

I've been wanting to go to this restaurant for a while and was very disappointed when I arrived. The service was terrible. The waiter was rude and we received no customer service, never asked if we needed anything, no follow up on drinks, rude from beginning to end. I recommend the drinks, the frozen hibiscus margarita was great, food was good but service I give a 1.

*disclaimer: this place is a little pricey - don't let the laid back atmosphere fool you* Bar Bruno was great. Quality and cozy neighborhood spot where the service is warm, the food and drinks are excellent, and the atmosphere is chill. We heard about this place from friends and wanted to check it out. My lime margarita was great. We got carnitas tacos and shrimp tacos. The carnitas tacos were some of the best ever - the shrimp tacos were good, but the shrimp left something to be desired. Kind of wish I ordered the fish tacos. Plantains were good! They had a little kick! Next time we want too order apps and check out the drink specials. This is truly the first good Mexican food we've had in Carroll Gardens!!

The lady and I ventured to Bruno for a late afternoon, New Year's Eve lunch since a handful of Carroll Gardens spots were closed for the holiday.

I'm SO glad we went here because the Pollo Loco Torta was first class! They also have an updated menu - so the photos shown here include even MORE options.

I'll start off by saying the restaurant was moderately busy with lunch patrons (it was roughly 1-1:30pm when we arrived) and there was only ONE waiter tending to about 20 (TWENTY) people. Despite the chaos, Leo was beyond courteous, attentive and non-stop checking on tables (as well as bar patrons) to ensure they weren't being ignored. Management - give this guy a nice bonus!!!

We started things with the kale dip, which was akin to a spinach artichoke dip with tostito chips. This was an excellent start and we paired it with a pitcher of white sangria. WOW, was it strong, but boy was it tasty! We didn't leave our table without making sure to down every last drop (it was infused with pineapple, as well as pineapple char that the kitchen uses for its tacos, which added a subtle sweetness + smokiness to each glass). Highly recommend, but if you're solo or not in the mood to share the same drink as your company, then peruse the michelada options - they have enough variety to satisfy any taste.

My girlfriend went with the steak tacos, and I ordered the Pollo Loco sandwich (tortas). My lunch came with french fries, but I was entirely too focused on the main attraction: crispy breaded chicken breasts stacked on top of one another with aioli sauce, onion, avocado and some other salsas sandwiched between two perfectly toasted slices of bread (hero roll). No cholula or valentina salsa picante necessary.

I knew I wasn't going to be able to box this up to go (it was NYE after all), so I manned up and challenged myself to push through to the very end. The food coma was waiting in the wings...

I don't regret it and left beyond satisfied. Major props to Leo, as well as the kitchen staff who took care of people on a BUSY holiday. They kept business going without a hitch and people were smart to be patient, because the food was well worth every penny.

Tip your wait staff in places like this. They deserve it.

I'll be back for sure (maybe to watch some rugby or soccer, which the bar seems partial to based on the decor).

Four point FIVE stars.

Why did you remodel?

Why do you allow the old neighborhood locals to sit at the bar after a few too many, ruining any sense of ambience?

Why do you serve mayonnaise and ketchup from plastic to-go packets?
It's totally gross.

I used to go weekly for a burger, taco or quick beer with friends, and haven't been back in a year.

Go back, go back, go back!  New owners?

AMAZING customer service, food, and drinks!! I ordered their pineapple frozen margarita, and habaneros salsa wings! They are definitely not stingy with their alcohol,  are extremely accommodating, and give off wonderful vibes. The drinks are a perfect combination/ratio of sweet/tart/alcohol. An amazing worker Sabrina helped explain the drinks, spiciness levels of the wings, and was extremely patient. For sure will be back soon!

I'm giving this place the benefit of the doubt with this review. Ordered the shrimp tacos and verde salsa. For starters, it's stupid to charge $1 for a little thing of sauce. Most places give it for free. The tacos were reasonably priced however. While the overall flavor of the tacos was quite nice, they were incredibly wet. They just weren't very pleasant to eat. I think that's partly because whoever delivered them did not care at all as most of the contents of the tacos were falling out. I'm assuming if I ate at the restaurant that would not have been a problem. Would like to try again!

We went here to wait for our table to be ready at Lucali and it was really a good place to have a snack and drinks.  The guacamole and chips was fresh made and had a ton of flavour.  The drinks were well made and the service was great as well.  Everything was well priced and neat, clean and I'll be back hopefully for a full meal and not just for a pitstop.

Comfortable and relaxed neighborhood bar with a small food menu.  Recommend it for drinks with friends - food is nothing special, $ 15.00 for 3 tacos on the smaller side.  Bar snacks at best.
Service is easy going and friendly -
would be back for drinks and fries or guacamole, not for dinner.

Delivery. Very meh, very very meh. I'll try again dining in but I'm a much bigger fan of lower priced Latin food in the area.

Talk about an EXPERIENCE!!!! Amazing food, atmosphere and not to mention the service! Our waiter Jonathan  was like professor x a mind reader he had our drinks filled up before asking and hooked it up with the appetizers. Constantly came over to check to see that we were having a good time and if we need anything. Our drinks were on point! The bartenders Eduardo and Joel has the perfect mixture for my passion fruit margarita and made excellent recommendations for the appetizers! Now the enteres I got the ""El Torro"" that steak was cooked to perfection I thought I was in heaven man I'm about to order another one as I'm writing this. If you don't stop here while your in town or live here your missing out!

Stopped by for drinks and apps at the bar. Contrary to other reviews, we thought the bartender was very friendly and attentive! She was so cheerful, she made me relax a little, even though I was exhausted.

Ordered the michelada (bloody beer) and a $5 Modelo bottle as backup in case we didn't like it. Never had a michelada before, but I love Bloody Marys, so I was hopeful. My boyfriend tried it and was instantly grossed out, but I liked it at first. After a while, the tomato juice tasted too watery and it was a little off putting, but that was my personal preference. I know these are a fan favorite and Bruno certainly made a nice drink, it just wasn't for me.

We were really hungry and I was sad there were only a few appetizer options. Ended up ordering the guacamole. It was unique, with pepitas and cotija sprinkled on top, but I thought the main dip was way too heavy on tomato and onion, the avocado wasn't very prominent. Also, at $11, I expected a larger portion or at least some salsa as well.

Expensive - Chicken burrito with avo $20.

Mediocre - food was not great.

Slow service - eventually stood up to get the check.

With so many great food options, you can do better.

Great spot for dinner and or drinks! All of the servers were so friendly and attentive. We were able to sit outside on the evening we went, which I highly recommend! The margaritas were awesome, we would go back for those alone, but the food held its own as well! Everything was very fresh and flavorful. Loved it! Will definitely return

Great place to get a quick drink. We had a frozen margarita for five dollars. We also got a flight of mezcal. Get the three tequilas limes and house tomato bloody Mary mix.  Great atmosphere, very friendly bartenders. Even though the bar was full and packed and the bartender is busy she took her time to explain the menu and the drinks.

Plus yelp check in gets you a $5 margarita!!

Such a neat little spot. Friends and I went to Bar Bruno around 5pm on a Friday. The interior is a bit reminiscent of a diner with retro-Mexican flare. They had great beer deals, $5 cans of Modelo and Tecate. A huge plus for this place is they bring out chips and salsa to every table. Places with free chips really have a special place in my heart.

We split the kale and poblano dip and also the guacamole. Both were incredible. The flavor of the kale dip was very, very good. One of the better appetizers I've had in a long time.

This place has great drinks, food, and vibes. Highly recommend.

Thank you for serving proper Mexican sugar cane coke and pure guacamole in the Carrol Gardens area.

That creamy roasted corn is something really special, a simple concoction that needs much much more public attention. The bar top stone cold, a quite inviting feature when coming in from the summer heat. Plus street tacos and spicy rimmed mezcal cocktails that will put a smile on even the worst curmudgeons face.

My first time visiting here was awesome! We stopped in for a few drinks a small bites to eat. The cucumber margarita was refreshing and had good cucumber flavor. The jalape√±o margarita had a kick to it and was also very good! I would get both again. They have classic margaritas, pineapple margaritas, and other cocktails. The margaritas are $12, but worth it because they are strong and made well! We ordered their chips and guacamole. The guacamole was amazing! It had pumpkin seeds in it which is unusual, but was really tasty! They give you a generous amount of guacamole. Overall, loved this place and will definitely be back!

Placed a pick-up order from Delivery.com, waited 30 minutes, went to pick up and they said they hadn't received the order because they weren't logged into Delivery.com so I had to wait. The bartender was very nice about it and offered me a free drink while I waited, but the music was so loud and atrocious I would have preferred to wait outside until my order was ready. Seriously it sounded like a club in this place on a Sunday night. Not sure how anyone could hear each other or think straight. Definitely won't be dining in anytime soon.

I will say that when I got home I noticed they had thrown in a free chips and salsa AND dessert, so that definitely made up for the wait. I'd just recommend turning the music down to a reasonable volume!

This was a great find in this Brooklyn neighborhood!

My five friends and I were quoted a pretty long wait over at Lucali just down the road, so I quickly yelped something for some appetizers and drinks while we waited.

They were able to seat us right away and we got straight to ordering. We got a pitcher of sangria, two orders of chips and guacamole, an order of chicharrones, two tortilla soups, and an order of plantains.

Wow. My friends and I were all very quiet while eating because we were impressed at how good and fresh the food was. The guacamole was chunky and so tasty. The chicharrones came straight out of the frier and were so light and airy! You couldn't eat just one, they're dangerous. The plantains were cooked well and had a white sauce over them. I don't know what it was but it was great haha My two friends loved their tortilla soup.

The sangria pitcher provided just the right amount of portions for our group of 6. It was not too sweet and so refreshing!

Everything was reasonably priced and proved to be great for appetizers! Stumbled upon it by accident but would totally come back again.

Montero's is the coolest place you'll ever have the privilege of drinking and celebrating in. There is no ""it"" scene here or fancy flair cocktails. It's an ancient dive bar that should be a museum to honor the New York of old that disappears faster than you can snap your fingers each day.

My most recent visit was an early Friday evening after work (teacher hours mind you), and it felt like all regulars in the spot. Pool table was busy, early evening news was on, jukebox was loaded up with some jams, and the owner (?) as usual posted up at the end of the bar surveying his keep.

Though it wasn't crowded, for our eventually large party of about 6+, it was difficult to be seated and not feel in the way of all traffic cause the place is so narrow. That may have been a blemish for my coworkers, but I've been here on karaoke nights when it was standing room only, so my standard of measurement is skewed.

Perhaps this may not be our regular after work spot cause our group rolls too large, but I will be back with my crew for Karaoke one of these evenings!

And for the early couple of first round drinks with 2-3 coworkers tops? Montero's works juuuust fine, and we should be so lucky to get to experience it.

Montero's! Karaoke with AMETHYST (lovely host with killer vocals). Need I say more.

A friend of ours was having a birthday and we had to trek it do some hidden bar in Brooklyn Heights. My friend described this place as ""aquatic themed"" and a ""dive"". Two of my favorite words when combined together. I salivate at the thought of an old man bar and then you put karaoke in the mix  like the cherry on top.

We arrived around 9pm. Turns out this was the smartest move. Later I saw groups of people and even birthday people get turned away by the charming door guy ""Pepe"" while ""Matthew"" tried to woo me.

The karaoke is done in the tiniest part of the bar. I suggest you'd stand in an angle to let people go to the bathroom but also leave room for ""Sonya"" to bus tables and get to the bar and still see the karaoke list.

Back to Amethyst. You gotta write down the song you want to sing. If it's not in the computer then Amethyst will call you back to put in a new song. You get a song with every drink you order. If you are doing a duet then you hand the mic to the person who's being invited to sing. This is the rule. The name on the slip is the person that hands the mic.  Don't forget. The main mic has the red tape. DON'T PUT DRINKS DOWN ON AMETHYST'S TABLE.

At the bar, Kaddy is slinging drinks but will take a quick break to sing some Alanis Morisette. Everyone here is down for the wild ride!

The beers are $4 for pbr and with a tequila shot it's $11. So pick your liquid courage wisely.

This place is over 80 years old. The staff was really the best part, followed by the decor. The crowd is a young, finance, fresh out of grad school types and some older regulars sprinkled in. Maybe they come on the non-karaoke nights.

It's CASH ONLY. Almost $3 for the ATM.

First karaoke bar I've been to, and it was so much fun! You buy a drink, and you receive a ticket to write your name and the song you want to sing. The crowd was super encouraging, cheering everyone on as they belted their hearts out. A little bit of an older crowd. Wish I had stayed for a few more rounds.

Montero's is a dive that comes fully equipped with a pool table, surly bartenders and surprisingly fun karaoke nights, so please allow me to sing this review to you in the style of Bohemian Rhapsody:

Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a dive bar, to escape from reality.
Open your beer, look at that weird guy, smell peeeee...
I'm just a poor boy, I need some buybacks please.*
Because I'm kinda drunk, OK sloshed. Little high? Maybe so.
Anything the 'tender pours, doesn't really matter to me, to me...

Oh man, just sang a song.
Put my mouth up on the mic, yelled my chorus, now they left.
To think, the night had just begun.
But now I've gone and chased them all away...
My bad, ooh, didn't mean to make you leave,
If I'm here back again this time tomorrow,
Get me help, the AA kind, 'cause I definitely have a problem.

Too late, my drink has come.
Sent shots all down my throat, think I should've got my coat.
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go.
Gotta leave you all behind and eat some food,**
Really, ooh, (anything that tastes good)
I don't want to leave,
But sometimes I wish I'd never come in at all.

[Guitar solo fades out because I think this has run its course.]
_____________

*The prices are definitely a little higher than they should be, considering the smell and the man sleeping in the corner that you might think is homeless, but is actually just waiting for karaoke to start (he has a lovely voice).
**They don't serve any, but Table 87 is quite close and delicious.

Montero's is a neighborhood staple. It's as old school as it gets - like something out of Last Exit to Brooklyn.

Come here for the karaoke machine, stay for the cheap beers.

Cash only!

Oh, and if you and your bros decide to sing Wagon Wheel, I'm going to throw something at you.

We ended up here on just another Friday night, after finding out they had good karaoke. Not knowing anyone around, we ended up having a good time and talking with some pretty great people! Karaoke was a blast and the KJ was great. She made sure to keep everyone in the order they were submitted, even when one of the girls trying to sing gave her crap about it. The one thing I like least about karaoke is people trying to drunkenly get their stuff in before their turn, and the KJ handled it like a pro.

Solid dive bar and I wouldn't have enjoyed it half as much if it weren't for the karaoke in the back. Shots are $6 or $9 depending on which bartender you ask... the well whiskey switched from Evan Williams to Old Overholt and I kind of lost track of what they were pouring me.

Like most dive bars, it's pretty mixed crowd, the bartenders aren't very nice, and the decorations are tacky as sin. But I had a great time for a reasonable price.

What an EXCELLENT dive bar! I had a fabulous time here Saturday night. Montero - what I hear is possibly the oldest bar in Brooklyn - is small, cozy, and decked out in nautical trinkets and memorabilia. The staff are friendly, and they have a good (but standard) selection of drafts and bottled beers. But what really makes this place stand out from the pack is its vibe and LIT karaoke night. The minute you walk in, the staff and clientele make you feel like you're part of the family. And the karaoke, run singlehandedly by one person, was so much fun. You know the deal: get a sheet from the bar with your drink, write down your name and the song, give it to the DJ, and wait. The mics work great, and I was pleasantly surprised to hear many good singers cover everything from Creed to Lauryn Hill.

All in all, Montero is a blast and will likely be a Brooklyn Heights landmark for years to come.

Montero's is a real, authentic old school dive bar. Not one of these newfangled spots appropriating dive bar culture, but the real deal.

It's been around forever, so if you live in the area, I'm likely not breaking news of its existence. But for those who live outside of the neighborhood who want to add a new sticky-floored dive to their rotation, you should probably bookmark and make an effort to visit.

Their most popular night is easily Saturday when then bring in a ramshackle karaoke rig that's fun, approachable, and non-pretentious. For every drink you buy at the bar, you're given a small sheet of paper that grants you an opportunity to belt out a tune. The karaoke DJ is a delight, and don't mind the fact that you'll be singing right in front of the toilets. It gives the whole performance some charm.

Drinks are a little pricey for well cocktails mixed with grocery store bottled club soda, but hey -- inflation. You can bring in outside food, and the bar is dog friendly. Two major bonuses that easily make up for any shortcomings you may encounter.

Ended up at this spot after our original idea was closed. Dive bar with friendly & hospitable service. Played pool though I'm not very savvy, we had fun! A few beers, good vibes & great laughs is one way to enjoy life. Check this place out for a nice laid back community bar.

Stopped in a couple hours ago for a quick bud run after a day in the park and I gotta say, one of the worst establishments I've been to. Besides heavy dust, the place was baby friendly but a bitchy old man (the owner I'm assuming) spoke horribly to female employees. If it weren't for the bartender with great sense of humor, this place would get one star. Seriously stay home gramps.

Want a beer? Montero's is a great place to go in Brooklyn. They only serve alcoholic beverages, but it's sort of a ""Blast From The Past"" kind of place. It can get quite crowded, but the beer is good and the bartender knows how to pour a good beer I discovered as he poured me a Guiness.

This isn't the bar to take your mother-in-law. Personally, I don't think you should take your mother-in-law alone to any bar. But that's besides the point! I'm here to tell you Montero's is your classic dive bar that has been there so long that I can only assume the empty phone booth that is inside has had many a sailor that....stole a kiss from a sweet dame. See, this place is so classic and old school that you become a person of the past. The place has cheap beers as a dive should. But Montero's has a ""low key"" karaoke scene that actually could intimidate even the greatest of weekend American Idols! I swear everyone sings so damn good! You know how to solve those fears and jitters? Yea, you know...more cheap drinks. The karaoke gets pretty full after 10:30 on weekends so make sure you get your song requests in! The bar staff are always willing to chat and poke fun at my group of yokels, and we definitely deserve all the sass they can give.

FYI, it is cash only, of course. (What is that plastic devil square you are handing me?!) This is Montero's you fool, The pride of the Brooklyn Piers and home to horny sailors(ok, haven't seen an sailors in a while) since the 1940's!

Dive bar without the grittiness.

The incredibly welcoming and lovely woman behind that bar (Kaddy/Caddy) is half of what makes this place so special. She makes you feel like a regular right off the bat.

If it happened to be the end of the night while  me and the wife were arguing and I absolutely needed a beer or  an excuse to get out of the house, I might pick this place.

The beer was overly priced ( in my opinion ) and they don't even play football games on sundays WOW

Mixed Feelings

Old dumpy bar with a lot of history behind it.  The bartender weirdly had the door locked and vetted us before he let us in.  I guess he was trying to keep out the riff raff.

This bar used to big spot for the Naval port that's down the street.  The bartender told us the whole story, almost to a fault.

Overall:
It's a cool dive bar that really looks garbage pit from the outside, but don't be alarmed.

Thanks

This place is hellish and the service is even worse. Truly don't understand how there are 4 stars.

Visiting from out of town with two friends, we ordered a round of shots to celebrate old friends. The horrifically high bar tender, Andy, initially told us our 3 shots would be 27 bucks. Then she came back and said actually it's 36. Since that was quite the unreasonable jump, at a dive, with no reason, we left 40 bucks in total.

She waved the money in my friends face sarcastically saying ""thanks for the tip!!"" (We all know you were pocketing that other 9 anyway).

I didn't see this happen and if I had I would have left at that moment. Then a few minutes later we got a round of beer. My friend paid for this round and Andy accused her of not tipping again. My friend paid for the drinks in exact change and was reaching for her wallet to give the tip. (Was she nervous in the .5 seconds she didn't see more money because she thought she wasn't going to be scoring after the bar closed?) Appalled by ANDY, we all gasped. She knew she was out of line and then tried to make up for it by sweet talking us.

Then she back tracked her all of a sudden caring demeanor and took it upon herself to explain to us that you don't order shots at a bar and that it's like ordering a margarita. We are very aware of dive bar culture. Ordering a shot is not a crime. Thank you.

Honestly we should have left as soon as Andy made that remark. I think we were all too astonished to even believe what was going on.

We went to a different bar as soon as we finished our beer. At the next bar a guy approached us and said he was at Monteros and saw the whole thing go down. He couldn't believe it either.

If rude is your thing, this is definitely the place to go.

Stoped in on a Friday night with family.  The place is definitely a dive bar; but an inexpensive, good times, dive bar.  When we walked in it wasn't too packed but within 20 minutes you could barely move.  We listed to some truly awful karaoke, had a few drinks, and went along our way.

If you are looking for an experience and cheap drinks, then this place is for you!!

Your bar must smell this bad to be considered a dive.""

Visited this place after a holiday party. It was kinda outa the way and smelled like beer and puke. I lasted less than 10mins before I escaped.

If you're drunk and your sense of smell is gone, then this place is for you....cheap drinks and drink people...plus karaoke.

Cash only I think.

Somehow, after our weekly Brooklyn beach volleyball league games, we inevitably get sucked into the late night bar allure that is Montero's.  Maybe it's the cheap drinks, or divey, nautical atmosphere....Or maybe it's the sometimes-awkward, Rick Moranis-looking, good joke-telling bartender, Alan.

Either way, we always have a good time, and consume at least four times the amount of drinks we had initially planned for.  Although there's no kitchen, there's an awesome 24-hour deli (Champion) located a block or two down the road, and you can bring your food in too.

My only experience here is on weeknights, specifically after our volleyball games, so I can't speak to the karaoke or weekends...only to the jukebox.  My one suggestion would be to set the jukebox to play random songs when there are no paid requests in the queue.  There have been times when the bar is just about dead-silent, simply because nothing is playing at all.

Aside from that, Montero's is a great time right by the pier, so if the waterside ""Bark Hot Dogs"" isn't up to snuff, or if you're looking for indoor seating in a relaxed environment, Montero's is your place!

Cheap drinks! Very fun environment and a great place to hang out! The bartender was super friendly and it is a cash only bar FYI. I'm definitely going again when I visit.

A classic example of a fun little dive bar with tons of heart and soul. I would call this place superb for the kind of bar it is. Staff and patrons: warm, upbeat, friendly. Atmosphere: shadowy, cloaking, and intimate, enclosing, encircling, enfolding. Soothing. Museum-like. Subdued, mellowed, and gentle. All the wood grain has that buttery, powdery, worn-down texture which comes from years and years of people's elbows and knees buffing all over it. A real pleasure, that.

Other remarks: I might style Montero's somewhat more of a place for hard liquor drinkers. You'll be side-by-side with experienced, seasoned imbibers here, old salts who can stand up to repeated, prolonged, series of shots and not sway in their shoes. But there are plenty of bottled beers as well (for you lightweights).

Overall: solid watering-hole for when the workaday world around you is too bright, too loud, too crazy. When the breaks are beating the boys; when you're up against it...when you're down to the very last nerve cell between you and a jail cell...when nerve is all you got left in the left-sagging cheek--of the only ass you got left--and that ass is being kicked left and right by all the feet in the city...Montero's is where you must come for relief.

Really friendly people including the fun KJ, Amethyst Valentino! She's super nice and has lots of songs, just ask. You get a karaoke ticket with each drink purchase. Cash only but there's an ATM, drinks are reasonable. Great little dive bar! So glad we found this spot.

So after a drunken Friday night at my co-workers farewell party, Stephanie was on a mission to find a good karaoke bar...  I put ""karaoke"" in my Yelp search engine and found Montero's.... Stephanie called to confirm that they did in fact have a Karaoke machine.  After being assured that they did, we made the troop over to Montero's.

When we entered, I was floored.  The place was a bit dingy... to say the least.  And lo and behold, no karaoke machine.  They guy that greeted us at the door kept telling us it was coming... we arrived at 9:30... what time exactly did karaoke start?  After waiting for about 20 minutes, we all just decided to leave.

Probably won't be returning...
...... yea, no probably.  I WILL NOT be returning.

I love this place. Somebody reported (on Yelp) that they've closed, which is not true, so don't panic!

I just called the bar and they were like ""I don't care about Yelp! We're packed every night!"" Shine on, Montero's, shine on.

I visited this bar one night with a friend and acquaintances after visiting another bar earlier that night. While vibe was good, it was surprisingly busy and crowded when we went inside. I had one cocktail while there. There was Karaoke there as well but there was a lengthy list of people who wanted to sing, so I didn't even though I wanted to. I spent much of the time in conversations while feeling nice from the previous cocktails. We left after a woman sung Anastasia's hit song ""One Day In Your Life"" which we enjoyed. Overall, I enjoyed my visit.

I live in the neighborhood and wanted to love Montero's, but sadly there is a racist bartender there. I'm Asian and was sitting at the bar the other night with my white friend. The white bartender said to my friend, about me: ""You know you can't trust people like her who have slanty eyes."" I've never had someone say something like that to me in my life. I very calmly and directly said ""Sir, you really shouldn't say offensive things like this to people."" He said, ""It was a joke."" He didn't even feel the need to offer a proper apology. I live blocks away, and when my friends come to my neighborhood, they often want to stop by Montero's because of its authenticity and interesting decor. Now I'll tell them only go if you're white.

I Love Montero's!!. There is just a really nice vibe here: friendly, unpretentious, welcoming people and nice bartenders.

My sis and I came to sing a couple of songs and had a ball. Everyone was really supportive and fun and even offered us pizza. Montero's is the bomb. Don't ever change, Montero's!

I'm a big fan of a good dive bar, but this place is really a dump...and they charge like they're an upscale establishment.  There's an old man working the bar that's pretty rude and had filthy hands like he just came in from gardening.  Had to convince myself that the alcohol would kill whatever he touched on the lip of my beer when opening it.  My fianc√© just got a Diet Coke, he pulls out an 8 ounce plastic cup and a 20 oz bottle of Diet Coke and pours a bit in the cup and says $2 (that's normal if it was a normal size drink), when I questioned it, he snaps ""this is Atlantic ave, we're always packed, we don't want soda drinkers"".  Note, we were the only customers in the bar at the time.

Let's set the stage: Friday night at a bar in Brooklyn...

I know, you're thinking slender gentleman dressed effeminately, chicks in old lady glasses, and flannel.

But actually, Montero's has a bunch of middle-aged people doing karaoke and a few bedraggled law students playing pool.

Pretty confusing, but the drinks are cheap.

If less than one star was possible that's what I would give this place. Came to this bar late in the night and wanted water. Bartenders refused to give me water and made nasty comments and used profanity towards me. Incredibly unprofessional. Definitely would not go back due to the poor treatment.

Heh-- as someone said earlier, Montero's should be landmarked. Unfortunately with the changing neighborhood the bar may turn into a Banana Republic any day now, so get there while you can.

I love this bar and I even love the hipster-yuppies that are often populating the area and the bar.

If you come here to chill and have a cold PBR and are friendly with everyone, Montero's will become your local favorite watering hole too.

Bocce, Beer and B... hmm, ah! Books!
Happy hour is $1 off well drinks, beer and wines from 4-7
food on the menu as well for happy hour.
couches in the front, the back and seating everywhere else. Downstairs you will find the unisex bathroom and another space with a bar for nights where there are performances. Parking is tough so Uber it or take the train that is one avenue away. Cool spot to hang with a group of peeps, play bocce or whatever.

Thank you to Union Hall and the staff for the great engagement party event on Saturday night for my daughter and her fianc√©. It went very smoothly thanks to planning with Naomi, the event contact, and all the staff involved. The platform in the back of the bar was perfect for the party - cozy and apart from the rest of the main bar area, and the bocce fields added additional entertainment. Food was very good as well.
Planning this from Virginia, we were hopeful that it was going to be all good, but it exceeded our expectations!  Thanks Union Hall!

BOCCE BALL!!! If you don't know what I'm talking about, you can literally google how to play the game two seconds before your turn and somehow master it in one go! Pro tip: get your team's ball closest to the small white ball without touching the back wall. That's all you'll really need to know to play the game. It will get competitive, it will get addictive, and it's even better with some alcohol.

Nice place for a drink!
They have at the back of thw bar few games to entertain yourself and the front very comfy sofas.
Service is fast and on a Saturday 5pm the bar was full but not crowded.
We were 6 adults and a 1.5yr old toddler and our kid was not a problem at all. Not sure about the kids policy. But at the entrance there is a sign that says no strollers (if you have those mini foldable is not a problem!)
So, place to either go for games while having a drinknor to have a drink and be able to actually have a conversation.
We like it.

Visited 'UH' a few days ago on a humble...
Heard a few good things but man,let me tell you this ...the space was really nice with a great vibe..
The bartender was so chill and she explained how to play the game of Bocce ball...
they have two lanes in the which I have never seen before in a local bar...
I was surprised on how much Real estate they took up considering most places would use the space for dining ..
But once we played our first game I definitely understood the method towards their madness..
Man did we have a blast...
Drinks were also great with a decent happy hour ..
I will definitely be going back for a rematch..

I came here by chance with a group of friends expecting nothing. The venue itself is gorgeous and the feel is extremely cozy. There are even working fireplaces! The prices are good for park slope. There music a little too mellow and slow beat. The french fries were alright and the drinks are strong.

Came here on a Sunday night after a wedding and it was so chill, loved the vibe -- not sure if I would still love it on another more crowded night. It was quiet and we played bocce ball in the back! Two bocce ball lanes! Comfy couches and table seating available as well.

OMG walked from corner to corner and cannot find this place! There are no signs that says ""Union Hall"" or anything and finally found it by the numbers ""702"".

Walked in and looked to my left and thought I was at a fancy library. Walked further into the bar and saw bocce ball, okay Hmmm not bad...

Stopped at the bar to get a drink and found that happy hour was $1 off of beers, mixed drinks, and wine. I'm a beer and wine drinker so I was excited to see there were local NY brews and unique ones that I've never tried. Not the typical Stella and Bud.

Since now I know where this place is, I'll be back with a group of friends!

Been coming here for years... But I'm not happy that they're putting the fruit straight in the drink instead of on the side...WTF. Not the bartender's fault, she's great, but apparently they were told they can't put slits in the fruit anymore so they have to throw it straight in...I don't like dipping my fingers in a drink to squeeze a fruit

I was at union hall recently and I witnessed who I overheard was a manager curse and yell at who appeared to be a staff member in front of a large group of customers who appeared uncomfortable after...

To be quite frank this is not the first time I've witnessed unprofessional behavior from management from union hall.

I'm pretty disgusted with this bar in general and it's vibe in the neighborhood.. this was the last straw. I will not be going back and I will be advising everyone I know not to go to this bar.

I'm a super fan. It's the cauc version of Bedford Hall, not sure which came first but I found this second and it's ok. I definitely liked learning the new bowling type of game they have. And, did Karaoke which was super fun. I'm going back for sure.

I don't review bars often because I think they can be very subjective due to personal taste in night life, but I really feel like this has to be 5 star spot for anyone who comes in. One of the only spots in Park Slope with a young crowd, the large space really has something for everyone. Lounge area with couches, huge bar, FREE bocce courts, private area for parties, and a basement that often hosts big name and up and coming comedians on the regular in a very intimate space. Really can't say enough good things about this iconic Brooklyn establishment

Bocce ball, comfy (yet sparse) seating areas, that young crowd that reminds you that you too used to enjoy drinking standing up- young ruckus downstairs and the best darn Long Island iced tea I've ever had. Also, pickle backs! A decent evening was enjoyed by most.

I very much enjoyed this bar. It has a ""professors living room vibe"" which I definitely dig. Any place that uses couches instead of tables and chairs always gets a big thumbs up in my book. The bar has bocce courts in it, although we couldn't play because there was a ""tournament"" going on (really, I think the people who got there before us just wanted to hog them and told us that because there was no evidence of a tournament - anyway, I digress).

The pricing was reasonable. The service was friendly. The only reason I don't give Union Hall 5 stars is because the food was ""meh."" The hummus was bland and the veggie burger I had was much like a million veggie burgers I've had in the past. I would recommend Union Hall for a fun night out with drinks and bocce ball, but maybe grab a bite somewhere else beforehand.

Ugh! A couples dream. This is a big place with all sorts of nooks and crannies for you to hide away in. The library walls adds a great touch.

If you find a seat on a Saturday night, consider yourself lucky. It's so much fun to sit back in a comfortable chair and watch people pass. (Is that strange, no, I don't know?)

The bartenders held it together pretty well on a crazy night. My friends drink was weak and after a comment to her, the bartender amped it up without even a question. She had a big smile on her face and appeared to want us to be happy.

The bocce is a blast and is ideal for couples and friends to compete against. It's a fun game that you can either play in or just watch for depending on how you're feeling. It's a giant game right in the middle of the bar. You won't miss it. Play a round to make the best of your time at Union.

Downstairs is a little crazy! It reminds me of a speakeasy... there was karaoke on a small stage. Of course you'd have to get up and boogie with the MC who was 6'0, bearded, and wearing a tutu. It's incredibly Brooklyn here. I'm glad I found this gem.

My partner and I came here to see a comedian, but she cancelled 30 minutes before the show. What a bummer.

We decided to make the most of the night and enjoy Union Hall for what it has to offer. A really lovely atmosphere, friendly bartender who gave us the $1 off beer deal even though it was past the HH time. Thanks!

We scored the seats next to the fireplace and in this brutal winter it was SO lovely. If I'm in the area again, I'd definitely end up here.

i came here for a comedy show in the basement but since we arrived a bit early, i got a round of drinks at the main bar. initially, the gentleman behind the bar seemed to be either really and quietly busy or meditating. one of the two but as soon as he noticed me, came up and was a friendly dude who took care of me and my friend.

the show started shortly after getting our drinks so we went to the basement. i forget the name of the comedians that evening but the show was fun. it was two ladies, so if you think that white men are an endangered species you probably wouldnt have liked it but whatever, chances are nobody likes you either.

after the show was over we came back up and saw a few kids wearing beanies bastardizing the game of bocce but you know, vegetarians who eat fish and chicken tend to fuck everything up.

four solid stars.

Union Hall has something for everyone.  Wanna cozy up in a library or a booth?  How about we play some indoor bocce*?  Or head downstairs for a comedy show** (complete with a downstairs bar)?  Love beer?  Union Hall is seriously my go-to place in Park Slope!

It feels so exclusive when there aren't any crowds but it still maintains that inviting and chill down-to-earth ambience regardless of the number of people.  The ground floor has an open layout, which I adore.  The only thing I probably love more than the layout are the bartenders.  My friend and I dropped by on a Saturday afternoon after brunch (heck yeaaah) and noticed a milk/coffee flavored draught.  Seeing our confusion, he happily brought a glass under the tap and offered us a sample.  That was so kind of him!

------

* Bocce is a ball sport played on a very long and narrow court that's covered with a thin layer of natural soil.  They have 2 courts laid side by side.  Two players/teams play per court as designated by the blue and red balls.  The white ball is the pallino (or boccino) and the goal is to get your ball as close to the white ball as possible.  I like to roll my ball to knock the pallino away from my friend's and closer to mine (hehe).  There's a fairly complicated point system that you can research online if you're interested in keeping score.

** They sell event tickets online at Ticketfly (and at the door).  Online tickets are cheaper when purchased at least 1 day in advance (was $6 vs $8 for my Battle of the Divas - Beyonce vs Lady GaGa - t'was a great night of comedy, drag queens, and lip syncing!).  I love how they have cups and water pitchers at the downstairs bar for people who aren't drinking alcohol.  Also, the bathrooms stalls downstairs are unisex so even if you see someone of the opposite sex, don't worry, you're in the right place!

A group of guys were cheating and disregarding the Bocce Ball sign up sheet to make sure no one outside of their group could. Normally I wouldn't complain about this since the bar isn't necessarily responsible for whatever jerks patronize their establishment, but these guys play on a league and clearly spend a lot of time here. One in particular, Andy, portrayed himself as a representative of the establishment inasmuch as continually insinuating himself into our game to declare the house rules, a surprise move since he'd previously failed to understand that joining his colleagues for a game even though he was clearly 5th on the waiting list after us wasn't very fair. We spent most of the game protesting for fairness and enduring a lot of confusion about rules. Andy encouraged his companions to ""finish us off"" at which point we decided to give up. It was a petty and disappointing scene. I'm embarrassed to have to even write stuff like this. Definitely not a very welcoming environment. Definitely kind of a bro club. Whatever. We'll take our business elsewhere.

Bocce Ball. Yes, really, Bocce Ball. Bocce Ball courts in this bar. How cool is that?

Well, how about -

Cocktails, leather couches, beer cheese, live bands, cool music, craft beer, bar eats menu, and fireplaces.

Union Hall is a 5000 square foot bar. They feature live music and comedy acts too.

The place itself is huge with a chill vibe. Bands play on the lower level. The decor all around is very cool and looks unlike most any bar. Kind of like a hipster version of an eccentric library.

Of course I had to check this place out when I was in the area recently. Of course I had to try out a cocktail called the ""Bocce Ball"" which was made with Maker's Mark.

Of course, I need to come back here one day but first I need to brush up on how to play Bocce Ball.

Admittedly, I wasn't sure what to expect when I walked in. There is a distinct hipster vibe, between the bookshelves, couches, indoor bocce lanes, and well-curated drink list, but honestly I was impressed. My experience was a bit different because I was part of a large party that had reserved the space in the back, but the food I tasted (bbq sliders, delicious hot wings, and french fries with creamy queso) was good enough for me to seriously consider coming back for more.

I was also really impressed with the drink selection, as I don't love beer, but they had several ciders and a wonderful sour on tap, which made me very happy. The bocce was a lot of fun (I had somehow never played before), and the music was on point.

I would definitely go back for more!

This is actually a review of the comedy club located at Union Hall.  We were extremely disappointed to find out the comedy show was in the basement.  First, you walk pass some huge garbage bins into a dark alley.  Then, you walk down a narrow staircase.  It was extremely crowded with no sprinkler system.  Possibly a fire hazard!  There were too many people and chairs in such a small venue.  People would not be able to leave this place safely in the event of an emergency. Comedy itself was okay.

You're at Union Hall with a salon of Brooklyn artists. They think it's cute that you're from LA, that you wear leopard print and black nail polish. It's much different than their sweater vests or norm core Adidas, their shorts and large hoodies. ""You have bangs, I have bangs,"" you tell them. Get over the differences. Differences make the world go 'round.

You play lawn bowling indoors here and drink seven dollar beers. The best part about this place is that it's crowded, even on a weeknight. The taco truck just outside is decent, too. Seven dollar beers and a ten dollar burrito and you're officially living the Brooklyn artist dream, shoveling crunched bills onto the bar top, the ones from your barista job, twenty-percent-tips for the many five dollar lattes you make. The ones with the hearts and flowers. It's not what you're best at drawing. You're better at body parts. Fluid. Sad eyes, capturing mood. Your painting philosophy is to capture mood, be accurate in sadness, melancholy, and sleep with your subjects...no, that's not the right order. Paint what you love, who you've slept with. Yes.

You like Union Hall. It's not something you'd paint, but you remember your first night here with Leine, you said, ""Not much going on in Park Slope,"" and she went on to name every city in the globe. It was where to go next. Irony was you were happy here with her just the same. It wasn't until she'd talk about work and money that you'd begin to freak out about life. That she didn't share the same values with her being set on masturbating her clients. She gave you a new perspective on sex work. She said, what's the difference between what she did and what your cohort does, prostituting your souls perhaps is worse...what you'd all do to sell paintings...it's true. But it's nothing you're proud of, you said, and there was the impasse.

Union Hall's beer list is good. The Brooklyn breweries and that the bars are open late here, is good. As well as the room downstairs, you've attended a few readings...one time music. Tonight everyone seems to be tired-happy, arguing about form matching content and how good artists go against the grain...that when things are done intentionally is all that matters. For instance, wearing a t-shirt to a gala. Only sometimes a faux pas. But what about a tuxedo, here?

You picture Leine in a formal dress and she'd sit on a Union Hall couch, the tufted one, and how tragic it looked and how tragic it all is. She shaved her head. You're losing your hair. You're here at Union Hall with a different set of people entirely. No one to hold onto at night when your stomach is full of burrito, and your once full heart is aching and sore. From all that holding on to a dream.

So many things to say. Very cool interior upstairs, a rad karaoke night downstairs on Fridays, and lots of spots to sit. An overall chill bar ONCE THEY GET RID OF THEIR ASSHOLE DOORMAN.

As other reviews have stated, ""the heavier, lighter skinned African American doorman"" is an outright ass hole. I know doormen don't have the easiest of jobs, but there was no excuse for this guy acting the way he did.

After leaving the bar to smoke, I had forgotten my ID inside, and after telling him the situation upon reentering- he just shrugged without looking at me so I took that as his indifference and go to get my ID, walk three steps into the bar and he shouts at me ""GET THE FUCK OUT OF THE BAR! GET. THE. FUCK. OUT."" at least five times and aggressively bounces on his feet in front of me looking like he's ready to make this physical. Like a 5'5"" girl is going to start a fight with him???

A terrible experience. The bouncer earlier in the night was very professional, so I don't know how this other guy still even works there. Disappointing, especially since there are several reviews about him.

Ive never written a yelp review but I had to just to express how unprofessional and irrational this guy was. For the sake of those who still plan on visiting this bar (not me), I hope Aggressive Doorman either has a change of character or isn't there all together.

One of the places my husband and I loved visiting but unfortunately tonight the bartender at the basement was so rude I'm afraid I might not go back.
I ordered a drink,gave her my card, she asked if I'd like to keep a tab or close it, I said- please close it. She came back, asked my friend, who also ordered his drink, she asks the same question, he says close it, and she brings him his check and the drink. I tell her that I also had asked to close my tab and she very loudly starts to say - ""oh, well, when I ask do you want to keep a tab you nod (makes dramatic nodding gesture- I'm Indian so I'm not sure if that's why she thought it was okay to say that) and by the way, we don't normally do one drink on the card. You have to keep a tab open."" I tell her OK, I didn't know. Then she says, ""yeah well, you're going to have to come back for your card now because I'm busy.""
She did NOT tell me she can't do one drink order on the card, I would have paid cash happily. She didn't have to yell these things at me, and she sure could have closed my tab since she clearly didn't mind doing the same with other customers, including my friend. I'm so sad, because the bartenders upstairs were super nice and welcoming and I have loved coming here in the past for their stand up shows and valued the inclusive feeling.

Union Hall's ambience is LUXURIOUS. Lots of cozy cuddling spots to impress your date!

You don't even have to talk much to your date, because there is LOTS going on here besides eating and drinking.

Need an ice breaker? Jump into bocce ball!

Or see a famous comedian and chat about the performance!

The LIVE COMEDY -- often sold out (buy your tickets in advance) -- is FUN!!

The bar is STELLAR. Miles and Oscar make GREAT martinis with FAT olives :)

Bathroom is European, so do your makeup in advance.

Come to Union Hall to enjoy Italian bowling, books, music, drinks, and comedy.

P.S.
Don't forget your IDs!

While Union Hall's space upstairs is AWESOME with lots of sofas for romantic dates, and the bartenders and drinks ROCK, this is what I DON'T like about Union Hall:

-Union Hall's food menu, which I have been trying since Union Hall first opened, seems to be getting worse. Years ago, at Union Hall, I endured nachos covered in cold Velveeta (processed slimy goo that has an American cheese flavor). Lately, when I go, I struggle finding any healthy vegetarian or fish options. If you want a burger and fries, you should be fine here. Yet, for hungry health nuts, skip this place, unless you seek a healthy martini ;)

-When it comes to live entertainment at Union Hall, you're stuck in a crowded, small basement with a *stage* that's maybe a foot off the ground. Littlefield, which is near by at 635 Sackett Street, has a WAY better performance space, usually charges half as much as Union Hall does, and gets just as much talent.

What I LOVE about Union Hall is:

-The professional, engaging bartenders and bouncers (yes -- the bouncers here are nice).

-The inviting, comfortable sofas and chairs.

-The bocce court, which is always a source of entertainment, whether you are playing or not. However, you might wait forever to actually play bocce yourself.

-The EXCELLENT adult beverages.

-At least 50% of the patrons, who are friendly, on any given night.

-The unisex bathrooms that force you to do hair and make up in a shared, unisex sink room. While this could be a turn off for some, I get a kick out of it, because this bathroom set up is rare for this part of town.

So if you can stand the food menu or aren't hungry, love waiting in line for hours to play bocce, want a decent drink served by experienced bartenders who know what they are doing, want a couch for public date snuggling, enjoy unisex bathrooms, love being surrounded by walls filled with books, and don't mind seeing live performances in a crowded basement with a low ceiling, this might be your ULTIMATE NIGHT LIFE experience!!!

Came here with a friend after hearing it described as ""a bar that feels like a library."" Yes--I'm in!

There's a lot to say about Union Hall. You walk in, the bar is to your right (it's smaller than you think) and you've got some floor to ceiling book shelves on the left. The shelves are filled with books and are flanked by comfortable seating. It's reminiscent of a social club lounge. Keep walking further and you'll notice a few tables and two huge bocci ball courts/lanes. Bathrooms are downstairs; they're not separated by gender and sport some floor to ceiling doors with the airport like ""occupied"" latch. Also downstairs is an event space for bands. We didn't get to see it as we went pretty early.

Now you've got the layout of the place. Food. Food was pretty good for bar food. Did I just use the word food three times in two sentences? Did I just use it a fourth? I had a burger and fries. The burger was a little disappointing. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good and for the price, I expected better. The fries were delicious though. I highly recommend the Japanese style spicy mayo for extra yummy'ness.

Can't say the bartenders were really on point here. Maybe it was just early and they were slightly understaffed, but it wasn't especially bad. I will say that the bartender was a little rude to an incoming patron who had a stroller. He told them they didn't allow strollers, but did it in a kind of crappy way. He kept saying ""look at the sign,"" ""the sign explains it,"" ""we don't allow strollers."" He could have just said the don't allow strollers in the bar, but instead he just kept telling them to look at the sign. That's not a super friendly way to communicate, but it's also not efficient since there's a couple of signs on the door.

Anyway, this is a cool bar to visit and if you're into music, I think it's even better. I'll probably stop in again for a beer if I'm in the area.

One of the bars that makes Brooklyn great. Indoor bocce pits and an Edgar Allen Poe-ish lounge area surrounding a fireplace upstairs and full dance hall downstairs with lots of cool themed events, are its defining features that attract three distinct crowds. But it works so beautifully, and many patrons (myself included) choose to partake in all 3 sections, sometimes in the same night!

$8 for a bud light on a Tuesday 6pm???? Told bartender it says $5 in the menu, which he apologized then as I read the menu a little more I see all beer is $1 off all beer wine and well drinks 4-7 pm. Bud light should of been $4 bucks. Bad day for remembering numbers I guess. I don't know this bar but not off to a good start. Got to watch your money here. Bartender made amends, bought me a beer for honest mistake, alls good cool place, definitely a gay bar, not that is bad just saying overly non deverse

If it wasn't for the rudeness of the bartender I'd give this place 4-5 stars. Arrogant and impatient bartender was one of the worst I've ever seen. If you hate your job so much, why go in every day. He knows I'm patiently waiting for my turn to order and rudely turns to the individual behind me and asks them what they want (individual tells him that I was next). I asked him what a drink includes, he impatiently looks at me as if I'm an idiot and tells me it has some tequila and some juice and then says am I gonna order or not. As I'm placing an order for 6 drinks (same drinks that I asked about) and several appetizers of food, he asks me when the hell am I gonna be done ordering.... Put absolutely zero care into making my drinks which were horrible and we couldn't finish (none of the 6). As important it is to have a nice place with a nice vibe, it's even more important to have people that care about treating your clients with care.

It takes a lot for me to leave a one star review but after having the worst, most negative experience ordering a drink from a bar in New York, possibly in my life, well - you earned it. The bartender exuded so much negative energy from the moment we approached the bar it was nearly tangible. His body language and tone were both aggressive and it made me extremely uncomfortable. If the drinks were good than maybe it would have been mildly forgivable but our drinks were absolutely horrendous.

The vibe in this place is cool but this single interaction with the bartender murdered it. I will never be returning and steering all my friends away from this place at all costs. Get pleasant bartenders, his attitude (Keith is the name on the check) is abhorrent.

Well it saddens me to write this review because I've been coming here well over 8yrs off & on. The mere fact that in this day & age racism still exits is beyond me. I came here during the week after work to get a quick drink & my favorite fries. I sat at the bar as usual & was greeted by a tall heavyset gentlemen who was very nice for what it seemed. I ordered Allagash White & a shot of tequila. Has two rounds of that with fries. Two white gentlemen came in & sat to the left of me and then later on another white male came in & sat to the right of me. I was finishing  up my second round when the bartender offered the gentleman to my right  around on him then he proceeded to offer the single guy to my right a round on him meanwhile I tipped him $10 throughout this disrespect. I would never step foot back into Union Hall after this. Time to move on. FYI...this star is under protest cause it wouldn't let me post my review without rating

Pretty sweet spot might I say. There's even a bocce ball area. I was here for a private video release party downstairs, pretty dope. I was hungry so I ordered the veggie burger and a couple beers. The veggie burger was my top choice since all the yelpers and even the bartender raved about it.

Conclusion? It was beyond delicious. Definitely will stop by in the future on my own now that I know this place exists.

My colleagues and I came here yesterday for our office holiday party. It was a lunch buffet style setup where we had appetizers, entrees, and cake. The party was held on the 3rd floor and the room was brightly lit and spacious. The food was good and I really like fried calamari appetizer, chicken marsala, and the cake.

The only thing that I didn't like was that we had to wait an hour before the entrees were ready to be served. Our party time was from 1 - 4pm and the hot entrees wasn't ready until 2pm. At least the appetizers were already setup for us when we arrived. Overall, the service was still good here.

Love this place! Was in town visiting from the Detroit area and was so happy we found this gem that reminds me of a bar back home. On the high end of a dive bar with good bar good, nice alcohol options, friendly service and just a cozy welcoming pub.
Went there twice within four days if that tells you anything!

I went to White Horse Tavern for lunch and got the Bridge Street Burger Deluxe with Sweet Potato Fries. The burger had bacon, Swiss, mushrooms, lettuce, and tomatoes on it. Although it had standard ingredients, it was a very tasty burger. A couple minor points for improvement would be that they cooked the patty a bit more than I would have liked, the bacon was a little too crunchy, and there could have been more cheese. Also, the ketchup in the bottle was super liquidy, which was slightly concerning.

When we arrived at the restaurant, we were confused because there was no one to greet us or guide us to a table. After waiting for a minute, we were told to just sit down at a table and wait for a waiter to come (he came after a few minutes). He was not the friendliest, but that was understandable given that he was the only waiter working at the restaurant. The service speed was pretty good. The interior of the restaurant has a classic dark tavern kind of ambiance.

Overall, the White Horse Tavern is a solid place to come for an affordable burger (mine was $11 + $1 for the sweet potato fries). I would recommend it to anyone interested in a tavern kind of vibe in the Financial District.

Love the old school neighborhood bar. They have A limited list of drafts, but they had something for everyone.
This place is simple
And good - a place that hasn't succumbed to the yuppie high end ""gastro pub"" or clean foodie movements. There is a warmth and family feel - it felt like a bar with family.

I ordered the burger and was very happy! It was a classic old school burger with special sauce and some shredded lettuce. This type of thing holds a special place in my heart. I also opted for the onion rings. I usually  succumb to the temptation of fries, because not that many places make good onion rings. Often I find onion rings that are some frozen food fast fryer product called onion ring.
Not these! They were hot, juicy, and have plump big slices of sweet onion. Delicious!

This is a great tavern to visit in the financial district. They have plenty of friendly faces and a great bartender. It seems like it is a regulars hang out. They have some great bar snack food including some awesome wings. They were so friendly in there that we ended up buying drinks back-and-forth with the regulars. That made us feel like we were really part of the place. Very welcoming.

The drinks were priced well, beer was cold and the food was delicious! What else can you want?

The atmosphere feels like an old Irish pub, the mixture of the work crowd, a few tourists, etc on a Monday evening was great while in route to the ferry. The pastrami Ruben was delicious, the whiskey chicken sandwich was great according to my dinner mates, so good I never even got a bite.

I stopped in with 2 coworkers for a quick drink after work. It was a little before 5pm, so it wasn't super full. We sat at the bar and ordered some well drinks. I think it was HH, so there was a discount. Drinks were good and strong.

We also ordered mozzarella sticks and onion rings. Both really hit the spot.

Bartender was nice and attentive. I'd recommend White Horse Tavern if you work in the area and are looking for a good spot for HH after work.

This place was so cute and quaint! I don't eat meat and asked about the veggie burger- they went so far as to bring me the label from the packaging so I could read the ingredients. They were just so helpful ! Also after spending exorbitant amounts of money on food in NY it was so nice to find a place that was good and didn't break the bank. Employees were all very friendly !

Great service. Family Friendly!  The burgers were good. I would pass on the brisket. Being a TEXAN I am very particular about my BBQ. The beer was cold and fries were hot and crispy.
Sorry was charging my phone when the food came.  Another great service feature.
Thanks again!

I left a review about 10 months ago, I was unhappy with my order. Frank (the owner) reached out to me and expressed his concerns and was extremely apologetic about the whole situation. He explained things to me and told me that he'd like for me to come back and offered a complimentary meal / drink for returning. The last time I went to White horse, was my last week before I resigned from working at the Statue of Liberty after 8 long years, so I had not been there since. I recently came w. an old co-worker sometime in February and I can say that the hospitality, food & drinks were fantastic. I met Frank, he is such a pleasant person and attentive to patrons needs. What I appreciated most wasn't the complimentary food but his concern to my bad experience, which most business owners tend to ignore. Frank, thank you so much for making my return worth coming back when I'm around the area.

I like coming here, simply because it's close from work and many of my co workers come to hang out for drinks. Today was different... I came w. Friends to share goodbyes and see you later so we ate there. I LOVE WINGS and my was I dissatisfied. The worse wings I've ever had in my life. They were so distasteful, bitter and raw ... I showed my boyfriend the pictures and he told me I should of sent those wings back. I had thought well maybe the first few that I ate were okay being that I was so hungry I tolerated it and once I got to that one it was just awful seeing uncooked wings.

One of the oldest bars in Manhattan, and also very reasonably priced. I was here with a long-time friend and we both really enjoyed our meals. He plays in a dart league and has played here before. It is just the perfect part divey and the perfect part historic. We had dinner here and a couple drinks. The drinks are so much less expensive than the venues over on Stone Street. Well worth a two block walk to come over here instead. It was crowded on a Friday night, but not obnoxiously so. Bartenders were slightly indifferent, but they did what they were supposed to do, and our food came out quickly. I'll be coming back here again.

After work hours for Happy Hour was desired for day's end wash out.  After reading all the reviews of their Happy Hour it was a opportunity not to be missed.  I decided on Cupcake Prosecco $8 (Italy).  Customer service is not attentive albeit it was moderately packed for a Thursday evening.  Atmosphere contains boisterously loud background music as it can be heard outside by the entrance door.  White Horse is a dive bar in the Financial District of Downtown Manhattan where many white collar workers flock here to alleviate workplace stress and pressure.

I loved this place ! Took a minute for someone to take our order. But food was good, reasonable in price . Cute little tavern!

Fish n chips was large portion for 12$.
Hubby had soup w corned beef sandwich finished it all and he normally doesn't eat sandwiches. His fav part was cheap beer! Important when your on vacation.

We would have went back but they were not open the next day.(Sat)

This has to be the worst service I've ever received. The manager was rude, condescending, and slow to even bring out water.

Fast forward to the food part of this and it was nothing less than underwhelming. The only good part of the food was the cheap price but I was more than willing to pay for better food.

Save time, money, and the pain of dealing with the staff and Eat somewhere else. New York has a ton of food places to offer.

No sign of gentrification here. They still have their fall decorations up well into November, which I appreciate
I needed a pick me up after a particularly rough afternoon at work-it's not 5pm yet, but I was in good company with a few bar flys. This is a place for jack on the rocks and beer, and I love that.

I should have known this place was going to be bad when I walked up and 4 men were literally carrying a guy out because he was incoherent. I decided to take a chance because I was hungry and wanted to wet my whistle with a good beer.

Upon arriving we were not greeted by anyone and made our own way to a table. We sat for about 7 minutes before the waitress/bar tender came over. She was soft spoken and hard to understand because it was so loud in the bar. I ordered a Brooklyn Pilsner to try the beers of NYC and at first I thought she got it wrong because she was mumbling. She did get the right order but it took another 7 minutes just to bring it over.

As for food, we ordered the sampler platter and the white horse burger. I have to admit the fried Mac and cheese is AMAZING!!!! These are a must have if you decide to step into this place after reading my review. Burger was average, chicken fingers were sauce-less, and everything else was average. The wings were the worst thing I ever ate, and I'm not just saying that because I'm from Buffalo. They didn't even look like wings and they were soooo undercooked! My husband was actually afraid he was going to get sick! We weren't able to tell our waitress because she NEVER came to check on us!!!! Terrible terrible service! Once the waitress came over, when we were ready to leave, we showed her the raw, bloody wings and she seemed disinterested and unconcerned about it. She did not offer to replace or comp any portion of our check. When we went to pay, we took our own check up to the bar because we couldn't stand to wait anymore. I would never come back.

I ordered at the counter for to go - and it took about 15 mins.  I just wanted brisket and I believe they charged me for the deli sandwich which was around $6 plus tax.  I got some fatty pieces and some leaner pieces, so it was a perfect variety.  Super tender and delicious.  It was pretty packed but I went on a Friday around 1pm.

I would recommend this place for their lunch specials, or a quick drink at their bar.  The bar looked fully loaded!

Pretty cool spot in FiDi. Some people call it a dive bar, but I'd say their menu and layout is more like a laid back restaurant. Stopped in here for lunch right as they opened last week and was happy with the choice. Was looking for a nice quiet place to have a meeting and this was the perfect spot.

We both ordered sandwiches, and were pretty satisfied. I will say the roast beef I had was a little dry, but the flavor was there.

Main takeaways from this place were that it is far from what you'd expect in lower Manhattan if you're an outsider. Prices were cheap and the atmosphere feels much different than being in a big city. We didn't drink, but it seems like a good spot to come for cheap drinks during happy hour.  Looking forward to coming back next time I'm in the area.

Terrible experience.
The burger tasted like the frozen kind, all watery plus it was over cooked.
The waitress seemed like she was avoiding our table and it was impossible to call her attention.
I don't recommend this place at all.

Came to check it out and it was very chill at when beginning, bartender was not attentive to what I order so she got my drink wrong twice and after she realized she said it was ""on her"". Whatever, counted how many beers I had. Then just sitting there I felt water dripping down my back. The guy next to me (a stranger) push me out of the way before water starts to pour down from the ceiling, my jacket got wet but whatever it dryers fast. My back was wet and I think some people next to me (whom I think are the owners) said ""oh I know what it is"".  I didn't care, it just took me by surprise. I just hope it wasn't toilet water cuz I still had a couple of places to go. Well they said this was a place to visit. Eh it was okay. Besides getting a shower bartenders should be nicer and maybe check on pluming ever now and then. (Btw she did charge me the ""on me"" beers)

I like honesty. I had the chicken tenders with a salad mix thing on the side- it was nice to have an option as opposed to having fries thrown at my face. Bill total, with apple cider? $14.00 A manhattan deal, if there is one. Also, they have real honey mustard. None of that Kens dressing packet business here.

I've come here a few times.  It's about what you would expect from an Irish pub with a few nice surprises.

For the food menu, they have your typical burgers, shepherd's pie, and fish & chips.  They have some interesting varieties of burgers that have some unexpected flavors for an Irish pub.

In addition to the typical American mainstream beers, they also have a number of craft beers from the region.

The service is decent.  They're not super attentive, but they are friendly.  My last time there, the bartender was all alone and the tables were pretty much full of large parties and the bar was pretty full, too.  He was doing his best, but he certainly needed a server to help out.

This is a tavern in FiDi that is frequented by both locals and people who work in the area. The bartender that we were chatting with was awesome. She has this no-frills kind of attitude and sarcastic humor that is really cool. She's Irish so she has an amazing accent.

We came in for what is known as the special - which is 1 can of PBR and 1 shot of your choosing for $5. The shots are pretty big. Worth the money.

The interior has a warm and cozy feeling. Will be returning.

We were looking for a place to have lunch after visiting the Statue of Liberty while in town. Decided this looked like a great local experience and kept with our ""no chain food"" during our trip.

Loved the look and feel as soon as we walked in, truly feels like an old tavern.

My roast beef sandwich was great, perfectly cooked. Wife had a BLT that she really enjoyed and my son had a burger which was also executed well. No complaints about the food at all.

Where i had to take off points:

Not the friendliest staff in the world. When we walked in and asked if we should seat ourselves, the bartender just waved his arms and said ""open seating...""

Same with taking our order, just didn't really seem interested. We were quite obviously tourists ( was carrying a camera bag, my son wearing a hat that gave it away...) and he made no effort to engage us at all. Maybe if we were regulars it would've been different, but I didn't really see the staff engaging as we sat there eating our lunch.

Second...we ordered sodas and i'm pretty sure my mouth fell open when he sat cans down on the table with cups of ice.

Neither of those are huge, they're not deal breakers for me, but...enough to knock a couple of stars off.

If you're in the financial district/battery park area and looking for a good tavern/bar where you can get a good bite, be left alone, this is your place. I would certainly go back for another try if I was in the area.

Came with kids after NYC tourist trip to Statue of Liberty.  Excellent, quick and friendly service.  Food was great, beer selection was solid and place was calm and not too crazy for a Friday before noon.  History is permeating from the walls, but not too dreary.  Waitress was kind and owner came by to check on us.

I am a big fan of old, divey bars and I love that this kind of bar still exists. The prices are the most affordable in the area, the food is pretty dang good for dive bar pub fare (get the rueben) and I am glad places like this still exist in the city.

Is it fancy? No. Is it innovative? No. Is it cheap and unpretentious? Yes, and I love it!

I came here with my coworkers to say farewell to a leaving coworker! Definitely not a place to come for a quiet talk over drinks. It was super, super packed and loud! They have great deals on drinks, and their food is pretty standard. Classic bar food -- we got the sampler platter and fries! The fries were not as crisp as I would have liked -- but they came out hot!

We were unsure at first but this place was great for lunch! We went with a large party and kids and it was a good experience.

The burgers and fish and chips were stellar. Really great bar food at reasonable prices.

The service was dry but very attentive and nice. We enjoyed our visit! The building seemed historic and had been there for over a century!

Great stop after Battery park. We highly recommend.

Bar tenders are nice & they have really cheap drinks. To be honest id pass on the food, there aint nothing spectacular here about the food. but in this area, youll get cheap prices on drinks. i was a little surprised by the house tequila, it was good. not sure what it was, but ill take another shot. also the choices on draft were a little more variety than i would have thought. plenty of tables to sit at, second floor, and bathrooms are spotless.

We hopped off the Staten Island Ferry and walked a block and stumbled upon this tavern.
It was pretty packed but we had great service and got our food quickly.
The food was delicious! I had a grilled cheese and soup and my husband had fish & chips. Excellent!
Definitely will return.

Friends from Marocco in town..,and I tooked them here!

      Great classic old-school bar.  Typical bar food..., with somewhat of a open patio / large doors..,for summer climates..,and Autum.

     Good Beer  selections, with Ale..,Pilsner's..,and Largers.  Brooklyn Brew company is not far away..., so they definatly had their Brew selections.

      Medium level 70's and 80's rock music..,mixed with some 90's ( ""OffSpring"") alternative rock.

      I'd definatly go back!!

Very reasonable prices bar in the Williamsburg area. They have beer and shot specials for $11 which usually is a price of a beer in the yuppie type bars in the area. It's super close to Music hall of Williamsburg which I was going to that evening.

The vibe was real chill and plenty of space to hang out with a large crowd of friends.

This place is a great place to chill and spend the day with friends drinking, chitchatting and there is a pool table that charges you $2 a game and in the back there are darts! However they don't serve food here which is probably the only downside....but they let you bring food in! The AC is also inside during the summer so don't worry about being too hot in one place!

Reasonably priced drinks with friendly bar tenders? Count me in! Only thing is I wish they had more outdoor seating or brighter lighting indoors. Otherwise, completely recommend if you're on a bit of a budget and want some drinks!!!!!!!!

I hate drinking in NYC because it's so expensive so I never thought I'd find some place so reasonably priced like Zabloski's, especially in the middle of Williamsburg!

The vibe is really chill. I came on Halloween night and it was pretty empty. Granted, it was a Tuesday. The bartenders were really nice and attentive and also made tasty drinks so I left very happy.

For an idea of how much drinks are, my friend and I paid $7 for whiskey sours and vodka pineapples and their specialty cocktails were $11. Such a good price for NYC! Would recommend coming here. Especially if you're going to a show at Music Hall of Williamsburg like we were. Only a block away!

One of the bartenders (with the beard, didn't catch his name) is horrendous. Not only is he dry and sarcastically rude, he's also homophobic. He refused to serve me after he asked me to stop touching my girlfriend ""because there were other people around"". Completely unwarranted and terrible for business. Avoid.

Friendliest bartenders I've met in NYC. Cocktails were very creative and definitely A+. Good local and craft beer selection Prices are reasonable for Williamsburg and NYC. I highly recommend if you're looking for a good local bar in Brooklyn.

Stumbled across Zablozki's during a night out in Brooklyn with my significant other and had the best time! Our bartender, Seamus, was amazing. The type of bartender you definitely want for a fun night out. Super quick service, wonderful conversation and an all around a good time! We will definitely be back. :)

This place is lit. The bartenders are the bomb - Shirley (yasssss boo!) and Shamus are hilarious, down to earth, and refreshing! Hard to find that in many NYC bars. The vibes are right, fun to get turnt or to just chill, and having pool, pinball, and darts helps too.

Right across from the very much played out Sea, I'm surprised a place this legit exists in such a touristy, gentrified part of Columbus' Brooklyn!

I'll definitely be coming back!

I was here on Sunday. The bartender was so suck! He was trying to bring back the empty beer glasses and he suddenly dropped my full beer glass on the floor. He never came back to clean it !!!!!

We stopped in for a drink before a movie. They had cool Halloween decor which added to the ambiance. Good playlist too. The bartender was very friendly and nice. Our birthdays are almost the same so that's a plus. Gotta love Virgo's! He makes a great aperol spritz. Go here!!!!

I think they're going to rename this place, ""Don't Call Me Shirley"", after one of the bartenders named Shirley. She is an interesting character!

Cool bar to visit in Williamsburg esp. on Sundays when the have (had?)  3$ mimosas.  Too crowded for me usually Fri or Sat nights, but nearly every place is.  Cool pool area in the back.

The other bartenders are ok but some of the male ones need to dress and groom more appropriately.

Also, the name ""Zabloski's"" has to go...

Stylish bar in one of my favorite neighborhoods.   $3 mimosas on Sunday were awesome.

If they had TVs behind the bar to watch events , that would be nice but there is one in the back of the bar.  Hippest neighborhood in NYC.

My boyfriend and I kind of stumbled upon this bar. It was after a 90+ degree day at Smorgasburg and we were really just looking for a break from the heat. A quick search for cheap drinks led us to Zablozki's and I'm glad we found it. It wasn't packed on a Saturday afternoon at around 4.

Zablozki's is a really chill dive bar, that reminds me of a saloon. Plus, they have happy hour til 8 on weekends - $3 mimosas and $4 bloodys (which I can't say I liked - it was really thick and had this weird brown color).

Stick to the beer and you'll be okay.

I've been coming here for almost a decade! Casual low key atmosphere, cheep drinks. Whoever does the radio is awesome, it's like they're playing my ipod on shuffle. I used to bring dates here all the time, because it's a great place to grab drink and have a conversation. It usually doesn't get to loud or crowded.

Bartender not very pleasant. We ordered an Oktoberfest beer, it was light and gross. Not his fault. We asked to swap our beers. He said ""Uhh sure, okay, I'll let Germany know."" Thanks for the sarcasm? Whatever. We got a different beer, we both liked that one much better, not that he asked. We also happen to be sitting in front of the taps, so we got a dirty look every time he filled a beer order from someone else. Totally unnecessary if you ask me... anyway, my date says they get an extra point for having the New York Rangers game on, even though if you're sitting at the bar you can only see half the screen because the television is placed right behind one of the light fixtures... I probably will not come back here. Too many other bars that actually care about return service.

A quick stroll down from Smorgasborg on Saturdays! It was really hot out and my friend and I did not feel like taking cash out to drink at Smorgasborg so we did a quick search on Yelp and found this bar. They were just opening then and had the whole front open. We sat at the bar to drink. There were specials going on for mimosas during the day time so I ordered those. The drink was not too strong which is absolutely fine by me. They had a nice bar with a wide array of selections and if I felt a little more sure about my ability to navigate back home, I would have tried some. There were craft beers on tap, but not an overwhelming amount of selection that has you lost. The bartender was super nice, a bubbly young lady who was good about attending to us when we needed to order more and leaving us alone when we didn't need the extra attention.

Walked into this place all giddy expecting to catch me a few ""$3 YuengLings"" as the reviews on yelp mentioned. There were no yuenglings and the cheapest beer was a $4 bud light.

Although I was let down about the lack of deals that other reviews raved about. This place was ok. Not great not bad.

I've seen most of the nightlife on N 6th close over the last year or so, but Zabloski's still stands and hasn't changed.

It's got a dive vibe without being dirty*. Sure, they've got a cocktail list and sparkling wine, but they've also got pool and darts and pinball and cheap beer and chill bartenders.

* Except the bathrooms.

I love Zablozki's for being a bar. No gimmicks, no pretentiousness, no problems. You come here to drink. Just a bar. But a damn good one.

The drink specials are probably the best anywhere near Bedford, the bartenders are friendly (for the most part), it's great for groups or to make a few new friends, and they've got darts and pool. Yes, $2 pool is kind of a slap in the face, but when you've got a beer and a shot for $5, I tend not to care about much after about an hour.

They also allow food delivery. And seemingly, obscene public drunkenness.

The perfect ""neighborhood tavern"" standing strong in a neighborhood that continues to undergo a vicious, violent metamorphosis.

This is my favorite bar to meet friends in the neighborhood. Great vibe, chill, reasonably priced, comfortable, fun, and friendly. Just...

Make sure you know where you are, and get a beer. I wouldn't waste my money on say, their (slightly overpriced) watery old-fashioneds and other ""classic cocktails""-- although they make the best Hot Toddy within a 100 mile radius.

Pinball, pool tables, clean bathrooms, and awesome music remain consistent ""amenities"".

With doors that open, Parisian style, onto N. 6th street (although, now you're facing cloying Nolita virus mutations like Le Labo) it remains a valuable part of the neighborhood.

DJ Questlove at the Brooklyn Bowl spinnin' the ones and twos...

It's so rare that I find myself in Brooklyn on a Thursday night. Nevertheless, at the insistence of my woman, I came to the Brooklyn Bowl for a soul-trainesque affair. Unfortunately, our compatriots decided to dine at Balthazar first and so having arrived late, we were unceremoniously forced to leave the crowded resturant in  search of a place to rest our legs nearby.

As my life choices are pretty much dictated by a combination of Yelp reviews and an incapacitating fear of failure, I decided to make my way to this well-reviewed bar to kill some time before the show.

The bar was somewhat empty when we walked in. There were a few people in the back and about 4-5 people sitting at the bar. The bartenders were two women who seemed to be relatively busy. I took a look at their cocktail menu and went with one that seemed to be their version of an old-fashion. The cocktails are cheap by Manhattan standards, about $7-8 per drink. PBRs were even cheaper, around $3-4.

There's a sign that says cash only but they do take credit card. LOL. You hipsters are so ironic.

For a place that serves decent drinks at respectable prices, there's no reason not to give 4 stars.

Carry on, Zablozki.

I really adore this place. It's definitely not to be overlooked, I have been here twice, both with groups.  The most recent time was last night on NYE after dinner and before heading to a big bash at another locale. The bartenders are always helpful and quick to get out drinks. I paid $6 for a whiskey sour which is in line with old Williamsburg prices and it was in a good sized glass. I was impressed that they had awesome NYE favors EVERYWHERE! Good job Zablozki's. It almost made me wish I was ringing in the New Year at your place because it was so inviting. There is also a pool table and dart board.

I don't often write reviews of places, even if I like them but when I feel compelled to write a review I just have to. Zablowski has been a neighborhood bar for awhile here in this neighborhood and I've never had a problem. Staff is super friendly, and atmosphere is rustic. I like that even if it's crowded it still feels quaint. I like to come here and and have a drink and think of projects that need to be worked on. Music is always on point and pool playing friends enjoy there pool table. Locals pretty much drink here and everyone is really friendly.

My friends and I needed a break from all the face-stuffing experience of the very conspicuously dry Smorgasburg, so we walked to this nearby bar to wet our whistles. The SO was familiar with the joint from her days in W-burg and approved.

It was remarkably empty on a Saturday afternoon, which made for a very casual chilling-on-the-patio couple of hours. There were a number of warm weather brews on tap, including a kolsch. Refreshing!

The bartender was friendly and there was no pretensions, stress, or drama. Vintage latter-day Brooklyn. (An experience that was nearly replicated at the Brooklyneer a few days ago.)

I don't know why so many bad reviews. This place is great. Been twice during my week in NYC and the bartenders Brandon and Seamus were on top of their game. Nice to be in a cozy, dimly lit bar that isn't a half assed attempt at being an Irish Pub and doesn't have some kitschy theme like so many spots out here. I'd happily come back next time I'm in NY.

Dying breed here in gentrified bk. As the chilax hip hop joints dwindle and honky tonky shacks pop up in abundance this place makes you feel as if all that negativity is halted. (Given you don't look out the window or around you). A definite place to relax and unwind on Mondays.

We looked for a place to play darts around this area. And this place was great. Spacey and clean. The darts was in the back, I like this set up. People from far wouldn't see how well you are throwing, Only those who sit at the last table would see. Which is a very great idea!! which they did had more dart boards tho. They did had a small pool table and a pinball machine.

We came here on a Sunday evening and there was happy hour from like 12pm-8pm. SCORE! drinks were cheap and reasonable. I think like $3 for mimosa $4 for drafts. really good deal. Bartender was nice. My group and I stayed for about 4 hours and we had a great time here. Will be back!!

Very cool spot with plenty of personality and drafts. Cocktails are good, too. The outside patio is dope, including the stabbed Pinocchio a few feet underground (no further explanation available). I was just here for a birthday celebration and had a great time. Shuffleboard available for those who get bored easily. It's an odyssey away from my apartment, but when I find myself in Greenpoint again I may totally go back.

The Diamond (in the rough) is another great douchy bar in Greenpoint with a decent sized patio--5 benches--and a shuffleboard. I stopped by for some saison on tap. They feature two good saison this time; ICONYC Hollape√±o and Catskill's Oak-Aged Saison. The latter one is pretty dank which I recommend.

Oh, a cheese plate came in a small portion when I ordered it large. Anyway, the bartender is friendly.

Solid bar in greenpoint. Has outside seating too if the weather is nice. Small tap list but all very good beers. They have some cocktails/wine on the menu and a few bits of nosh if you get hungry. My friend got the spanakopita and liked it.

One shuffleboard court and a decent amount of seating inside but its a small place. Prices were NYC, no deal here. Good vibes and would definitely return.

This is officially my favorite bar in the city.  Not a new bar to this area in greenpoint, by any stretch, but a new bar find for me, and I am glad I found it.

They have some awesome beer and wine here.  Each of the options, tasty and delicious.

The outdoor space is where its at.  I think this is a new thing, and Im not sure if its every night, but they have two lovely ladies slinging grill-made tacos in the back.  They are amazing.  Each of them.  That night, the pork (carnitas) were the clear winner but they were all very good.

This guy. Does he care about business? Clearly it's not his. He said he didn't want to accept my global entry bc he didn't think it was real (I'm 30- the ID is real, it's a Sunday afternoon). Then we were googling global entry to show him that it was legitimate. And he said he didn't FEEL LIKE IT. This was after we asked about the drinks on draft and he told us to go over and read the menu. We couldn't see the menu but we could see there were 6 beers and asked if he wouldn't mind just telling us which was an IPA. Then he said nevermind to our IDs and changed his mind from the legitimacy of IDs to serving. Sucks.

Comment from David P. of The Diamond

Business Owner

3/18/2019Hi Victoria, my name is Dave and I am the owner of the bar.  We were happy when your group came in and were looking forward to getting you guys on the slot car table.  You may remember me on the table getting that started with one of your friends.

In regards to poor service, I never like to hear this and am sorry that you had a bad experience here.  We often tell customers to look at the board when they ask about the beers because its generally an easier starting off point for the customer and the bartender.  We are generally, of course, happy to answer any questions about the products.  But, taking pictures of someone and threatening to report them on yelp because they are not comfortable accepting your ID is not likely to get you the best service.  This should not be overlooked to anyone reading this review.

In regards to the ID, when our bartenders see someone that they think could potentially be under age, they must see a US passport, drivers license, or military ID.  That instruction is a non-negotiable directive that comes from me.  They have no say in the matter.  Global entry ID's are not something we have been shown before and therefore we would have to take time on our own to research it and add it to our list of acceptable ID's or not.  Its not something that we are going to change policy on in 5 seconds because a customer shows us something on google when our entire license and business is at stake.  It doesn't matter what time of day it is or what day of the week.

This is a cute place that's a little off the beaten path.  They have a nice enough beer selection.  There is definitely a ""locals"" type of vibe going on here, so I felt like a bit of an interloper as I tried to enjoy my draft.

The shuffleboard is kind of neat to watch and the decor is nice.  Service was a bit slow for a place that only had about 10 people total in it, but again, I think that's because I'm not a regular.

If you're in the neighborhood, you wouldn't be disappointed if you stopped by.

Recommended by those In the know, this did not disappoint.  Super-cool ambience, fairly amazing cocktail concoctions, friendly service.  Nerd note:  the music they were playing was incredible.   Almost all female-fronted new wave/post-punk like Girls at Our Best, Raincoats, etc.  If I lived here, I'd live here.

Nice bar, with interesting beer selection and interesting food menu. Nice outdoor patio also in the back. Bartender had no interest in serving our group and was rude from the start to finish which was disappointing.

Difficult to have a bad time here.  From the beer to the shuffleboard to the backyard to the nice customers.  A perfect version of a modern pub.  They also have some fun events on a regular basis.

The Diamond bar is the best bar in New York City. I've been a patron for over 10 years. They have thoughtfully curated beer options. The options change regularly but are always delicious. They have booze now, too. The staff is knowledgeable, funny, and simply the best around. The backyard is lovely. Only good things here. Stop by.

Fantastic bar, just a little unfortunate it's a far from the train. I'd say The Diamond is a harmonious marriage of a classy beer connoisseurs bar and a low key dive bar. The place is very clean, friendly, and fairly spacious. Don't expect Bud light here, they have a very unique beer list (tap and bottles). Their beer list is separated on three pages, Lightweight, Middleweight, and Heavyweight beers (categorized by abv%), prices range from a $4 Otter Creek copper ale to beers hovering around $20, most options are $6-8. Their food is limited to a few Tuck Shop ""pies"" , a cheese or pickle/olive plate, and another option or two. Their backyard patio is a dual level beauty. The space is great and has a fun enclosed ski lift car, not for the claustrophobic.

Lastly, one of The Diamonds greatest features besides it's back yard is it's full sized (and free) table shuffle board. Any bar that dedicates that kind of real estate to a game or games, gets an A in my book. If it wasn't for the beer prices and location I would have given them a 5 star rating.

I really need to spend more time in Greenpoint...

After the conclusion of an epic House of Vans concert featuring Future Islands (you really need to check these guys out) just down the street, myself and a group of pals decided to hit the nabe for a quick nightcap before retiring to bed. 2,000 concertgoers seemed to think they were all going to get into Northern Territory right across the street, so we pulled a fast one and headed north to The Diamond. It was one of the wiser decisions I've made recently.

It's a pretty simple bar with a nice list of beers, wines, and plenty of spirits to choose from. You can choose to sip these within the cozy confines of the bar or take your libations to the back patio for a relaxing hang on a handful of picnic tables or even an old gondola. And if you're a shuffleboard player, they take it pretty seriously here. If you've never played, you'll get a full tutorial by way of an infograph along the south wall. Again, they take it pretty seriously.

If you haven't been, you'll really dig it. Get in there ASAP!

We stop by this bar thinking they offer flight of beers but when we got there we will told they dont do flights. Nevertheless we stayed for a drink. We were there on a Wednesday night with only 3 other groups of people. Since it was a quite night we did not have to fight anyone for the shuffle board. The shuffle board was a good touch and the bartender is nice. It's a cute spot but there's a lot of other better spots around you can go to.

Definitely a nice place for locals, but not really anyone else. It's right down the block from House of Vans, but everyone kinda defaults to the rooftop across the street. They have beer and wine, and if you like anything else you're SOL. So, I was SOL and for that reason, and for the fact that I felt completely out of place (I'm actually from NYC and no, I didn't just go to college here) I don't think I'll be back.

We found this gem thanks to Brokelyn's Beer Book (30 coupons for beers in North Brooklyn for only $30). We can't wait to return to The Diamond! This is our new fave spot in Greenpoint. We came here at 10pm on a Thursday and quickly become fans. Friendly bartender (Will), unique beer selection, kind people at the bar, and a vintage red phone on the wall you can actually use were just a few highlights. Also, the backyard looked awesome.

While waiting in a depression-era soup kitchen line to try the release of Cuv√©e Noire at the Brooklyn Brewery, I met a sound engineer for a video game developer. We're making conversation and he starts describing a beer-centric bar with shuffleboard tournaments and Southern boiled peanuts that definitely sounds like my bag. What was really grinding my gears was the way he was eye-boning my half French+Cuban friend's chest the whole time. Then I remembered he worked for Rockstar Games, where if your boss catches you watching Seven Years in Thai Butt, she showers you with praise for your research ethic. We had words, he apologized and we made-up en route to the aforementioned brew-lover's lounge...The Diamond.

Beverages should be organized mathematically. Ranked according to alcohol % rather than the archaic Linnaean classification by origin. Mon petit ami used to say, ""I don't drink according to percentages, I just want to savor the taste."" Good for her, but somehow I got the body of an NHL player but the dainty stomach of a figure skater. I start at double digits and work my way down --

't Gaverhopke Extra: 12% Belgian Quadruple is the best alcohol bang for your buck at $10. It's so yeasty I thought it might give my mouth an infection.

Oktoberfest Drafts: available during fall, these 8% M√§rzens were tapped directly from barrels plastered with EU protected designation and Reinheitsgebot (German beer purity law) certificates. Best accompanied by $2 local brats served on pretzel rolls with whole grain mustard.

Sinebrychoff Porter: I hate every Finnish dish I've ever tried because they all taste like salty licorice. This 7% dark beer is no different.

I missed the complimentary Lombardi's pizza at the event but thankfully Frenchie and I shared common interests, mainly fatty/pickled/savory foods. Our ranks had swelled so we ordered assorted Charcuterie, Cheese Board, Pickle Plate and --

Brutus the Barber Beefpie: Aussie-style pot pie with chunks of meat, pepper-jack cheese and gravy named after this WWF villain --

d2tq98mqfjyz2l.cloudfron‚Ä¶

They picked the wrong dude to be a drug-free role model. I don't know what's going to explode first, his liver from the roids or his heart from the yayo.

Everything was going just swell. I was buzzing, full and happened to bump into some long lost high school friends, when Sammy Hagar showed up. How dare the Red Rocker show his face around me after the Balance album! I don't bring weapons into bars, so I grabbed the next best thing out of a nearby patron's hand...5 darts.

1. This one's for Red: My Uncensored Life in Rock. I wouldn't burn that book from fear the smoke would smell like shit. My hands were trembling with rage so I missed.

2. This one's for taking 4 minutes 42 seconds of my life with the I Can't Drive 55 music video and pierced his ear.

3. This one's for making Cabo Wabo Tequila so goddamn expensive and took out his right eye.

4. This one's so you'll never sing again and hit him right in the corner of his mouth.

5. This one's for just in case you recover from the last one and left him with one dangling from his Adam's apple.

When my anger subsided, I realized it was only a picture of the man that single-handedly destroyed Van Halen, on a cork board.

The management of the D does not condone displays of violence, so I was forced into time-out in the cable car outside. It was cramped in that little red t√©l√©cabine but Maybe Partying Will Help by The Minutemen was playing while I thought about what I did wrong.

I like the way the Diamond does business. The staff want to be there, the menu always has something new and something familiar on it and you can just be a kid again. A raging alcoholic kid that likes to watch girl-on-girl arm wrestling --

youtube.com/watch?v=qWD_‚Ä¶

Note to self, don't wager on half-Asians because you think their superior ability to strategize will lead them to victory. Place your bets on the 6' Red Sonja clone. I wonder who won the Women vs. Waifs (men under 145 lbs) challenge...

Stopped in here for about an hour during the Bon appetite grub crawl. The owners and staff were very friendly. I liked the outdoor patio area in the back as well... Perfect for a good weather hangout. The jukebox had unlimited credits when I was there, so I got to jam out to the few hip hop songs they had ... Mostly 70-90's rock.

Definitely stop in again while visiting .

Decent beer selection, ok food and one of the better shuffleboard tables in BK. Unfortunately, the bartender working on 7/30 was one of the most pretentious and snotty people I've ever come across. Complete stereotypical Brooklyn hipster clown and I won't be returning based on that (and some of the other reviews I'm reading now that claim the same thing).

This is a story all about how
My night got flipped by a bartender
Ruder than most
She didn't card my friend
Cause she ""looked older""
But wouldn't serve me
Cause I left my id at home
My bf tried to buy drinks for us both
And got denied
Even tho we're both 25
She was rude and unapologetic
She makes her own rules

Go to another bar on the franklin strip
You will enjoy yourself much more
I guarantee it.

Me: ""Do you have Stella?""

Bartender: ""No, we something exactly like Stella. It's as if we just put a different label on the Stella keg.""

The beer I got was absolutely nothing like Stella, in fact, it was wheaty and skunky. Sooo...either the bartender knew nothing about beer. (I hope) Or, he just figured he was so much smarter than the patrons of his bar he could say whatever he thought the patrons wanted to hear and they would be happy.

So as a New Yorker born and bred, and a recent transplant from Manhattan to Greenpoint, looking for a local place, I would never go back. Just another example of how this area of Brooklyn is becoming so ""hip"" that most places are off limits to the thinking New Yorker population. Real New Yorkers are just not smart enough to drink in Hipsterville. Sad.

I knew I was going to love this place the second I walked in. Mainly because the bartender was wearing a lady gaga tee - but also because the vibes were A positive. They just celebrated their 6 year anniversary... Perhaps going on 60.

Good vibes. Fantastic decor. And I can afford the drinks.

This is a cool spot to hang out with friends. Decent selection of drinks (no whiskey, tho). Came on a Saturday and it wasn't so crowded - the games are pretty cool. If you find yourself trying to go to a cool/chilled spot with friends, this is the place for you!

Great prices and amazing atmosphere!

My favorite parts of this place are the patio, beer selection and  atmosphere. It was divey without being dirty and the staff were super friendly. Super chill and a great place to have a drink.

The only downside was that there wasn't any shots available but... that was probably for the best in most cases

Great low-key bar on Franklin, at the end of a string of decent low-key bars.

First thing, GREAT beer selection without being a pretentious craft beer bar. They have a lot of my favorites here: Brooklyn fire and ice, Brooklyn East IPA, Koelsch, Schneider Weisse, and then a lot of beers that I didn't know would soon be my favorite. The beers are also well categorized by ABV percentages.

Also, in the winter time I love their mulled wine. They also have shuffleboard, darts, a nice outdoor area. Overall, great casual atmosphere. Its a little off the beaten path so it's never too crowded to comfortably order at the bar.

Great service, go out of your way to go here.

Here are some observations for The Diamond:

Great draft and bottle/can list, with beers arranged from session to middle weight to strong in ABV.

Beware of the floating Michael Landon head guarding the stairs.

The fire alarms are functioning properly.

The single bathroom needs better ventilation or an industrial strength air freshener.

The gondola can accommodate up to 10 people.

You will most likely not unseat the people at shuffleboard who were already playing when you walked in.

Accepts credit and offers meat pies.

The Diamond is a nice little bar in Greenpoint/Williamsburg with interesting decor. The curved wooden bar table is really nice. The bathroom is covered with cassette tapes from the 80s and 90s (when else really).

The beer selection is not particularly massive, but there will be stuff that most of you have not had (the beers I drank there had less than ten ratings). The bartender was a pretty nice person, and she seemed to be generally familiar with beer and was aware of the reasons why all the beers were chosen to be on the menu. However, she did play nothing but Nirvana for the three hours that we were there (one band wednesdays).

The place was not too crowded on a Wednesday, but it did not feel empty either.

The prices are generally pretty reasonable as well. Beers on tap cost between $6 and $8. The bottled beers were, however, more expensive. Fortunately, they do not serve Bud Light.

The food was good. The savory pies were tasty and filling and the pickle and olive plate was pretty tasty.

Free shuffleboard.

I would certainly go again.

This place is AMAZING. Hands down, I shit you not, amazing.

I'm a little biased, because this is where I had my first date with my fiance. A friend recommended it, cause if the date sucked we could always play shuffleboard.

Well we totally rocked that shuffleboard and had some amazing beers as well. All of the brews are delicious. You won't find any bud here, but you will find delicious, fine craft beers.

The atmosphere is great for not only dates, but as a good neighborhood hangout. Is it worth it to walk from the G stop to check out this place? Oh, yes! They have good tunes playing and from what I hear, some great food too. The bar is very bright and inviting, especially with the huge painting of Michael Landon's head, Little House on the Prairie era. The backyard area is definitely unique with a small, grounded sky car off to the side, horseshoe in the back, and enough picnic table seating to hang out with a group of pals.

The service here is also impeccable. I mentioned that I had my first date with my  fiance. We actually used the bar for a private engagement party this past weekend and it was spectacular! Sara, our bartender, was A+ and happily accommodated everyone.

Thanks Diamond! You guys rock!

Hands down, one of my favorite bars in town.

The place is beautiful on the inside.  Very cool curved bar, awesome mural on the wall by the SHUFFLEBOARD TABLE (!!!) some pretty sweet art hung on the walls and an overall classy interior.

The backyard is amazing.  They have an old gondola from a ski mountain up by Lake Placid (see my photos added).  You can sit in it and smoke ciggs.  Or you can relax on one of the many wooden benches and picnic tables.  They also have a horse-shoe type game all the way in the back.  The back wall of the backyard is an old factory wall with ivy growing all over it.  The picnic tables are painted this awesome vibrant orange color.  On certain days in the summer (i forget which days, sorry) they have a beer-soaked bratwurst cookout.  For $5 you can get these enormous bratwursts that are delicious and juicy and right off the grill.  No joke, these are so juicy that a bite out of one of these brats spewed a stream of juice and soaked my friend's shirt about 4 feet away.

The drink selection is great, and they often have a beer on happy hour special for $3.  Nice wine and liquor list as well.

My only gripe with this place is the cheese and charcuterie plate.  The cheese is off the hook....you get 3 small slabs of cheese with it.  The cheese is great, but the slabs are tiny.  Check the chalkboard, the cheeses rotate.  Sadly, the charcuterie is a joke.  You get one thick flabby slice of some sopressata that resembled spam.  Nothing sharp or tasty about that meat whatsoever.  The guy who prepared my plate when I ordered it seemed to have no idea how to hold a knife, and made absolutely no attempt to slice it thin (how cured meat should be).  For $12, I was unhappy with the plate.  I devoured it, but wouldn't order it again.

Other than this sopressata travesty, this place f*cking rules.

My home away from home. Dave & his wife are probably the coolest in the neighborhood. The steady stream of quality beer, the warm & unpretentious ambiance, the shuffleboard & the backyard keep me coming back. At least once a week.

Some things that add to this awesome-ness:

The Diamond is always teaming up with neighborhood businesses for benefits, be they dance parties or bake sales. I was there this past Saturday for an incredible event - Kill Devil Hill representatives DJing and pulling out raffle tickets. The prizes included wares from many Greenpoint establishments. Amazing.

And the kicker? $3.00 chili bowls on Monday nights. Delicious hearty dinner under 5 bones? Hellz yes! Paired with a happy hour brew, or a Southern Tier Winter for $5.00, you have a solid Monday evening pick me up!

I love you, Diamond. I hope you love me.

Yeah. I'm updating this...again!

Dearest Diamond,

Usually once I get close to someone I suddenly find myself repulsed, and cut off ties immediately. Over the past year or so, this has yet to occur. With each rendezvous I feel more and more attached, this bond...it's frightening.

You refresh me with your Sunshine Pilsner, you entice me with your stouts. You fill me up. With your meat and cheese plate. That thick, girthy chorizo. That creamy brie, the bleu...the parmesan tasting cheese. My eloquence, and memory has clearly been affected by the feelings you've stirred up.

But this past Tuesday...you did something that I will never forget.

Your pickles...they are the devil! Wondrous, spicy pickles...heat lingering in my mouth after we have parted. It's as if you wish me to be thinking of you at all times! My other lover would never forgive me.

Please, Diamond, I beg you...stay shiny. Stay with me. Let's keep this going as long as we can. It just...feels so right.

Love,
Yours Forever,
Passionately,

Briana

I guess I should update my review...

This Saturday I came here with a group of friends that mysteriously grew larger and larger. Which was unfortunate because the Diamond was the busiest I've ever seen it. The bar area was crowded with plaid clad hipsters struggling to get a pint or a glass of high quality beer. There was no seating to be had inside or outside, so we perched ourselves in a corner of the patio, which really should have more tables or benches.

This is definitely the perfect place to stop for a beer on a warm summer day, or evening. The bubbling of conversation is soothing (outside!) and never overwhelming. My only complaint is not within their control - the closing of the patio at 12:30 am. Boo! I just want to smoke my butts whilst sipping my brew, be it an IPA or a Banana flavored Belgian!

YEAH, this place is awesome!

Fantastic staff, excellent beer selection, great wine selection, amazing, amazing happy hour.  I love it to pieces.  It's a bit out off the beaten path, but that keeps the hoi polloi to places like Berry Park (WHAT is up with that place).  Totally worth however far you have to travel.

It is not a huge space, but it's perfect - laid-back crowd during the week and weekends it's crowded in a fun way, not in an ""I want to pull out my eyeballs with tweezers because I can't get a beer"" way.  Another bonus, the many times I have been there, nary a douchebag in sight.  Woo!

Apparently they had to retire the Ladies Arm Wrestling for insurance reasons.  But that doesn't mean it can't still happen, unsanctioned.  Who wants to go?

Only came here for the first time last night, but was definitely favorably impressed with:
A) the super mellow atmosphere (one other person at the bar at 7.30 on a thursday night, and a few more outside).
B) the obviously super smart beer selections, many of which I had never laid eyes on before, including the only italian beer i have ever seen which is darker than a peroni, and a fantastic Kolsch in 0.2 L, $3 doses.
C) way personable and friendly service from the bartender.
D) rows of cassette tapes lining the bathroom wall, at least as eclectic a selection as the beer
E) the CHEESE AND CHARCUTERIE PLATE. which apparently is changed up regularly, but last night included of an incredible old pecorino, an downright evil blue cheese,  and a near candy-like brie.

we can't wait to go back for more awesome beer and the very promising-looking list of savory pies!

Beer selection was great.

Not a huge food selection, but what they have hits the spot.

Bored? Not in this bar. They have a lovely dart board and a pool table that is placed strategically in the center of the bar. ****Please DO NOT place your beverage on the table***** the condensation from the glass will damage the fine solid oak.

I was here a few months back, and totally forgot to post about how awful it was as I tried to delete this place from my brain. You would want to as well.

The place is run by someone who is often drunk, and will yell terrible things at you (racist, homophobic, etc).

There is truly no reason to support a bigot who does not welcome all into his place of business.

This place sucks, played a gig here years ago and accidentally left my guitar, called and the bartender said they had. So the next day I go to pick it up and the owner wouldn't give it to me. He straight up said he had it, but wasn't giving it to me. A-hole stole my damn guitar.
Also have heard a ton of stories of the owner being racist and homophobic. This place should get shut down. Honestly thought it was or I would've left a bad review years ago. Don't support that jerk.

Just so it's clear the owner of this Bar is a racist and a homophobic asshole. He likes to stand outside and make racist remarks to woman of color on the street waiting for the bus. This place needs to be shut down! As you can see from other reviews the owner and bartenders harass their customers and people on the street. Greenpoint folks stop supporting racist business owners!

Negative stars. The owner is a known racist. Spend that drink money donating to a good cause or supporting a black-owned business before you literally give your dollars to racists. Don't support racism institutions like this one and spend your money elsewhere.

Can't wait till this bar finally goes out of business for good! Owner gets drunk and throws his own parties above the bar once a month. Disrupting the whole surrounding community.

This bar is run by a man who thinks it's acceptable behavior to yell racial slurs at his black neighbors. DO NOT SUPPORT THIS BUSINESS! Supporting this business means accepting that this behavior is tolerated. Black lives matter and we don't need a bar in our neighborhood that discriminates against people based on the color of their skin. We need safe spaces to congregate and celebrate and that cannot be achieved in an environment that leads with hate. Greenpoint is better than this so please make a statement by taking your business to bars that don't perpetrate racism.

Walked in this place on a Friday and it smelled like a dirty subway cart first of all. My girl went to use the restroom and as I was reading the beer list alone the bartender rudely asked ""can I help you guys"" while he finished his beer, I said I'm just taking a look as I waited for my group to join me after smoking outside. When they came in, not only 2 minutes later the bartender yelled and kicked us out without any cause, we didn't even exchange more than a sentence and he screamed from across the room to get out . Fuck this place Id rather drink in an alley way

This was the worst place I've ever been to! It smelled like a homeless person in there. The cherry on top was the horrible, drunk bartender's customer service. He was erratic and rude before I even got the chance to order. Other yelpers mentioned that proud boys met here. I hope this place does the community a favor and goes out of business soon.

The sign says $4.00 for the beer. They charged me $5.00 over and over again. Then mentioned they ""forgot"" to update the price on their list on their wall.

Also the bartenders insulted me to each other at the end of their bar. Did they not think that their LOUD whispers would not carry in a nearly empty space with no music playing?

I'm glad this place is closed everytime i walk by. IDK if it's for good but I sure hope so.

Note to all gays and friends of gays: if you don't like the idea that this place employs a bartender who feels totally comfortable throwing around the f-word, spend your hard-earned dollars elsewhere.

We spent some time here on Saturday night, June 4th -- two couples, one straight, one gay. We were having a nice time playing stupid songs on the jukebox and playing pool, having drinks and tipping accordingly -- until the female bartender (who was sucking down a spiked big gulp the entire time) jokingly called one of the patrons a word that starts with F and rhymes with maggot. I think we said something like ""Whoa whoa! That's some extreme language"" and she said, ""That's okay, he's my friend."" My boyfriend pointed at me and said, ""Well he's my BOYfriend, so please don't use that word."" She responded with something like, ""I should just keep my mouth shut."" (Side note: that's true.)

We probably should have left immediately because moments later she doubled down and intentionally used the same word again and laughed. We headed for the door, declining to leave a tip for the last round. As we were leaving, she shouted at the door, ""Thanks for the tip, MAGGOTS!"". (Except she didn't say maggots.)

If you are LGBT or love someone who is, avoid this place, and let your friends know the same.

To quote the great David Chappelle, what can I say about Tommy's Tavern that hasn't been said about Afghanistan, Its bombed out and depleted. What more could you want from a bar, classless, Panglossian yet Dismal and if Feng Shui were to manifest itself into human form and walk into Tommy's Tavern it would immediately Succumb to AIDS. Imagine the house from Fight Club and a dumpster from behind a Red Lobster in Louisiana in August in the mid days sun right before its scheduled pick up had a child, that child would be Tommy's Tavern.

What can be said about this gem.that hasn't already been said! This place harkens back to a time when Brooklyn was the center of the universe. If you listen carefully enough you can hear the whispers of the Tammanyites and the natavists. The barkeeps couldn't be more accomodating making sure the glasses are properly topped off and no request was denied. I even witnessed a quite dapper gentleman enjoying a refreshing Fanta. Don't pass this tavern up. You'll know you're home the minute you walk through the door.

This Tavern was great! The staff was wonderful, and very funny. I enjoyed them because they were real and enjoyed the customers company. The food was good, we would definitely go back. I would suggest anyone Who lives near Tommy's tavern to visit it often and support them.

I heard that this was to be my go to dive bar where I'm moving, so I was pretty excited that a friend was going to be playing a show. I walked in, and instead of the usual dark, cozy dives that I love, I was met with a pretty cold and uncomfortable atmosphere.

It feels as if the owners had at one time attempted to update the bar, what with the strangely shaped sofas and gigantic, digital juke box. There was just something totally off about this place and I couldn't really handle it.

The Schaefer was cheap, and their happy hour deals are good, but what's the point of sitting in a dive if you can't have fun? Guys, I just wanna get my dirty drank on and be done with it! Unfortunately, the female bartender had no smiles to give.

In addition to the unsettling vibes, a girl my friend knew showed the staff her passport to be served (she is 23), and they demanded her green card. She doesn't have one. She was VISITING. I've never heard of a passport not being enough identification, and at that point I was honestly read to leave. Pair all that with a shitty sound system, and the only redeeming thing about my night was the fact that a band playing (Eloise) rocked the house and there was a cab really close by for our speedy departure.

This place is loud yet empty, with a heaping helping of nasty. There's a back room for noise bands to do their thing in, and a front room in which aging hippies can wax nostalgic when they're not too busy looking at your legs.

You all are talking crazy talk! This bar is amazing. It just depends what you're looking for. Me? I'm looking for a real dive that reminds me of my former and beloved days in Columbus, Ohio. And if you, too, are looking for what I describe below, Tommy's is as good as it gets.

It's all of two feet by two feet inside, and there is poorly written graffiti on the walls decrying ""Tommy's Fuckin' Tavern"" or something equally ridiculous like that.  You will most assuredly get bashed in the middle with a pool cue, because most of the two feet by two feet are being used up by a very popular pool table. I was astounded to find locals of the Midwestern  type inside Tommy's - and can't help but wonder if these misshapen Iron Maiden-tshirt-wearing folk are in fact transplants from my beloved former place of residence. The drink menu for Tommy's is - wait for it - poorly scrawled on a piece of printer paper and taped up behind the bar. I ordered a beer in a can called a Schaeffer, and it was joyously anticlimactic. Tosh.0 was on the TV, but this was readily drowned out by such choice jukebox selections as Social Distortion, Metallica, and yes, Rancid. This experience was completed by the fact that some very rough-around-the-edges looking lesbians were making out in the corner.

Now, it might sound like the Midwest - and Tommy's - are places you never, ever want to go. And let me tell you, maybe you don't. After all, someone else's review says something is a bit ""off"" about this place. And it's true. However, this is by no means the epitome of the Midwest, just the seedy underbelly of the Midwest (endearing in the way that 1970s Times Square porn houses are endearing) that I have never seen before in New York... until Tommy's. My cousin and I walked by it looking for Saint Vitus a couple weeks ago, and though Tommy's doesn't havea  sign, some bearded down-home gentlemen were hanging around outside, and we both agreed that whatever that place was, it would be an ""Ohio bar""... and we right.

I'll be back, Tommy's... I'll be back.

I used to live a few blocks away from this bar, so I visited it a couple times. My experiences varied from scary to interesting. Once I saw glass and blood on the sidewalk outside of this bar and my roommate told me that it's nicknamed the ""stab bar."" One evening I was offered coke and a trip to Atlantic City by some local patrons.  I have since seen the woman that offered me a trip to AC outside of a laundry mat. I don't think she remembered me or the promised trip. I plan on going back to refresh her memory and see if I can still tag along.

After reading the reviews here was kinda scared to go meet my friends who were playing there. And it was a really fun night. No awful bartender, they were super friendly it was super divey and the crew that worked there was quite awesome. But I will say there was a man punched in the face and I DO think his nose was broken...but he was asking for it...

Wendy L. summed it up pretty well: I too saw a customer fight with the barkeep.  Some guy that was hopped up on coke slugged the female bartender and ran off.  I chased him down, got the police involved and then I was considered the narc and felt threatened in the bar.  This is the only place in Brooklyn I'll never return to.

Ugh. You mean Murder Bar? No thanks. It won some sort of obnoxious award from the Village Voice a few years ago for being the loudest bar in NYC.  Lately they've been doing what look like hardcore shows.  Drawing big crowds, and those folks seem into it.  It's just not my scene.

I went to a birthday show that was held here for it's dive-y atmosphere. From all accounts I would think that was the most people that place had seen in a single night- you'd think that the bartender would be thrilled at the prospect of all those tips- but it just seemed like she was pissed that she had to work at all.  Her mixed drinks were decidedly missing alcohol- and when I ordered a round of shots in honor of my boyfriend's birthday (okay, this may sound gross- it's half whiskey half Jager- try it!) she had the nerve to roll her eyes and make a snide comment... and then proceeded to charge me $7/shot.  Whatever- that was only $56... at least I saw her pour them, and it was actually alcohol (compared to my first drink).  I totally was stupid enough to tip her like $9- her attitude still didn't improve.  I mean seriously?!  Anyway, stick with beer and shots if you see the skinny, miserable blond with the tats behind the bar.

In all fairness, I gave this place two stars because there is a tiny backroom where bands play- the main reason the party was there.  It was cool to see bands (which were totally amazing) rock out in such a tiny space-  everyone can really get into the music and totally makes the atmosphere awesome.

Warning to other NYC bands! If you book a gig here be prepared to bring everything you own. The only thing this place has as far as equipment is a p.a. system and a barebones one at that. No microphones, a couple of shotty cables, and some mic stands. You'll be lucky if  you even get a sound guy to help you find the working cables in the rat pit of tangled chords and cables that are by the mixing board. You'll probably have to do your own sound too. Don't count trying to get a hold of the bar before your gig either. They'll never contact you back, and their website hasn't been updated since we were all using dial-up. I'm not saying we had a bad gig, because you can make it work, but this ain't like the other places you book gigs in NYC.  Beer was cheap, whiskey was watered down.
