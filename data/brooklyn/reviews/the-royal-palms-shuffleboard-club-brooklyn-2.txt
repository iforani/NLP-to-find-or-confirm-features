When: Saturday at 10pm
Party Size: 12

Came here for a birthday and had a blast. We rented a cabana with unlimited drinks and came out to about $65 a person. Great music, big venue, spacey, and a ton of fun.

Service: 10/10
The waiter stopped by every 10 minutes to make sure we had enough to drink. Great guy.

Overall: 10/10
Looking forward to my next visit.

I've been here before for a Yelp event, but never got to play or learn how to play. It is often packed on weekends with either long waits, or potentially no room for the rest of the night without a (paid) reservation.

My husband reserved us a lane ($100) so myself and a friend could kick of the celebrations of our birthdays. We had a nice time and the drink packages we had with the lanes were unlimited wines/beer/spirits for $20pp/hour I believe. They also had a few mocktails that were good and since I don't drink beer really, I ended up getting a bunch of those and mixing it with their bubbly white wine/champagne - those were yum!

We had a really great host/server person and enjoyed out time there. We had a nice booth and got take pictures in one of their designated corners with their fun theme and props.

They also have a nice bar and giant games like connect four in the middle or board games and such you can borrow from the front desk - fee or something I believe. It can be pricey if you're not really a drinker, but it'll definitely be a fun night out with friends.

Wow! Something really cool that I didn't have to schlep to Williamsburg for!!

I must be living under a rock, because this place is almost in my own backyard and it's taken me 5 years to discover it.

After being priced out at "private event" at a local BBQ place, rolling down Union street,  we stumbled in here and were pleasantly surprised!

It's big enough that even with a big crowd there is room to stretch out.
The music is cool and hip and the drinks are reasonably priced at around $7 and $8.    The crowd slants to the younger side of cool, but their were mid-30s people hanging with their boomer parents.   Plenty of side games like Jenga and Connect 4 to keep you occupied it you're not flinging discs.  $40 per hour and you can have as many people playing as you want.   It's just a nice alternative to bowling in a stunning space.

Royal Palms is a daydrinking and birthday party favorite, and after my visit I can understand why. It has a pleasant Palm Springs meets old-school ocean liner vibe, as directed by Wes Anderson. There's the requisite cans of Montauk Brewing Company and cocktails in mason jars. It can absorb huge groups.

And importantly, it has shuffleboard. It's a good group activity in that people can swap in and out easily, it doesn't require a lot of strategy (or even hand-eye coordination), and sobriety is not an essential factor in your success.

Unfortunately, the wait for lanes can be long-- we came on a Saturday afternoon when the space wasn't super packed and waited maybe 45 minutes for a lane. It's about $40/hr for the lane, but I think you can pay more to reserve a cabana and lane in advance. I think 2-3 hour waits are the norm on weekend nights otherwise.

There's a lot to do while you wait, including Jenga and card games, as well as an indoor food truck to soak up the alcohol. It's a fun idea for a friend hangout where people can come and go. Staff is also great and have a well-practiced spiel on the game.

Prices can rack up here if you're looking to ball out, but it's not unreasonable assuming you split court fees among 4 people. The crowd is fairly basic; people are here to take Instagrams, naturally. (The bathroom is unmissable-- the flamingo wallpaper is by far their best investment.) But the vibe is not bad. I have no burning desire to go back, but I'd be happy to get invited to another birthday party here.

Wholesome fun for adults! Great, chill, aesthetically pleasing vibes. Very unique concept.

A friend continued his birthday celebrations here (as a walk-in) a couple of weekends ago but unfortunately we never got to shuffleboard. It was a busy Saturday night so not surprising that there was a long wait list. If you're serious about playing, make sure to book in advance or come during a less busy time... otherwise you'll be pretty disappointed. We, however, still had a fun time and I just loved the ambiance. I'd recommend coming here to hang out with friends, coworkers, family even if all the courts are full. There's ample seating/tables, plenty of board games (we played Cards Against Humanity), big Connect 4, etc. Also, drinks are average priced ($12-$13 for cocktails in cute mason jars), food is available for purchase (didn't try any), and music is loud in the open, airy space.

Conveniently located right in between Pig Beach, Ample Hills, and Dinosaur BBQ -- all very close and walking distance for a fun pre- or post- game meal/dessert. Super poppin street.

Spend a friend's bday here. We reserved the shuffle board court for two hours and paid for the unlimited beer and wine. The game was fun even though no one properly played through a whole match. Our server was super prompt and brought our drinks right away. The cava, ciders, and IPAs they had were perfect!

They did aggressively kick us out of the area right on the end of our paid time.

This place is so fun!! I've been with friends and brought my parents separately. Theres something for everyone (21+). You can play boardgames or other things like wall-ring toss while waiting for a lane, or just to hang out. Theres a nice bar and drive-in food truck for dining options. The staff is friendly and will explain the game to you. Dont forget to take some silly photos with props  (near the bathroom). Its not cheap but its worth it!

I'd never played shuffleboard and never would've thought to play shuffleboard if my Union hadn't hosted an event here. It costs $40per hour to play a game. 4 people can play on one board. It you don't know how to, the staff is kind enough to explain how you play. Outside of the shuffleboard, there are jumbo connect 4 games and other board games you can borrow. Go with a small group and have a game night out! They serve alcohol but no food. They do however have a different food truck that  services the establishment for one week each month. The night I went it was a tasty meatball truck. I'm curious to see what other trucks they partner with.
The atmosphere was great and offered some picturesque areas. Give it a try!

The Royal Palms is a fun place to go with a group for during the day! You're able to do fun activities such as shuffleboard, connect 4 and other board games. You can also drink too!

Just an FYI, if you want to play shuffleboard, prepare to wait a while. You would have to put your name down and wait about 2 hours and then you get a buzzard and wait another 30mins or so.

***The only thing I'm upset about is that you have to give them your ID to play games/shuffleboard and they lost my friends ID. If you're going to take someones ID, you are responsible for it. They legit gave it to someone else or misplaced it somewhere. Not going to lie but it's annoying to replace an ID and having the hassle to go to a DMV.

Other than that, yes this place is fun for a group outing.

I've been wanting to go here for years, and I finally got the chance last Friday. Our initial plans for the night hadn't panned out so I decided to go over to the Royal Palms Shuffleboard Club.

The space is HUGE. All the shuffleboard courts were taken. We took a number, and when our number was called, we received a pager. Interesting. The wait ended up being about an hour. According to the site, play time is limited to 1 hour so more people can play.

While waiting for a court, we played some of the free card/board games available. The drinks are well priced, near dive bar prices. And a food truck area is available as well.

Once we got our court, an employee came and taught us the rules of the game. We had a GREAT TIME. We played til closing around 2am. It's a bit pricey at $40 per hour, but worth it.

I definitely want to come back

The Royal Palms Shuffleboard Club is my all time favorite place to bring folks who are new to NYC and are just visiting. They have everything!!!!

Drinks, unlimited board games, giant Jenga and giant connect 4, shuffleboard, the only catch is that they're out in Gowanus, but that actually makes it better because it reduces the amount of folks that would actually come here and makes you appreciate the amount of personal space you can get.

Came here a couple of weekends back and had a great time with friends! We came late afternoon on a Sunday and the place wasn't too busy so we didn't have to wait long before a shuffleboard court opened up. Don't fret if you've never played before! Once you get to your court one of the staff members will teach you the rules, which was extremely helpful. It's $40 per hour and they'll let you know when you have 15 minutes left.

They also have an abundance of board games that you can play and life sized connect 4 and jenga. Lots of activities to keep everyone occupied! There's also a bar with killer drinks.

Highly recommend coming with a group of friends. Can't wait to go again!

I'm a big fan of any *sport* I can play while still holding my wine. So if you are trying to decide between some sort of activity or a night out at a bar, you now have a very cool middle ground.

I have been here twice now, and both times with some sort of group, so I think it is along the lines of $40/hour for the actual game. But you're obviously going to be playing with friends, so when you divide it up, it's not that bad. If you don't plan on playing but just really like the vibes (the vibes are pretty great) then you don't have to! You can just hang out, drink wine and beer and cocktails from mason jars, and take it all in. Besides shuffleboard, they have giant Jenga, and a few other little activities. They also have a food truck/stand with some decent options. I tried the chicken sandwich and wasn't in love, but curbed my hunger until we left.

I think you'll be pleasantly surprised by how fun the game actually is. It's fun, it's easy to pick up, it's a great and different way to spend a night out. Every inch of this place is photo-friendly but there is a photo booth available to ensure you get the perfect shot.

Honestly, it's 5 stars for me simply because it is a really out of the blue way to get together with friends.

Super fun place to be. $40 a hour but I think its worth it. It's a good activity to do with your friends. It's a simple game so it's a great activity for everyone to do.

There is a rotating food truck parked inside the place. The night we came it was Korean food. It was quality and very delicious. It was a bit pricey but it was a company outing so I didn't have to pay for it. Otherwise... I might have gotten food elsewhere. It was about $14-15 for a bowl.

Super fun. Tip for parties - the clock starts the second they give you instruction. Don't waste time getting food during your hour. Start playing right away! Eat before or after

What a very cool concept and great place to hang out. Games, beer, and a lively crowd. The bartenders were friendly and made some great concoctions. You could rent a shuffleboard space for $40 which included one hour rental for up to ten people and a lesson. What a great deal. They also had giant connect four games, Jenga, and a ring game. The music was lively and kept you jumping. This adult playground was full of energy.

Had a great time celebrating my friends 30th birthday here today.  You have to wait some time to play and it's a bit pricey ($15 for a small plate of food from the truck) BUT the food was delicious and the drinks were good too and this is to be expected at a popular party place. A lot of great photo opportunities and enough space to not feel crowded. Also a lot of games to take and play.

Super fun for groups! I came here for a work party on a Thursday and it was pretty empty. My coworker said he came on the weekend and it gets super crowded. The space is huge! It looks like one of those refurbished warehouses.

I always thought shuffle board was lame and one of those things you only get into when you're on a cruise ship or retired in Florida. Surprisingly it's actually a lot of fun!

Great for those who want to master a new skill and also accommodates to those who are petty and want to knock the opponents disks off the board. For those who aren't into shuffle board they have other board games and life sized jenga which is always a blast. Great times all around!

$95 per person might be steep but it gets you a blast of cool a/c for 2 hours, a private cabana, and a private shuffleboard to play on so you can really agonize over how hard to push a small disc so it lands exactly on the small square of space that reads "10." Oh, and all you can drink drinks including beer, wine, rose, and well drinks (moscow mules and whisky neats were really popular with our group). Staff are funny and friendly, and super helpful with teaching the rules of shuffleboard. The interior is awesome -- pastel-decorated so you feel like you're stepping into a 1970s cruise ship. Lots of other fun games on the side like XL connect-four, and a photo booth with tons of props. The bathrooms are clean and plentiful and Amber Hills Creamery plus a rotating set of delicious food trucks are available to fill your tumms with.

It's cool that they have this entire place dedicated to shuffleboard. Definitely unique! When you enter, the whole place looks like a giant pool separated by lanes.

There is an instructor who teaches you how to hold and use the stick as well as general rules of the game. I came with a large group and we only had one shuffleboard, so we took turns. It's not as easy as it looks! You often push too hard or not enough. People seemed to lose interest in the game pretty soon though, and most of us just spent the rest of the night eating, drinking, and talking.

The food truck that was there the day we went sold sandwiches, burgers, hot dogs, and fries. I had a hot dog and fries and both were subpar, especially the fries, which were bland and were not crispy.

The Royal Palms Shuffleboard Club is by far one of the coolest spots in Brooklyn and all of NYC. They run an outstanding operation here where one can indulge in a variety of things: killer drinks in a lounge'y atmosphere, fun interactive games like giant jenga, while hosting all sorts of events, and of course, a one of a kind operation around shuffleboard.

This place is so fun that even a novice shuffleboarder is deemed be an enthusiast after the first go-around here. It's an easy game but like many things in life, best enjoyed with good company. RPSC makes for a good date option, an awesome group fun option, a cool people watching spot, and generally a great place to visit for all folks. Personally, I think it's a great alternative to the usual nightlife scene and adds a dynamic venue to already impressive variety that Brooklyn has to offer.

I give kudos to their staff who do a bang up job night in and night out. Management keeps this place fresh by hosting a whole plethora of events and makes it so that even each night can be a whole 'nother experience. Sometimes they have a live band and a lively dance floor and other nights it's all about food and mingling.

It can get crowded on the weekends and I highly recommend calling in ahead of time for big groups if this happens to be a special occasion or friendly large social gathering for shuffleboard. Either way, this place is a flexible and fun options for all those who choose to partake.

Unfamiliar with the area but walked there from kick axe on the company's idea. Walked in not really knowing what to expect. It's a huge room. Multiple shuffle board lanes on each side or a large aisle that ends in a bar. In the far right corner is a hole for a drive up food truck. On the left side is a lounge area where I'm assuming a live band plays. Strange tropical decor and funky lights. There's another much smaller bar on the left sid of the building. Each lane has poles, pucks, chalk and boards to keep score. Quickly learned how to play and it was actually quite fun. We got pretty competitive in the late night hours.

This place is good for big crowds and group events. To play games you have to pay- which are a little pricy in my opinion. There is food, but from a "truck" which is inside the place and sometimes they run out of certain things.

This place is DOPE!
Atmosphere here is the key word. Solid music. Good vibes. A really great aesthetic and layout to play some awesome games.
They've got a bunch of games here that make this place even more worth going than just shuffleboard (boardgames of all types).  The bar was well stocked, and it was a lot of fun!
$40/hr per court, and no reservations for groups less than 12. Sunday night is the night to go if you want to actually play a lot / chill, as there are a lot more free courts then. Fri/Sat apparently have a really packed vibe, but I'm sure it's worth the time anyway.
Beer was reasonably priced, $6-8 a pint.

I remember flying down to Søuth Florida, unsupervised and unaccompanied I might add, to visit my grandparents on school breaks from 1986-1998.  I was always spoiled rotten with amazing meals, mini golf and arcades every day, and unlimited swimming.  What I really loved to do more than anything though, was play shuffleboard at their best friends condo complex right next door.  Maybe 10-year-old me thought that I was winning every game because I was a hustler, or maybe it was just my grandparents, their best friends and their neighbors all letting the visiting grandchild win, but I felt like I won every game I played on these visits.

Sadly my grandparents have since passed, and until recently there were few places to slide biscuits (play shuffleboard), but when I first heard of Royal Palms, I knew a visit was inevitable, so when my friend from Baltimore told me he was coming up for a tour of New York's best bars, I insisted we make a stop here, and boy are we glad we did.

Interior is roomy and vast, with fans and colors that ooze Søuth Florida - light teals and pinks abound, flamingos and other tropical minutia decorate the space.

Ashley is the beverage director and she has put together an outstanding program with delicious, kitschy offerings, including the Shuffleboard Bob (a wonderful batched cocktail with Gin, coconut water, lime, Peychauds, and a refreshingly sweet cucumber syrup), and the Smokey Gigi (ancho Chile infused Mezcal, two kinds of shrubs and lime juice).  Both were delectable, and on my next visit I will be having their Earl Ball...

Each day different food trucks come in to provide sustenance, check with them for who is there on a day you plan to go.

One hour of play is $40  no matter if you're solo, double or a group of 4 or more, and there is no prorating, so you Pay for the whole hour even if you play for less time.  That being the case, I suggest going with a foursome so it's $10 per person.  Each court time comes with a brief free tutorial so you know the rules and regs, and before the tutorial is over the instructor challenges you to slide a perfect biscuit (land a 10 pointer) and offers free shots for the whole group if one of you lands it - a fun challenge but very hard to do (he gave us a second chance halfway through our court time)

You apparently get free court time if you're in one of their leagues ($500 per season per team, $100 per solo), and honestly if I didn't live on Long Island I'd have signed up for a league on the spot - that's how chill the vibe is here.

Don't want to slide biscuits? You can play giant connect four, tabletop shuffleboard, one of 5 dozen board games, or Bimini ring toss for free, or, just grab a lounge chair and pretend you're in Hallandale Beach.

Royal Palms you've made a fan for life, see you again really soon!

Spacious but drinks taste terrible.

They have lots of games including cards against humanity, Jenga and such.

Must be 21+, ID is checked at the door. Shuffleboard is $40 per person.  The games were fun but the drinks suck.

First time shuffleboarding and I must say this was a fun new experience which I wasnt good at.  We were here on a work day trip.  The drinks were pretty good and strong.  Oh also there's a food truck spot built in on the side of the shuffleboard club.  Note: the line is LONG no matter what, but also worth the wait because the food was so good.  It was Korean BBQ this time. I believe the food trucks changed semi frequently, not sure how much.  So you may not eat the same food here twice.

Want a photo with the flamingos? BE PREPARED TO GET KICKED THE F OUT.

I ended up at the Royal Palms Shuffleboard Club this past weekend, around 12:15AM on Sunday morning. Along with a large group (~30) of wedding guests with the bride (my sister) and groom, we made our way from 501 Union to this establishment. All of us were admitted without any issues, which is evidence that they did not think anyone in the group was at the point of inebriation that would have restricted our entrance otherwise. While we had placed our names to queue for a shuffleboard court or two, a friend of mine and I noticed the flamingos to the left of the bar and decided to take some photos. My friend pulled out one of the step stools (spoiler alert: these were apparently jenga stools -- some of which were not properly labeled as such) for us to get more leveled photos with the flamingos and both of us took turns taking a photo or two. At one point, one of the female bouncers had been there attempting to fix the line/separator that dictated the area patrons were not to cross over to (the stage where the flamingos were). She had been having trouble resetting the barrier so I assisted her and asked if we were ok taking our photos. She said there was no problem as long as we did not cross over the line. My sister and her friends made their way over shortly to take some photos while we were waiting for our court as well. They did the same, some on the step stools, some below to create levels for the pictures. Almost immediately a male bouncer, along with the same female bouncer from earlier came over and started yelling at us to "finish our drinks and get out". I calmly approached him and asked what the problem was. He said we should not have been standing on the jenga stools to take our pictures and that we all had to leave. We were all in shock because we did not know that this was prohibited or we would not have done it in the first place (stool-level pictures with flamingos are not on the top of my MUST DO list). I profusely apologized and explained we were not aware and that my sister had just gotten married and we were just trying to play some shuffleboard and have a good time. He was not having any of it. I asked to speak to the manager and he said the manager was the one who told him to kick us out immediately (NOTE: If you are the manager or the owner, I would appreciate a prompt follow up with your first-hand reasoning as to why we deserved to be kicked off the property). I brought up the fact that the female bouncer did not tell me there were issues with us using the step stools when it was just me using it to take a photo but somehow as soon as 3 people were using them, it was an issue? She denied saying this thereby throwing me under the bus which was completely uncalled for. I would have expected a stern "Please don't stand on those step stools, they are used for people to STEP ON IT for Jenga, not for photos" warning. These are step stools that PEOPLE STAND ON FOR JENGA. IT IS MEANT TO BE STOOD ON. While we stood on them for a different purpose, I believe the sentence far outweighed their opinion of our "crime" (please note the heavily sarcasm-drunk quotation marks). He began to kick out the rest of our party who were in the middle aisle between the courts even though they had done absolutely nothing wrong (only 7 people had been in the photo and me and my friend had taken it). They lost out on roughly 30 people's business that evening for no good reason. My opinion -- the bar was likely over capacity and they were looking for an easy out to rectify their careless mistake and picked on the one group who they could do it to swiftly. This male bouncer continued to yell at our entire party all the way out. His level of boorishness and uncouthness was completely unceremonious. Only a handful of people in the party (~3-5) had had enough time to procure a drink so we were clearly not being kicked out because of drunk, rowdy behaviour (otherwise, they wouldn't have let us in to begin with). This barbaric treatment put a massive damper on what had been a beautiful night and it was completely uncalled for. I am keen on speaking to management because that kind of treatment felt extremely selective (I am Asian, and many in the party were of minority groups) and it causes me to wonder how much of that played into it. I am still in disbelief and hope ownership reassess their staffing strategy for security. Put them through training on how to treat people with respect or simply provide the definition of service and hospitality, since they clearly lack the aptitude to grasp those meanings. See below for the photo we had taken before they kicked us out for anyone curious to see the "crime" that was committed so you too can pass judgement on if we should have been kicked out.

By the way, we ended up walking to Givers & Takers and they were WONDERFUL. I *strongly* recommend you head over there instead of this poor excuse for a business.

There's nothing quite like it anywhere in the city! It's a huge space, great for big groups -- with about 10 shuffleboard courts, tables scattered, board games, 2 bars, and usually a food truck for the nomz!

The weekends are always so packed, so be prepared to have a very long wait time. If you don't want to wait, I suggest you come right when they open. Otherwise, you could estimate up to 3-4 hours. It's a great place to just chill and drink/eat too!

Coming on the weekdays is a whole different story! You can also reserve courts with a bigger party so everyone has a chance to play.
If you're a noob, they will gladly teach you how to keep score and how to send the shuffle down the board! It's so much fun and requires zero athleticism!

If you're looking for something to do or have visitors, I highly recommend coming here!

We passed by this place many times and each time it seemed like a real fancy schmancy place because of the security at the door and the attire of people going in. We finally went on a Friday night at around 8pm and found it to be surprisingly not crowded and pretty casual! We just moved to the area from Florida and this place does a great job of capturing the sunshine shuffleboard state. Since it was just the two of us, it was kinda on the steep side in terms of a date night- $40 to rent a lane for an hour plus any drinks or food- but it was so fun and easy (once the staff explained how to play). We didn't try the Korean food truck that night but it's a really cool concept that keeps you inside to get your food. We'll definitely bring our out of town friends and family next time!

This is a great place to go if you love being rudely spoken to by the staff and forced to leave for taking photos!!

We went to this establishment for a wedding after party. Our group wanted to take photos by one of the displays, which we had asked one of the staff if it would be okay to do. She said it would be fine as long as we didn't touch the displays. One of the security then came up to us and told us to leave for taking photos. Despite knowing that we had done nothing wrong, we had calmly apologized to this security personnel who rudely told us to finish our drinks and leave for taking photos. He had said that he didn't care about our explanation, and insisted that we were wrong. Despite telling us to finish our drinks and leave, he then followed us and told our whole party to just leave our drinks on the table and leave, then proceeded to kick out the bridal party of 40 people. This man and his accomplices were extremely rude and obnoxious.

Took me back to the time I played Shuffleboard with my Grandpa in Sunrise Lakes (Phase 3)!!

What a fun concept.   I live in S Florida, grew up in the 80s/90s, and was in town visiting family who lives in Brooklyn.  Went here on a cold Sunday afternoon before my flight home.

First, it's 21 and over.    I do think they should open this up on a Sunday for families, but that's me..although I didn't have my kids with me on this trip (adult play time).

Place inside is a trip.    All Florida 'kitsch'.   Even a big orange bowl, which might be from the actual Orange Bowl.   Old pennants from cities in FL adorn the wall.   All the chairs were those rubber straps just like my grandparents had at their condo.     Food truck..check!

Upon check in we were told it was 1 hour wait til play.    We said ok, and glad we did.  I made my way over to the Bimini game..and frustratingly played it (still so much fun).    Think we created a buzz cause others who maybe didn't know about it came over and jumped in on the action.   Then we found the giant connect 4 game.   Wife edged me out on a 2 out of 3.  Need a rematch.    Oh, did I mention full bar and beers on tap?

One hour is up...our turn.   We got our instructions (refresher..hey, it's been a bit) and shuffled away for an hour.

I loved the place and it's concept.

I was able to bring SWAG bags for my party, and sit and have a few sips in the cabana. We also had fun at the photo booth...Treat yourself!

Formerly great bar now beholden to finance bro's and Greek life reunion parties. This place is a capitalist hell hole. Would not leave my drink unattended.

We came here for my friend's birthday party and had the best time. If you're planning to do the same, request  Kristin as your server/mentor --she was incredible. Attentive, kind, helpful, funnand funny--she made the experience next-level spectacular. The drinks were also amazing (and strong). We will absolutely be returning. Thank you Kristin for elevating this great experience!!

One of my girlfriends did her birthday here and we had a blast! This place is in Brooklyn, not too far from the F train. Easy to get to and has a neat barbecue spot and ice cream spot next to it.

We booked a cabana because we wanted to make sure we would get a shuffleboard and have a place to put our stuff down. We paid $50pp for our AYCD well drinks/beer/wine package for 2 hours.
They have giant sized Jenga and a bunch of cool board games you can also play if you dont want to shuffleboard.

The guy who taught us how to play was great! He was an amazing server and made our time there a great time!! Kudos to Steve (I really hope that's his name, but if its not, its the "skinny Jack Black"). He helped us get drinks at the bar so we didn't have to get on the line ourselves. He helped us when we didn't understand the rules of the game. He also constantly checked up on us with a huge smile and made sure we were enjoying ourselves. Please give this man a raise!!!
