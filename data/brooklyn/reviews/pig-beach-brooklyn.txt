I was back in the city for a mid-COVID return and needed to make a Pig Beach stop, if only for the pre-pandemic nostalgia. The construction going on next door and very tight COVID restrictions make Pig Beach feel a bit apocalyptic, but I appreciate their caution. We waited for other guests to leave, then they took temperatures and had one of us write down our info for contact tracing if needed.

The food was just as incredible as I remembered. I had the pulled pork sandwich both times (last visit was summer 2019), and the mac and cheese side (HEAVEN - I legitimately dream about this mac). Last time it had goldfish topping and this time it was Cheez-Its. Incredible. I got the cornbread side last time, which was great, and went for the coleslaw this time around. I forgot that they give you coleslaw for the sandwich already, so ended up taking the slaw side home for leftovers, but all was delicious and I'm honestly drooling thinking about it now...

My ONE tiny downside was that the bun for the pulled pork got really mushy and fell apart. Maybe a sturdier bun would be better. But honestly such a minor complaint compared to how finger-licking delicious everything was!

AMAZING ! Meat heaven. The brisket sandwich, the wings, the CORN BREADDDDDD (if there is any left by time you get there) IT IS ALL AMAZING !

Due to Covid- Mike the host, keeps the line moving. He is informative, and a grand entrance to this food heaven. (View mike in photo attached ) during this visit GOTHAM BURGER SOCIAL CLUB WAS a vendor (10/11/20) and if heaven could have visits that what having Gotham burger social club was like.

I loved to the Bronx within the last year and for my 2 year anniversary I planned a date to PIG BEACH because the food and vibe is THAT GOOD .

Yes - alcoholic drinks
Yes - dog friendly
Yes - kids friends
Yes to being too full to get home

Pretty good place, great vibe to hang out and eat (only for an hour), but little expensive and not many options. I'd like to see combo platters, 1/4 lb or 1/4 racks, and a bread side. My true rating is a 3, but giving them the benefit of the doubt during this covid time. I might come back to try some of their sandwiches.

Coleslaw: best thing out of what we got. Light, crunchy, with a very slight kick.

Brisket: got a mix of fatty and lean pieces. Tasted pretty good and goes well with sauces.

Ribs: Wet sauce pork ribs seemed fairly tender, maybe a little over cooked. Not sure if they have an option for dry or beef ribs.

Mac n cheese: nothing special, sauce seemed kind of too wet.

Pig Beach was definitely a hit! I had planned to have BBQ with a friend at another established in the area but it was all booked. Thanks to Yelp, I was able to do a quick search and do what I like to call, "turn the beat around". Yelp gave me a few options but I selected Pig island and I'm so glad I did.

After arriving at Pig Beach not to be confused with Pig Island which is another event in the area, I put my name on the waiting list. On a nice summer even, waiting list are to be expected especially when BBQ is on the menu. Not to worry tho because while waiting, you can enjoy one of their fabulous drinks and might I add, their fros√© is fantastic.

So after waiting a bit, we were seated and we're promptly given the ground rules of ordering both drinks and food. Like most places now, there is Qr code menu or you can always review it on your phone using Yelp. I got the ribs and my friend got the brisket and wings. The BBQ was excellent and the drinks were equally as good. The menu has a few sides to choose from and I'm sure you will find one that will suit your fancy. Mac and cheese is always a favorite of mine, a guilty pleasure in the mist of carb counting. I'm a big fan of BBQ and Pig Beach will be placed in heavy rotation for the remainder of the summer.

Hospitality is spectacular! I came here with my boyfriend and the host was very clear with the protocol. On each table, there's a bar code. You scan the bar code and it shows you the menu. Once you know what you want to order, you walk up to the food line and order. Same thing goes for drinks, you have to go to the drink line for drinks. If you step away from your table to get on line, you need to wear a mask.
We ordered the pulled pork sandwich, fries, pickles, pig beach burger (double) and cole slaw. I highly recommend the pig beach burger and the pulled pork sandwich with pickles because it's the best meals on the menu! Cocktails were very delicious and perfect. Will definitely come back before the summer is over
Bonus points: you can bring your dog and they provide them with water!

OH MY GOODNESS.

Brisket is bomb. Sauces are bomb. The spot is bomb. Staff is bomb. I need to come back to get the ribs, because it looked like heaven.

I am so glad my boyfriend picked this spot. I have been craving good ol' American barbecue for the longest. LONGEST. After work and before heading to an archery spot, we made our way to Pig Beach and it did not disappoint. He loved his Pulled Pork Sandwich. I loved my Brisket Sandwich (hands down my favorite sandwich). We tried all the sauces and they were amazing! Key Lime pie was a classic and the cornbread was alright (not bad but not my favorite). Still a good treat. You get to stuff your face with all these flavors and it doesn't cost you much. I would recommend anyone that loves barbecue to come here. I can't wait to see how this place gets lacked in the summer. SERIOUSLY VISIT THIS PLACE!

Went out first time in 6 months, and I must say pig beach was the right choice of venue to break the quarantine ice. Place is very strict on following the social distancing and mask protocol, host is super friendly and informative yet assertive which I truly appreciate. Food is delicious, My husband and I had double burger and fries, friend had pull pork sandwich and we shared Mac n cheese and cold slaw.... all was DELICIOUS. The place has super cute outdoor space and they are dog friendly which is always great addition as that allows everyone to bring the most important member of their family.

***Pre-COVID*** Fun place to both people and dog watch, Pig beach is especially fun on the weekends when the young NY-ers come out en masse to drink and hang out with their friends in a trendy part of BK. The food is fairly good, although sometimes you're left eating standing up with your group until you can all squeeze into a picnic table and eat elbows in each other faces. I guess it's part of the charm - very modern brooklyn feels, with cute string lights and happy chatter all around. Would recommend the brisket, pretty well done and not too dry. Pork shoulder (at least the piece we had) was pretty dry and tasteless unfortunately. Seat and serve (utensils and tap water) yourself, first come first serve seating. Cute first date or family gathering place, potentially!

Went here with a big group of 11 around 5pm on a Sunday and while it was relatively busy, we were able to find a round table in the back that fit all of us. We ended up ordering food for the group and sharing and it was DELICIOUS. The ribs and the brisket were two of my favorites but quite honestly I thought all of the meats were cooked well and flavorful. We also tried the pull pork, the sausage with cheese, and the wings (moving this up to one of my favorites as well!) The bbq sauces were all distinct and tasty. I thought the original was great with everything. We got almost a full loaf of sliced bread because of the amount of our order. Mac and cheese breadcrumbs were goldfish (stealing that idea), fries were super well seasoned and crispy. Cornbread was fine, probably the least favorite for me but still decent and with all the other stellar food around it didn't really matter.

The monkey drink was also great. Place was spacious, food and drink were memorable, and service was quick. Will definitely be back again!

Pig Beach. Is. AWESOME.

- barbecue has tons of choices and is decently priced and tastes really good
- Got the brisket sandwich with Mac and cheese small side for $16, would recommend both items
- Went during November so not crazy crowded but bar is big and well-staffed and place is clean
- Good beer selection and overall environment
- This place lives up to the hype!

A hip spot for cool kids who like bbq food and drinking outdoors. The entrance leads to an outdoor area with tables, benches and two bars. When I came last summer, the place was so popping that navigating through the throngs of people and their dogs was almost as challenging as my first five road tests (I passed on my sixth try). My friend spent a good 40 minutes lining up to order a drink. And then my party spent another hour trying to place our food order indoors, which also has a seating area. It was slightly less crowded inside but still extremely loud. The four of us got the sample platter to share with one side of mac & cheese and one side of Coleslaw and sausage on top of that. The staff forgot our ribs, which turned out to be the best part of the meal! I'm usually a mac & cheese fiend but this one didn't spark joy. Honestly, we didn't stay too long after our meal because it was just not a good place to have a legit conversation.

The BEST barbecue I've had ever!! Although this place is definitely a bit of a trek from manhattan, it's totally worth it. My friend and I got the Mac & cheese, cornbread, brisket, ribs, and wings. The meat was perfectly cooked and juicy, even the next day after spending some time in the microwave!

Definitely a great spot to hang out with friends. We came on a Sunday, so they were playing some football games. I don't really follow the sport, but it was definitely easy and fun to get caught up in the vibe!

Such a great place! We went here for an early dinner on a Thursday - our first time going out to eat in 5 months!

It felt very social distanced and relaxing at the same time! Menus via QR code, food and drinks via counter service and big picnic tables to sit at.  You pick up your food order when your table is called.

We ordered pull pork and brisket sandwiches, Mac and cheese, and fries. We enjoyed all of it.

Service - The service is the same as any fast causal place that you can go to. You go to the register to order your food and you are given a buzzer to pick up your food when it is ready. Nothing out of the ordinary with a place this large.

Food:
Sampler Platter - Perfect for Two. My eyes are ALWAYS bigger than my stomach and I have become more indecisive the longer I look at a menu, so it is great that they curated a platter as a menu item instead of  making me choose a protein. Even though the menu says "1/4 Rack Ribs, 1/4 lb of 3 meats", the 3 Meats are already listed out for you on the menu onsite (Pork Shoulder, Brisket, Turkey). I would get this again with the side mentioned below!

Mac & Cheese w/ Goldfish - Creamy and nostalgic. This is some great mac & cheese. Shells are my favorite shape to cup the cheese. The addition give you a textural change when eating something so creamy! Two thumbs up like a bad dad joke.

On to the next food adventure...

As the summer winds down, made it a point to come here to enjoy the outside BBQ atmosphere while possible. Saturday late afternoon (sometime between the lunch and dinner crowds), still a significant line to enter.

Was able to get to the backyard area after about 10ish minutes in line. Place is generally packed both inside as well as outside - including a large portion "Reserved" for various parties. With nowhere to sit, opted instead to lean on one of the bars and order some drinks. The initial stall as you walk in has some cans, where I opted for an IPA ($8). Towards the back there is a bigger bar that I did not know had a better drink list. Inside, you can order food - settling on a Brisket Sandwich ($9) and some fries ($6 for a small). Meal comes out within a few short minutes - a small but dense sandwich packed with some brisket, fried onions, and pickles. Juicy and flavorful, but wishing there was more. Fries are fresh but completely over salted, which the beer couldn't whisk away.

The flaw here was coming on a Saturday afternoon; it is way too packed to enjoy a meal, even despite the bouncers regulating the crowd. May try again on a weeknight.

The smoked turkey was on point. Mac and cheese was superb. The bbq dipping sauces were also pretty dope, but completely unnecessary. The turkey was just that good.  Worth the trek.

Not pumped about the backyard bbq feel. It felt very cafeteria- like. And the beer was meh.

Tips:

Go for the food not the drinks or atmosphere. Next time I'll get take out.

Or go later in the evening to avoid the lines.

Great outdoor space for dogs and when the weather is nice! I'm originally from Texas so can be picky about my bbq. The food here is good, but not the best I've ever had. It definitely satisfies a bbq fix though!

We got the platter that had a sample of everything. The brisket, ribs, chicken, and turkey. Brisket was tender, ribs weren't as fall off of the bone as I would've liked, chicken was flavorful, and turkey was a good light option to balance it all out. All of their sauces are really good and pair well with the meats.

First off.
Omg omg.

The food was great. The brisket was soft as can be.  The Mac and cheese was great. They use crushed goldfish on top of the Mac and cheese. Omg.

The price was good. The drinks were great. The views were great.  The clientele was ehhh.  Come with a big party.

All in all 4.5 stars from me.  Brisket was on point.

Came here to watch an Ohio State game and were asked to leave at halftime to open up our table, despite other tables being open. What a terrible experience for an OSU game.

Solid spot! We got there early after Brooklyn 1/2 marathon and I'm so glad we did! It filled up quickly and by late afternoon it was so so packed. I loved how large the area is- there was inside seating and large picnic table area located out back/outside. A lot of puppies and babies, good mix of guys and girls of all ages and most importantly a lot of bus boys running around clearing tables. There was even a guy at one point directing the bathroom line when it was so long.... I liked the food options and selection although they are Grade Pending and last I saw they were rated a C. Yikes!

I tried to ignore that and the table ordered a bunch of things, from chicken sandwiches to wings and ALOT of fries. I thought prices were reasonable and would highly recommend for a large group, just get there early!

Do they have best bbq in Brooklyn? Probably not...

But I love the vibe of this place. Outdoor space, good selection of beer, dog friendly, (no vaping though).. Its perfect for a chilled crowd of 4 to 8 people.

We got the ribs, pork shoulder and brisket. The rub and seasoning were great, but the meat was on the dryer leaner side comparing to other top bbq joints.

The brisket and cheeseburger had little to no flavor, the beans tasted really good though. The sauce that came on the side for the brisket was good too.  The burger was the size of a slider.  Pretty disappointing based on how good they make their food look on the gram.  I'm given them 3 stars BC the guy who took my order was nice and seemed like he might've actually grew up in BK.

What a fun spot in Brooklyn! Pig Beach has a huge outdoor space with several bars to cater to patrons (beer, wine, cocktails, etc). There is also a spacious indoor area. It's a casual restaurant - order food at the counter and then grab a seat. Dogs are allowed in the outdoor dining area.

The bbq is great. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich, mac 'n cheese, and cornbread. I was happy with it all. My friends really loved the wings and pork shoulder.

The staff were all lovely. I stopped by on a Sunday evening where it was busy but not overly crowded. I'd definitely return.

Ahhh finally made it to the famous pig beach (in Brooklyn not the Bahamas lol)
Having heard so much about this place I was so excited to go. It seemed like everyone around me had tried the yummy food and raving about their Fros√®!

First let me start by saying I would have given it 5 stars, but I felt the drinks were overpriced ($14 a pop) and there were no specials particularly for it being a random Tuesday.
Please don't let that deter you, their frozen drinks were delicious. I had a fros√® and it was so refreshing (check out my pics to see the yumminess)

Now to the food! AMAZING! We shared a sample platter with a side of fries and Mac&cheese. The sample platter offered a little bit of everything, ribs, shoulder, brisket, turkey... sooo good and offered such great BBQ flavors! I have to mention the sides because the fries were the best I have had in a while. The Mac&cheese threw me off at first because it's topped with gold fish crackers but omg what a perfect and almost genius combo!

We will be going back for sure!

Great place for a birthday party. Came here on a Saturday for a friends birthday and the place was absolutely packed. There had to be at least five other birthdays going on as well as an ohio state football game. Lethal combo.

Great vibe, great food and nice people. There tends to form a line at the entrance so if your friend ya a name on the list, use that. Otherwise it moves fairly quickly.

There are only three potential things not to like about Pig Beach:

1. It gets crowded on nice weekend days, because you're not the only person that wants to eat delicious barbecue and drink in the sunshine at a beautiful venue that can fit all your friends. That's what everyone wants. If you don't like good places being crowded, move out of NYC. Or stop complaining.

2. It's not quite as cheap as you probably want it to be. That being said, you're a notorious tightwad, and the fact that you want them to be serving drinks at dive bar prices with the insane rent they are probably paying...it's laughable. Yes, cocktails are $14 at a barbecue joint, but the basil watermelon thing was delightful. Or you could just roll with a few of the beer/shot combos that come in at $12 and you can still get plenty drunk, you lush. (They also have an excellent selection of brews on tap.)

3. The BBQ sampler platter doesn't come with sides. But you know what it does come with? Lots of meat. For $35. And you can buy sides, and they are damn good. From mac and cheese to pickles to slaw, they are an excellent complement to the tasty ribs, brisket, pork shoulder, turkey (all on the sampler), wings, and sausage (add-ons that you should add on).

That's it. Those are all the things you could possibly not like about Pig Beach, and in reality they are things I don't like about you.

Otherwise, this place is about as glorious as it gets when it's sunny out and with the revamped indoor area, not too shabby when it's raining either.

I'll be there on the weekdays, so I can avoid you.

Went here with a friend to grab a bite to eat on a hot summer night. Getting in was pretty easy--no line at the door around 9pm on a Friday.

Then the luck continued at the ordering counter--literally we were able to order right away.

Then we grabbed a few drinks from the bar and found a spot outside to sit and the food buzzer rang--very quick!

We decided to split the sampler platter and a large side of cole slaw. The sampler platter had brisket, turkey, shoulder, and ribs. I would say that the brisket and shoulder were my favorite as they were the most tender. The ribs had good flavor, but not much meat on the bone overall. And the turkey was fine, but definitely much better when doused in BBQ sauce. I also really did enjoy the cole slaw as it was super refreshing and had great flavor.

We also had a rose cider and some sort of cucumber vodka drink, which were both decent as well.

Overall, this place has everything down to a science. The food is great--not the best BBQ ever, but pretty good--and the drinks are easy to order and decent as well. The drinks were a bit on the pricey side, but I guess for the ambiance and experience of eating outdoors, that's what you pay for. Nevertheless, we enjoyed our night out here and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for some tasty BBQ or a place to eat/drink outside.

Quick recap: if this place was simply a bbq joint, it gets 3 stars. Food is good but much better options for just bbq out there; however this place is so much more. Awesome spot to come and hang with friends at the bar or beer garden.

The bbq itself was good. The highlight being the brisket which was tender and juicy. Definitely the best thing I tried from the sampler. Also be warned, the chicken sandwich seems to have a small kick of heat to it.

However good or bad the food is, there's a beer garden here as well. So much open space, delicious cocktails, delicious beers. And live music at times, makes this spot so much more than just a bbq joint.

Service prices and cleanliness was all on point. Definitely a spot to check out and enjoy if you're in the area.

When the juice from the meat and the sauce run down your fingers and you lick your fingers and say wow at the first bite, you know you have a winner for a Burger. One of my ultimate comfort foods is a burger and I'm a little bit of a burger snob.

The signature Pig Beach burger topped w white american cheese,  secret sauce and pickles on a martin roll is just plain awesome! There's a reason these guys won burger bash 2019.

The meat is perfectly cooked and so tender to the bite. I easily could've had another one

Highly recommend  their burger. I had the double patty which is $11. The single is $8.

Excellent! Everything about Pig Beach reminds me of Texas - the outdoor seating, the barbeque, and the casual but fun vibes. It's a fun spot with great outdoor, communal seating space.

The line for food and subsequent preparation time were both short. On a Friday night, it was very busy, but it's still pretty easy to find room to sit outside. I tried the brisket sandwich, and it was delicious. I found the portion size to be a little small. The side of house pickles was good, but I wouldn't get it again. The sampler platter looked amazing and like it was a good value for two people to share. There is a good mix of beer and cocktail options at the bar, which is in a separate line from the drinks.

We had a really enjoyable experience at Pig Beach.  Is this place my absolute favorite BBQ spot in the New York?  No.  But they do serve up some solid 'cue in a hip environment!

Also, be aware that when you decide to dine may impact your overall experience.  We're not into big crowds, loud parties, or hanging around a bunch of drunks.  We went on a late Friday afternoon and were greeted by a bouncer who informed us that smoking and vaping is prohibited on the property (we neither frequent places with bouncers nor those that have explicit instructions re: smoking - so that was something new!).  The crowd was mixed.  Lots of families, dogs, and young and old alike.

We ordered the brisket (delicious), hot dog (pretty standard dog), wings (excellent flavor, but it was served room temperature - which is questionable), baked beans (yum), and French Fries (yes please!).

Overall, a solid time and well worth a visit.

I came here with a few friends yesterday and it was okay. The ambience is great, everyone's super friendly and chill, it's dog friendly which is great!

I wasn't impressed by the food, I ended up getting the brisket and I thought it was too dry. The French fries were okay, nothing special.

The have 3 different bbq sauces, thy were pretty good, considering I soaked them in my brisket.

The drinks were good, but overpriced for a place like this.

All in all an okay place .

I had been wanting to go to Pig Beach all summer and go figure I randomly end up making it in the Fall when the outside area is closed. I am almost certain that I came here before this place was called Pig Beach and it was another name. Anywho I had a pulled pork sandwich and brisket. It was good but I think it's fair to say that this place is overrated. I have heard so much hoopla about Pig Beach and I just don't think it met up to the superior expectation. Perhaps its the combination of food and outdoor space that people love but overall this place is just A-OK in my book.

This bbq spot was delicious. I shared the sampler platter and got a side of sausage Mac and cheese. Their bbq sauces are awesome they range from tangy to spicy. I am in love with their ribs. They Turkey was tasty and not dry. The brisket melted in your mouth.  The Mac of cheese could've been more cheesy but the crumbled gold fish crackers on top added the extra cheesy flavor. However, I loved the creaminess of it.
The sausage was good too and was stuffed with cheese.

The wait was not long at all it may have been about 5 mins on line with about 5 people ahead of us and the food was ready in 5 mins. There is a huge outdoor area which was packed like crazy but I was able to snagged seats for two quickly. They have two extensive bars one inside and one outside. Their cocktails were tasty and potent.

I definitely will come here again maybe earlier or another day of the week when it's not as crowded.

Great pulled pork sandwiches and drinks! The Mac and cheese side is not bad either. The brisket and wings were tougher than I'd like, but might have just been an off night.

Overall, food is a 3.5, but I'm bumping it up because of the large, dog friendly outdoor space with corn hole. This was perfect for hanging out during a weeknight. However, I'd avoid coming here during prime lunch / dinner hours on a weekend because it gets insanely packed.

Absolutely love this place. The only thing you can potentially complain about is wait times and over crowdedness if you come during peak times. But the place is huge and depending when you go can have 3 full bars open at once so you should be able to get drinks quick enough. The drinks themselves are good, nice variety. It's great that they have both indoor and outdoor space for people, and TVs for people who want to watch games, as well as cornhole for those who want to play them.

For me, this place gets 5 stars because of the food. My recommendation is to come with a group, order a bit of everything and just pig out (no pun intended). Their wings are deliciously saucy, and super juicy. Ribs are fall off the bone and heavenly. Nice touch to add gold fish to the Mac and cheese to add some flavor. Overall no food choice is a bad choice, so just try it all.

I brought my mom here because we both love good barbecue and I wanted to check this place out. We arrived in the early evening on a weekday so it wasn't crowded at all. Before ordering we had a beer at the bar inside and then headed over to place our orders. I had a burger, brisket, and baby back ribs. My mom ordered brisket, ribs, wings, and the mac and cheese with crumbled goldfish topping.

The burger was a bit on the small side but the flavor was outstanding! Seriously, one of the tastiest cheeseburgers I've ever eaten. I would go back just for the burger and order two of them. The brisket was juicy and the ribs were tender and delicious. I didn't even need any additional sauce on them.

My mom raved about the wings and she also loved the macaroni and cheese with goldfish. Cold beer + good barbecue= Happy Summer!

This BBQ joint is Bro and Basic central, calling all from Murray Hill and Fidi to day drink in this meat market.

If you own a Patagonia vest or only shop at madewell, this is your place. If that's not your style (me) but you still want the food, there's a nice little room to the right that is way more chill, and also family friendly. If I decide to pop in to get some smoked turkey, you'll find me there.

Pig Beach is nestled in Gowanus. I swung over after a rock climbing session @ BK Boulders. It was a Sunday night, yet the vibe was still lively and bustling.

The concept is like most BBQ joints... Pick your meats and order by the lb, with an ample open outdoor space. I was with three friends so ordered quite a bit. We went with the brisket, sausage, pulled pork, and a chicken sandwich. Out of all these orders, I found the chicken sandwich to be the tastiest. Granted, I did live in Dallas for a year+; this BBQ does not stand up to that level.

Overall, it's a great spot to chill with friends, grab a drink, and eat some decent BBQ. This 4* is largely due to vibe and interior.
