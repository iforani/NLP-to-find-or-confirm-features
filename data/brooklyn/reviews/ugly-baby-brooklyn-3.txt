We just tried the food at Ugly Baby at 407 Smith Street (Carroll Gardens/Gowanus) and it was amazing! It's the best Thai food we've had in the States. Hands down. Spicy AF but oh so good.

We've been trying to support small businesses especially our Brooklyn restaurants during this COVID-19. Thankfully AMEX is doing a small business promotion where you get $5 off a minimum purchase of $10.

The overall headline-- this food was AMAZING. This, my friends is the REAL DEAL. As soon as we got to the car with the food, you could smell the aromas of spices from the bags. It was absolutely heavenly. Honestly, I think it is the BEST MEAL we have had all year. Definitely the best since COVID-19 hit.

We ordered:

Kanom Jean Kiew Warn Gai- Rice Vermicelli & Spicy Chicken Green Curry- $18 Spicy, so spicy but oh so delicious. Such a yummy mix of chicken and veggies. The liquid gold was out of this world. Initially I was let down by the portion size but to be honest, it was the perfect amount in the end. I would have preferred rice instead of noodles but it was so so so so so good. (Is that too many so's?)

Khao Soi Nuer- Northern Egg Noodle Curry Soup with Beef Shank- $18
Also spicy-- these dishes are NOT for the faint of heart. We liked that they didn't water this down at all. Every bit full of flavors and heat. But so delicious. It came with various toppings to add in including the porkskin. It was a really nice touch.

Tue Ka Ko- Fried Little Coconut Milk Cakes with Black Bean & Taro- $9 Sweet but not too sweet. Little muffins of tasty goodness. The sweet sauce that came with it -- divine.

Bonus Drinks- They gave us to Thai Iced Teas for free-- which was nice and as we chomped down on the meal--well appreciated given the heat! They were a little too sweet for our liking but that was easily remedied in a few minutes after the ice melted.

So, we plan to go there again (and again) to try other things on the menu. We ordered 30 minutes before closing so they had sold out of everything on the specials menu-- maybe we will call earlier to get something from there next time.

Our hats off to the Chef!

Best Thai food in NYC, bar none. And probably the best restaurant in Carroll Gardens. If you haven't been--why? You are seriously missing out. This is the closest you'll get to a trip to Thailand right now, and the people that work here are the BEST!

Yes, many of the dishes are spicy! Very spicy! But not all: try the tumeric fried sea bream or the little coconut cakes if you don't want spicy at all; go for the khao tod nam klook (sooo good) if you want a little heat. And get some Thai iced tea to soothe your tongue! They also have to-go cocktails and wine.

It's carry-out only rn due to covid, but SUPER fast (15 min wait on a Friday night), everyone wearing masks, safe, clean, easy system to pay. Love this place so much.

Aug 20th 2020 - Better than ever, and here's why...

To say that we've been huge fans of this restaurant since the day they opened would be an understatement of epic proportion.  We love everything about Ugly Baby!  The food, the staff, the creativity and uniqueness, to the heat and their fun sense of style.  It's all authentic and truly one of a kind.

Now Yelp has been pretty inactive since Covid-19, but I am compelled after having yet another epic and delicious meal delivered to Brooklyn Heights that I want to make sure y'all know that UB is open and still making incredible food... and BEST OF ALL... are the weekly specials!

Every week it's something new, and it's ALWAYS worth trying a plate or two from the specials menu!  So while currently they are only doing take out and delivery, please know you have to take advantage of the weekly specials!  We have been ordering weekly and we are consistently delighted in an over-the-moon kind of way about how exciting and delicious these dishes are! The specials change every week, and that keeps it *very* interesting, and it brings us back for the following week.

A neighbor of ours didn't realize Ugly Baby delivered up to Brooklyn Heights (check deliver range map below), so please check their delivery range map!  They post weekly specials on Instagram under the name uglybabynyc.  Check it every Thursday!

To those wanting for a place to start, we suggest going with the Fried Turmeric Sea Bream as a must have.  We order it every week, it's flavorful and addictive beyond belief and not spicy hot.

That's all for now; now go get some Ugly Baby!  :-D

June 4th 2020 - first experience with delivery service after COVID-19, and...

Our taste buds are resurrected, rejuvenated, and rejoicing thanks to their delivery service to Brooklyn Heights!  Hallelujah!!!

What a meal!!!  Frankly I wasn't even terribly hungry before eating and once I started on the Duck Salad I realized how much I really missed Ugly Baby.

In addition to the Duck Salad, we ordered the Sea Bream, Shrimp Squid & Salted Egg Yolk, and the daily special of grilled hanger steak & sticky rice.  Seriously 10/10.

We also had a bottle of the Farnum Hills cider, which is always a perfect pairing to anything on the menu.

Thank you so much, we love you guys and your food!  We'll be back next week.

We just came back from Ugly Baby tonight and again - no matter how many times we go - they just never cease to amaze and delight us with their wonderfully delicious dishes!

It just so happened that tonight was their one year anniversary of being opened, and although we go way back with many of them to the original Kao Soy days from years ago (see below for the whole story) it is just stunning that they still continue to impress and even surprise us with their wonderful cooking.

I would also be remiss to not mention a word about the staff.  Not only are they all very attentive, but they are warm and genuine people.... and FUN!  You can see everybody is really happy to be there, and qualities like that count.  It's just good Mojo!

We always leave with a smile on our face and a satisfied appetite. And then we immediately talk about how wonderful each dish was!

So we had dinner for two.  Here's what we had:

1) Laab Ped Udon aka spicy duck salad.  A great way to start a meal!  The heat is here, and we want it!  Such a wonderful array of tastes all in one lovely dish.

2) Pla Tod Kamin aka fried turmeric sea bream.  Always one of our favorites, we pretty much always need (not want - need!) this.  It's a whole fish with seasoning and flavors to die for.

3) Nuer Ping aka beef skewers.  This was new for us - and WOW really so tender and tasty, so flavorful - ok we just finished dinner and I am not hungry - but I am truly salivating just thinking about it right now.  No exaggeration.  I think I always need this.

ALSO - Congratulations to the entire staff for making the September 2018 bon appetit Top 10 list of America's best new restaurants!!!  #3!!!!!  That's a nationwide list.  This is the only restaurant in NYC on the list.  It's a lovely piece on the restaurant, well worth the read.

To Chef Sirichai, thank you.  To us, you are not just a chef.  You're a great artist that just so happens to use food as a medium.  Your food and your entire staff always makes us happy!

To the staff, thank you.  Without your hospitality and wonderful spirit the food would not taste quite as good.

Thank you all!!!  Ugly Baby will always be our favorite restaurant!

WOW!!!

OK, so we were huge fans of the original version of Kao Soy and Chiang Mai in Red Hook.  When Chiang Mai closed, we were really bummed out, but we were told they were going to open another restaurant in the future so that alleviated some of our sorrow!

In subsequent months we tried other Thai restaurants, nothing was nearly as good as the food we had grown so accustomed to and loved so very much.  We *really* missed Chiang Mai...

Month after month we would check Chiang Mai's Facebook page desperately trying to find an update on the status of the new restaurant, but there was little information.  And then.... after a year or was it two years?... FINALLY!!!  Our wait was over!!!

Ugly Baby!  What a great name!  We went to the website and learned that the dishes are based on cuisine from all different regions in Thailand.  The prior restaurants were focused on Northern Thai food, so this would be something new and exciting!

Literally the next day we went to Ugly Baby, and we were so happy to see all of the familiar faces we missed so much!

We looked at the menu and didn't know where to start.  We went with several suggested dishes, knowing we would be in good hands...  and then..  our first dish was presented...

Kao Tod Nam Klook - curried rice, pork skin, peanut & ginger.  And with the very first bite, oh... my... god!  The wait was over!  Such flavor... oh my... so yes, we both decided we could eat this dish every single day and never get tired of it!

Gai Golae - southern style chicken thigh skewers.  Amazing!  Chicken so tender it almost melted off the skewers... wonderfully flavored...  really superb.

Khoong Muk Kai Kem - shrimp, squid & salted egg yolk.  Simply delicious.  Need to have this again.

Kang Hoh - northern dry Hung Le & red curry paste with pork shoulder, spare ribs & mungbeen noodles.  Fantastic!!  Really special.

So that was dinner for two, and we absolutely loved every dish equally.

All of these dishes present a symphony of different flavors that seem to have a beginning, a middle, and an end!  It's not just one note of flavor that stays consistent throughout the plate.  It's a symphony for the tongue!!  It sounds crazy but it's true!

We didn't think it was possible, but Ugly Baby is even better than the former restaurants.  We can't wait to go back and try the rest of the food on the menu.

Thank you Chef Sirichai!

TL;DR - If you want the best Thai Food in NYC go to Ugly Baby.  Period.

Spice junkies near and far - I have found your temple. Ugly Baby is not just any Thai restaurant. If you think you have already eaten the spiciest Isan Thai food you could find, think again. I know this because I asked how spicy the spiciest dish (Kua Kling) here was and the server just laughed to himself. However, fortune favors the bold so we dove headfirst into the fiery dishes to come.

You can probably start things slow with the Tue Ka Ko, which are fried little coconut milk cakes with black bean and taro. This is a great appetizer to prepare your palate for the volcanic flavors to come. Next up on my first visit here was the Laab Ped Udon spicy duck salad. If you want to consume your dishes in escalating heat order, then this dish should be eaten last. This unassuming salad will set your taste buds ablaze, but oh it just hurt so good. Same with the Kua Kling Southern dry eye round curry. This and the duck salad could go toe to toe in a heavyweight spiciest dish boxing contest.

If you can still read the menu through the tears in your eyes, other great options on the menu encompass noodle dishes, rice dishes, and fish. The Khao Soi Nuer Northern egg noodle curry soup with beef shank is probably the way to go in the noodle department, wonderfully creamy and savory but also devilishly hot. The Pla Tod kamin fried sea bream also helped somewhat in cooling our mouths as did the Kao Tod Nam Klook curried rice.

Sensitive stomachs be warned - Ugly Baby may not be the place for you. For the rest of us, every dish is expertly prepared and bursting at the seams with flavors - spice included. If you cannot get enough of spicy food, Ugly Baby will truly put that to the test. If you can make it out alive, you will want to keep coming back again and again.

Review for visit before COVID-19. This place is open for pick up (and maybe delivery) so please support!!

Guys let me tell you, brunch is THE time to go! We came here at 1:30pm on a Sunday. It was my first time but the couple I'm with have lived in Carroll Gardens for 5 years and said that they've never been able to just walk in and get a table. Note that the restaurant closes between 3-5pm.

Not completely sure but it seems like a family business. The person who took our order is super knowledgeable and I love that she gave us suggestions based on our questions and recommended complimentary dishes based on our order. I love people who have an opinion about the food they serve.

In terms of food, here's what we had:
Tue Ka Ko -- Fried little coconut milk cakes with black bean & taro. Really good, I highly recommend. Little bites of heaven (almost like a muffin bite but better). Not overly sweet and the black bean adds an interesting component. It's supposed to be an appetizer but I basically saved one for after the meal to help combat the spiciness and almost serve as dessert :)

Kao Tod Nam Klook - Curried rice, pork skin, peanut & ginger. SUPER delicious, definitely very flavorful and different from what you'd probably expect. There was less rice than I'd expected, a lot of flavor and spice. I think this was probably the spiciest dish out of them all. There was literally basil leaves still on the stems, super fresh. I personally enjoyed adding it to each bite but I like that you have the option yourself. Almost like DIY!

Kang Hoh - Northern Hung Le, red curry paste, pork shoulder & glass noodles. I think this is the name / description what we got? Although what we got came with pork skin and also sticky rice. The pork shoulder was good, but nothing super amazing. There was also bamboo shoots from what I remember. The different components came separately instead of mixed together like I expected.

Khao Soi Nuer - Northern egg noodle curry soup with beef shank. This is probably THE dish everyone gets when they come here. My couple friend broke the crunchy pieces to soak in the curry. Looking back, I actually would've preferred it not broken and pushed in because it all just became soggy. I missed having that crunch with the noodles. Don't stir in the spicy stuff on the side if you can't handle super spicy! Overall, I was disappointed by this dish. I liked the Pig and Khao once (before they got a new chef in 2018) and really wanted this one to be better.

In summary, definitely worth a trip! But not sure if it would be worth anything over a 30min wait.

We got the memo that they serve REALLY SPICY Thai food probably around the third time they informed us of that, as we pored over the menu. They were not wrong; there was a good amount of heat in some of the dishes, and they don't entertain any requests to tone it down.

My favorite dishes were the shrimp/squid in salted egg yolk, and the green curry. We ended up pairing the salted egg yolk sauce with any garnish that was available by the end of the meal - because it was AMAZING. Overall, I thought it was a solid 4.5 stars experience - great authentic Thai food, fresh modern decor and cutlery, topped with personable and honest service. Can't wait to be back.

1. Kanom Jean Kiew Warn Gai (rice vermicelli & spicy chicken green curry)
2. Sai Tod (fried pork intestine & Jaew)
3. Laab Ped Udon (spicy Udon Thani's spicy duck salad)
4. Khoong Muk Kai Kem (shrimp, squid & salted egg yolk)
5. Moo Hong (phuket stewed pork belly)
6. Kang Prik (spare ribs & bird's eye chili curry)
7. Durian sticky rice porridge

Before coming to Ugly Baby, I read all the reviews (and warnings). I even planned a short trip to Ample Hills for dessert and wore a shirt underneath my sweater in case the sweats came on too strong. I'm happy to report that I made it through intact. If you are not a huge spice freak like me, it's imperative to order a good balance of dishes and highly recommended to share (the party next to us ordered individual entrees and I could see sweat dripping down their face throughout our dinner service).

We ordered (in order of increasing spice levels): the Kao tod nam klook ($17), Sai tod ($12), Khoong muk Kai kem ($20), and Khao soi nuer ($18). It's hard to pick a favorite because they're all singularly delicious but complement each other well.

The sai tod, crispy fried pig intestines, could be lightly spicy if you choose to eat it with the jaew, a smoky dipping sauce made of dried chilis, cilantro, and lime. It's a great appetizer to get you started for the rest of the meal.

The kao tod nam klook is a savory and tart rice dish that features crispy pork skin, crunchy peanuts, fermented isaan sausages, and loads of ginger. As one of the few non-spicy options, it comes with raw cucumbers, string beans, and lettuce which are very useful when quenching burning tongues. Overall, it provided a refreshing respite to the spicier, heavier curries like the khao soi nuer. This intensely aromatic curry noodle soup was well-balanced, with the heat slowly creeping up on you as you continue slurping the wide egg noodles and beef shank bites. The pickled mustard greens and the sweet fried bits sprinkled atop the khao soi helped to counter the heat but this is where munching on a cucumber from the kao tod nam klook would come in handy.

The Khoong muk Kai kem, an intensely savory but equally sweet stir-fried shrimp, squid, and salted egg yolk dish, comes with a side of rice. As the dish is lightly spicy, the rice is great paired with the seafood or as a palate cleanser in case you run out of raw veggies to cool your tongues with from the khao soi. To be fair though, the staff is pretty attentive about refilling your water (as well as providing recommendations if you're unsure what to order).

Overall, the spice was not as punishing as I expected it to be. Instead, it was nuanced and balanced well with the other main flavors in Thai cuisine; salty, sweet, and sour. This was some seriously sublime Thai and I look forward to returning and trying out the rest of the menu soon.

According to my foodie Thai friend from Bangkok, this is likely the best Thai restaurant in the city. She knows her food (not just Thai) and I trust her judgement.

Lucky for me I moved into the neighborhood and have been able to dine here on a few occasions and even get takeout during this Covid pandemic.

Spicy food is SPICY, they will warn you as best they can so don't take their warning and suggestions lightly. If you love spicy like I do you won't be disappointed and the flavors STILL come through. Delicious offerings with carefully crafted classics and delicate touches... a true adventure for the palate. Not everything on the menu will set your mouth ablaze, there is variety but if you don't like spicy, you will be a little limited. Southern Thai food is known for the Thai chilis that bring these dishes their heat.

Among my favorites are the Squid with Egg Yolk (exact name escapes me), Sour Pork, Khao Soi, and if you dare Laab Ped Udon (spiciest thing I ever ate). Their dishes vary in flavor and yes despite some of their spice, they are still full of flavor. Their menu changes and they do not take reservations so put your name down and grab a drink somewhere.

A feast for the senses and a far cry from most "Thai" food Americans are used to.

Delivery was just as delicious as on site dining.  Food was sheer perfection of earthy heat, spice, tang, crunch and cool snap. From the weekly special menu, we ordered the Yum Mamuang which featured fresh Betal leaves which you wrapped around sour mango, ground pork, peanut and coconut.  We loved it and hope they will feature it again.  From the regular menu we ordered three favorites; Kang Hoh, Laab Ped Udon and Khao Soi Neur. The Laab is the spiciest and you smile as you cry a bit eating it!

Phone service was quick, friendly and helpful, ready to explain any dish and make suggestions ordering.  We placed our order at 4, they start cooking at 5, and our order was delivered at 5:30.

Check out their delivery area map.  We were super happy to see Brooklyn Heights included.  Weekly specials, of which there are several each week are posted on Wed on their Instagram account.  But don't be tardy, the specials run out!

Next time we will order Thai beer or wine to go with the meal to put the bow on a perfect dinner.

Another 5 Star meal with bold, complex, spicy flavors.  No dish is ever quite like another!
The menu had some new updates since I last dined here and tonight we had:

Kang Hoh - since these tender chunks of pork shoulder were my favorite dish last time, we ordered it again, and again hands down no quibble delicious!

Stingray in curry - sweet, juicy stingray in a very spicy curry that did not overwhelm the perfectly cooked fresh fish.

Beef tendons - a base of tendons, noodles in sauce, bean sprouts and peanuts, cicharronds, fried wide noodles and cilantro!  It is a brilliant combination!

Truly amazing, tastebud dazzling dishes with super friendly efficient service.  I had take out the first time and walked 1.2 miles in the cold home because but I was determined to give them a try and not eat somewhere else.  Four days later I was back at 5:00 sharp to ensure I got a table and not wait in the cold or do take out again!

Laab Ped Udon - the spicest and hands down favorite!  It's a good burn!
Kang Hoh - hard to stop eating! Each forkful had its own flavor nuance
Mee Kati Isan - started scooping the sauce that wasn't clinging to the noodles onto our rice so we could eat every bit of it!
Tom Som Pla Kra Pong - the red snapper tasted sweeter than usual in contrast to the other spicy dishes.  I loved the ginger and tamarind broth but others may find it a bit too sharp and spicy
Kao Tod Nam Klook - very good, but  other dishes out shined it

I've never been to Thailand but have eaten at a lot of Thai restaurant all over the city and this place is a keeper!  They have been only open a few months and I'm really hoping they maintain their high standards and never dumb down on the spices!

I've seen a lot of ugly babies in my time (some on Yelp), but this Ugly Baby bites back. If you're into authentic Thai food with a giant spicy kick, then you've come to the right place.

The Khao Soi Nuer (northern egg noodle soup) WILL make you sweat. But that's good. Get all those toxins out. Don't worry, the staff will keep your ice water cup filled. And provide you with more cutesy napkins to dab your forehead.

Portion sizes are also pretty big, so just when you think you can make it through without burning a hole in your stomach, you find a whole 'nother hunk of beef and even more noodles. Yowza.

Their beer list is also surprisingly good. A surprise to be sure, but a welcome one!

Saturday evening, was hit with a 20 minute wait for a table of two. Thankfully there are enough things to do in the area to whittle away time before heading back. After sitting down, didn't feel too cramped despite the tiny interior.

Good variety in the menu for both food and drink. Beer list is especially impressive, eventually deciding on the Lost Nation "Tossing Seeds" ($12) - an odd tasting ale that had an almost sour like flavor. For food, ordered the Tum Kanoon ($18) - a combination of pork belly, jackfruit, pork crackling, and greens. Heavy spice in the dish (which you get warned about), and full flavor in the meat. Wasn't able to taste much of/if any jackfruit; also not getting anything out of the burnt jackfruit pieces to the side, apart from a texture change.

For the price and wait, was expecting more from here. Also, a side of rice is $2 extra.

So excited to finally make it to this place! On a Monday evening I popped in at 6:30pm and got seated at 7pm.

It's pretty small inside, but very bright and colorful, which I can say the same about the food and experience. I loved it! They are famous for having very spicy food, but the waiter was really good about warning us. Since it was our first time there, we tried a few of their most popular dishes (the table next to us literally ordered the same 3 things!)

Tue Ka Ko (Coconut Milk Cakes, 5/5): so fun! Little round fried balls that are crumbly like cornmeal, fragrant from the coconut and peanuts on top, sweet chili sauce underneath. Taste one, then save the rest for intermittent relief between the spicy foods.

Khao Soi Nuer (5/5): I LOVE khao soi, and this was hitting all the right spots. Spice level is 8 out of 10 for me, but somehow the extra spice just made me eat it faster. They will warn you about the extra little scoop of chili on top - remove that and taste the dish first. You can always add it back in, but you can't take it out.

Khoong Muk Kai Kem (Shrimp, Squid, & Salted Egg Yolk, 5/5): my friend's favorite dish, and also mine! It is quite a mild spice level, and so delicious from the salty egg yolk sauce. I would love a steamed bun or extra rice to dunk into the rest of the sauce. The seafood is bouncy and fresh, cooked perfectly.

Beef Curry (3.5/5): beef ribs that are falling off the bone tender, in a drier curry with tons of lemongrass, ginger, and bay leaves? Spice level is about 7 out of 10. Personally the flavors didn't speak as much to me, I usually enjoy curries with some coconut milk or something sweet to balance the savory.

We went home directly to get some ice cream to soothe our happy stomachs. I was still feeling fiery 5 hours afterwards, so next time I'll probably go for lunch. Don't let that deter you though - this is some of the most exciting Thai food I've ever had.

This is not your average run of the mill Thai food - you won't find pad thai on the menu. I had also heard from several people that their food is seriously spicy so to go easy. The waiter there was able to recommend 5 items which worked out really well:
Tue ka ko: fried coconut milk cakes (great to start off with these, a bit like cornbread)
Khoong muk kai kem: shrimp, squid, and salted egg (the salted egg really packs a punch, and this was my favorite dish. Medium spicy)
Kang prik: super spicy spareribs with birds eye chili. Brace yourself for this one!
Kao tod nam klook: curried rice, pork skin, ginger (we had this without peanuts but, that pork skin really added some delicious flavor and texture)
Tom sum pla kra pong: red snapper in ginger and tamarind (great soothing ending to some fiery dishes)
The beers complement the spicy food also (I had the Mango mango mango sour ale)

Ugly Baby--what a name! You won't find familiar Thai dishes here like pad thai or tom yum soup, and if you ask someone to read the terribly-fonted menu, they probably wouldn't be able to recognize a thing! But the flavors here are seriously authentic and spicy without reprieve (though they do have non-spicy dishes and recommend getting a mix of dishes for balance). The place is small and loud, but colorfully painted and quirky (the napkins have drawings of cats and baby chicks), and you can see the open kitchen where all the beautifully plated dishes are assembled!

Our very friendly waiter gave us some recommendations, and we started off with the Tue Ka Ko, or fried coconut milk, taro, and black bean fritters topped with crushed peanuts, cilantro, and a sticky sweet-savory sauce. This tasty (non-spicy) appetizer had a crumbly texture and was a good way to prepare the palate for the very spicy dishes to come.. Next came the Kanom Jean Kiew Warn Gai, a dish of green curry with chicken, eggplant, basil, and red chilies, all served over rice noodles. Our waiter had warned us that this was a spicy dish, but still I was not prepared! The first bite doesn't necessarily seem overwhelming, but it just builds and builds, the pain lingering long after, and after it all settles down, you can't help but go for more! I love it!

And finally came my favorite dish of the night, the highly recommended Kao Tod Nam Klook, described as a "curried rice" with fermented pork, peanut, and ginger, and served with herbs, green beans, lettuce, and cucumber spears! Parts of the rice had a really crispy fried texture, and the flavor of the soured pork, the crunch of the peanuts, and the freshness of the vegetables all just came together!

What a meal! I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this gem of a restaurant--great service, lively atmosphere, explosive flavors, and amazing value too!

Burn, (Ugly) Baby, burn.

This place certainly lives up to its reputation of exceedingly spicy Thai dishes. We ordered the khao soi nuer (northern egg noodle curry soup with beef shank), tum kanoon (young jackfruit, pork belly, curry paste, and roselle), and tom som pla kra pong (red snapper in ginger and tamarind broth). The red snapper was by far our favorite dish, not only because it was the one mild and therefore manageable dish, but because it was genuinely delicious. The broth was lightly tart and very comforting and full of flavor, while the fish was wonderfully tender... and there was a lot of it.

The khao soi and jackfruit dishes were the same level of spiciness, and both were a bit too much for us to handle. I've tried better khao soi before. Parts of the beef were  unpleasantly tough and chewy. The sauce did have good flavor, though, and I enjoyed the pickled veggies. The jackfruit dish was fine, but not very memorable. I did like the crispiness and saltiness of the pork rinds and fried roselle leaves that came with it, and it wasn't quite as searingly spicy as the khao soi because it was a drier dish.

I'm really not sure why they can't alter the spice level of their food. It makes sense if only 10-20% of the menu boasts very spicy dishes... not 90%. The duck laab is literally listed as "stay-away spicy." There comes a point when the spice level is so high that it just ruins the enjoyment of a dish for me because that's all I can taste.

As someone who has a pretty high threshold for spice & drenches everything in it, I must say this place was absolutely amazing. It was incredibly spicy, very brutal. But walked in super excited, had an awesome sauce meal, and crawled out tearing but totally satisfied.

Do yourself a favor & grab a refreshing drink while you have your meal. The Thai Iced Tea was very refreshing! The staff was very friendly, they kept giving me cucumbers (supposed to help with the spice!) because they knew I was dying. Thank you!

Kua Kling - Southern Dry Eye Round Curry
Let's start with the spices dish shall we? This dish was very flavorful (yes, you can still taste it). But I must say after like the 7th bite I was like okay, I need rice, which made it even better! It's that dish that's too spicy, but it's so good, so you eat it anyway!

Khoong Yang Aroy Aroy - Ayuthaya's Grilled Prawns
Big fan of prawns & these definitely did not disappoint. Yes, they're spicy, but also fat & seasoned so well. If you're one of those people who's lazy to peel the shell, get over it. This one's worth it!

Pla Tod Kamin - Fried Turmeric Sea Bream
This was probably my favorite plate of my meal! The fish was cooked very nicely - soft on the inside & crispy on the outside. The spice level was okay compared to the other two so if you need a break, definitely the dish to get. Loved it!

One of the best Thai restaurant in Brooklyn. If you can handle the heat, the spiciness-go try this place out. A small store with limited seats and a small bar area so be prepared to wait. We got there early, before 6:30pm and got seated quickly. But the place got full by 7pm so plan wisely people. The waitresses were courteous and explained their dishes and recommended which dishes paired together taste good. They tell you when arrived at your table that most of their dishes are spicy. We chose the fried turmeric sea bream (a must!) and the northern egg noodle curry soup with beef shank (also a must!) This pair was recommended by the server since we really wanted the sea bream and she recommended the noodle, which is pretty spicy and blended well with the fish which wasn't.
Amazing food. These two dishes were enough for 2 people. All their dishes are shareable and everyone can try other dishes if you go with a large party. But you probably shouldnt since it is a small space. The dishes came out fast but bc we were seated near the entrance, our food got cold pretty fast since people kept coming in and out. They have a very heavy curtain to try to block the wind but it makes exiting and entering very difficult. Had a hard time moving the curtain. There is one gender neutral bathroom. Overall, will be back to try more of their dishes!

I'd heard rave reviews about Ugly Baby ever since it opened, but hadn't had the chance to go due to its popularity and location. Finally got the chance to drop in on a weekday evening during the holiday season. Even though we walked in approximately 3 minutes after the restaurant opened, there were already several tables taken, so this place is clearly still very popular.

Of course the one thing that everyone knows about this place is the unforgiving spice in the dishes - no substitutions or replacements, thanks. Ugly Baby definitely lived up to all those rumors.

We ordered the coconut milk cakes, khao soi, and kao ta nam kloot. Thought we had it easy with the coconut milk cakes, but the waiter laughed when he saw us struggling through the kao ta nam kloot (supposedly a mild dish), and warned us that our final dish would be really spicy. We should've known better than to defy his warning, and had to give up on the khao soi after just a few (delicious) bites. The waiter helpfully brought us some cucumber slices to cool down our mouths, but it was too late for us. Despite our failure, Ugly Baby was a success and we loved every bit of food that we could stuff down.

Highly recommend - come early to get a seat, and order a side of Thai iced tea to cool down that heat.

Restaurant Overview - While the eclectic, hipster-painted walls make this little Brooklyn-based Thai restaurant feel welcoming when you walk past the colorful draperies, do not let your guard down - your taste buds are in for an arduous (and spicy) journey.

The Service - Arrived around 5:45 PM on a Saturday night and left my phone number with the hostess while I waited 45 min with a nice cocktail at Brooklyn Social just two blocks up the road. Be sure to arrive early if dining with a mid-sized party (i.e. 5+ people), especially on the weekends as the wait can be stretched deeper into the night.

Once seated, our waiter was extremely friendly and provided us with a well thought out, 3-course dining plan for the evening: one non-spicy dish, one mildly spicy dish, and one extremely hot dish. In addition, he maintained our supply of cucumbers which is crucial for getting through this dining experience.

The Food - Started out with the Tue Ka Ko which consists of sticky and sweet fried coconut milk cakes with black bean and taro. Garnished with crumbled peanuts, this dish served as a flavorful appetizer.

Up next was the Kao Tod Nam Klook, a cold yet mildly spicy salad dish that served as the perfect "heat step up" from the Tue Ka Ko. Consisting of curried rice, pork skin, peanut & ginger, this dish is best eaten like a lettuce wrap.

Finally, the main event: Kang Hoh. This dish is not for the spicy-weak. Made up of pork shoulder, spare ribs & noodles coated with Hung Le, a Northern Thai curry, the Kang Hoh offers a wonderful aroma of spices that kicks your taste buds with tastiness and heat.

TL;DR  - A fantastic, authentic Thai experience tucked away in Carroll Gardens that will strain yet please even the most experienced spicy-eaters.

For years, I was under the impression that Queens was the boss when it came to Thai food. My go to joints were SriPra Phai, Zabb Elee (now closed) to name a few. I never thought of Thai food in Brooklyn as a thing.

Then one day, I asked about Ugly Baby in Carroll Gardens. I had seen the place while passing by several times and decided one night it was worth investigation. Boy was it a worthy visit. Queens move over, Brooklyn has hit the jackpot with Ugly Baby. Now, to be forthcoming, this place is not for everyone and I mean the food. As one could discern from some of the other reviews, if Spicy is not your thing, then this mother of all Thai houses is not your home. Leave it to folks like myself.

The food is exceptionally good. Scrumptious and the best part. Spicy AF! This is not your "Americanized" Thai food. This is legit, the real deal and as someone who has visited Thailand, the food here is spicier than many places there. Alas, some of those places in Thailand have fallen victim to the tourist demands of fried and non spicy...UGH!

But I digress. Ugly Baby is small. A tight squeeze for dining but cozy enough. The wait can be tough for those of you accustomed to short waits. On busy days, especially Friday nights it could be up to an hour.  Be prepared for 30-45 mins wait. I recommend getting there early. That way you get a shot at all the dishes before they run out of some items. You don't want to miss Pla Tod Kamin which is a a sea bream in fried Tumeric or the Pork Ribs with Fresh Bird Eye Chilis (spicy and delicious) or the brutally spicy Kua Kling.

The service is solid and the staff quite nice but don't expect the service to be at your beck and call. They are busy, busy, busy. I always like to get a spot where I could watch the magic in the kitchen and where sometimes I get to raise a glass in toast to a job well done. Thanks to all off you at Ugly Baby for making some of the best Thai Food around. I have now tasted pretty much everything on your menu. Please don't ever change

I've been hankering for a meal here since they opened nearly two years ago. In that time I must've built up Ugly Baby to be a bastion of authentic flavors, a haven for spice lovers, a place where they warn you the food is gonna make you sweat, and they mean it. And sure, the food was pretty spicy. But tasty? I'm second guessing some of that now.

A part of me feels like maybe my group ordered the wrong dishes. But considering we ordered 5 items off the menu, that's enough of a menu sampling to make a determination about their kitchen, right?

The sea bream was highly recommended by our server, as were the coconut cakes. We took his word and were a bit underwhelmed. The sea bream was a whole fish that had been deep fried so much that most of the edges were burnt, and the fish itself didn't have a lot of meat on it. A lot of bones, though.

The coconut cakes came in a nice sweet sauce and were crispy on the edges. This is definitely a good dish for vegetarians, as it's one of the few veggie friendly items on the menu, but it's nothing special.

The most flavorful dish we ordered was the khao soi. Lots of texture in this dish from the crunchy noodles, noodles and cilantro. And the soup was very delicious, and in my opinion the right amount of spicy.

We ordered the pork belly salad and green curry dishes as well, but much of the dishes were left untouched, which says something to me. I think these dishes were lacking a wow factor, I very much felt that I could've ordered these dishes from my local Thai spot.

I'd totally give it another try to taste their other dishes.

Ugly Baby is a Thai restaurant that is unapologetic about their spice levels as well as their cake service fee of $25. With that said, I will probably not be back. Their spice level is too much, even for me.

I can't stress enough that this is a spicy restaurant. If you love spice, then this is the restaurant for you. Bonus points if you have wanderlust for Thailand or miss Thailand. This is 100% legit Thai spice. I needed two cups of Thai Iced Tea to regain my sight back and calm down my mouth which was on fire. Other people had sweat pouring out of their heads and runny noses. You have been warned!

With that said, the staff is really great and patient to walk you through the menu which does not include any typical Thai dishes like pad thai or thai basil fried rice. The food at Ugly Baby are complex dishes which use all sorts of Thai spices and special chilis. We picked the most tame items hoping to be edible for our palates.

For seven people we ordered:

Pla Tod Kamin (fried tumeric sea bream) NOT SPICY
Kao Tod Nam Kloot (curried rice) NOT SPICY
Kang Hoh (Northern dry hung le + red curry paste w/ pork shoulder, spare ribs, mung bean noodles) SPICY
Curried Shrimp SPICY
Kanom Jean Kiew Warn (vermicelli, chicken, spicy green curry, bird eye chilis) SPICY
Khoa Soi Nuer (egg noodle, curry soup, beef shank) VERY SPICY

Please note that SPICY is really very spicy and VERY SPICY is extremely spicy. I don't think my words even convey how spicy the food is here. You just have to taste is for yourself. And all you will taste is spice.

Good luck!

So much flavor, yet so much BURN!

Our waitress did her due diligence in thoroughly warning us how spicy the majority of dishes, particularly all the curries, come.
Her guidance was necessary because the menu won't give you many clues. Cause this place is just that authentic: no basic pad thai nor picture guides in sight. Just straight up original dish names and some lists of ingredients that would still stump a neophyte.

We went with the one of the waitress's recommendations of medium dishes to try--the curried rice--and then ventured on our own cause me and my dining mate are comfortable eating spicy. So, we just HAD to test the limits. We also ordered the fried coconut dough balls and the green curry with chicken and rice vermicelli.

All dishes are made to be shared. It would seem like a lot of the craft beers are too given their size and prices! I'll have to return and investigate that further some other time. This go around I settled with a sour from upstate, which was a solid choice.

Our food came out rather swiftly and we went straight into the curried rice. SO MUCH FLAVOR. In fact, it was a little too citrus forward for me at first. And, it was legit on the medium-hot end of spiciness. It was super yummy, but definitely full of kick. Made me ripe with nervousness at just how much spicier the curry could possibly be...

SO. MUCH. SPICIER! Yes, the curry was rich, the chicken tender, the noodles slurp-slurpy. But eating this dish was exactly how videos of habanero or ghost pepper challenges go: you're fine for the first 15-30 seconds, and then the burn sets in. By the time I finished 5 bites, my mouth was on fire--tongue burning, saliva pooling, eyes watering. After that, the curried rice level of spice tasted below mild, and we gobbled it up desperate to swallow away the remainder of the curry burn.

We should've order a ton of rice on the side and milk drinks like I noticed other tables did. Though I'll admit, glancing around, few people seemed to have ordered our dish. It quite possibly be the hottest curry on the menu for all I know. But besides the small setback of that dish being inedible for us, I really enjoyed the explosions of delicious flavors and bursts of color throughout the restaurant's decor. While not cooling enough for me on a hot summer day, I see myself a regular adventure once autumn hits.

Ain't nothing ugly about this baby. This is JonBenet Ramsey right here (minus the tragic death). Worth the trek to Brooklyn for real Thai food with real Thai flavors--none of that watered down, Americanized crap so prevalent in Manhattan.

Try the Tum Kanoon to see jackfruit done right, the Laab Ped Udon for real duck salad, and the Pad Tua Ngok Rau Kao if you need some fiber with your protein. Only complaint I had was that the spicy dishes were nowhere near as spicy as I would've liked. I guess for that, I'll still need to go back to Somtum Der (ironically, in Manhattan).

- Superstar A+ service
- Waitress had great suggestions
- I like the, you get what you get attitude. No replacements of items on the menu to make it less spicy
- This is not your traditional Thai (no pad Thai or drunken noodles here)
- The sauce on the coconut cakes is worth the price alone
- loved the fried fish (its not spicy)
- The beef shank is good, but spicy (I liked to try it, but I wouldn't order it)
- Went on a Tuesday at 8pm, and there was one table left
- Cool soundtrack
- Tasty wine

"According to the surgeon general, if you eat this food while pregnant, your baby will be ugly." *

* The surgeon general may or may not have actually said this, just my friends, but I've never been pregnant and eaten here so I can neither confirm nor deny. But if you want to test this theory- and/or cry tears of pain/joy- I highly recommend a trip to Ugly Baby.

This is not a place you go for pad thai or similar basic dishes. This is also not a place you bring those who can't handle spice (me) without prior warning. But if you're looking to try seriously cool and creative Thai dishes (and maybe cry a little), Ugly Baby is a good place to start.

Everything is spicy - literally everything. But in return for a little pain, you'll be rewarded with a variety of funky sweet, sour, umami, and salty notes that you rarely taste all in one dish. I highly recommend gathering a group of your bravest friends and sharing in the pain together.

The little coconut and corn muffins were an excellent starter. The fried whole fish was both crispy and succulent. Their khao soi was an excellent and hearty dish, with plenty of curry broth, beef, and crispy noodles. I actually found this dish spicier than their infamous green curry, which apparently was the spiciest dish on the menu. At this point in the meal, I may have been hallucinating and/or numb from the spice, so it was hard to tell.

The staff is more than happy to give recommendations, and will liberally warn you if they think your weak American tastebuds aren't up to the challenge. You should definitely listen to them, but also not be afraid to get outside of your comfort zone, because you will be rewarded with so many delicious flavors.

Anyways, eat here. Just be prepared to set your mouth on fire (and potentially ruin the aesthetics of your future children- a worthy risk, if you ask me).

Was really excited about visiting this spot after hearing all the hype about it from locals and social media. We got there at 11:55am on a Sunday (5 min before they opened) to make sure that we could get in without a long wait. There were a couple parties waiting outside already, but we were able to get seated right away when the clock turned 12.

We braced ourselves for the spice, ordering: Kao Tod Nam Klook (mild/medium), Kang Hoh (medium), and Laab Ped Udon (one of the spiciest dishes). While they were spicy, nothing was unbearable. However, it would have been nice to receive rice as a side. We only received a small portion of sticky rice with one of the dishes.

Our favorite was definitely the Kang Hoh. The glass noodles and pork shoulder were superb. We split the three dishes among three people, and honestly at the end we couldn't tell if we were full (the portions are kind of on the smaller end) or if we were just full of heat from the spice.

Everything on the menu is really interesting, and you won't see Pad Thai or Pad See Ew like you do at other Thai restaurants. It's definitely a place to check out if you are a bit on the adventurous side.

Stepping back in here to update my previous review. The first time I had Ugly Baby I was mostly embittered by the fact that the pickup time quoted was really off. Fast forward almost a year and Ugly Baby is definitively my favorite Thai place in the city.

After now having tried most things on the menu I can say that the Kang Ho and Khao Soi (especially the latter) are my favorites. The Kua Kling is amazing but BEWARE: it is the spiciest thing I have ever eaten before in my life. This place is no joke and makes the spiciness at Boons and Som Tum Der look like absolutely childs' play. Make sure to have a tall glass of milk next to you at all times while eating.

Service is continually great. Had a wonderful birthday there this past year.

Super mixed feelings about this spot. On one hand, the food is solid. However, I was hoping it would stack up with the likes of Uncle Boons (my favorite Thai in the city but frequently inaccessible thanks to some serious hype, and consequently minimum 2 hour waits at peak times), and it just didn't.

I ordered the Kang Ho, which contains pork shoulder, spare ribs, and mungbean noodles. At $17, it's considerably cheaper than any of the entrees on Uncle Boons' menu. The portion size was solid - I was totally satiated after eating without being uncomfortably stuffed. I was hoping it would be a little spicier than it was - I found the dish to be relatively mild (maybe 4/10 spice-wise), although at one point I did bite into an angry-looking red pepper that set my mouth ablaze and had me feeling some type of way for the rest of the night.

I had ordered take-out, but went into the restaurant to pick it up. It's tight on the inside, possibly a little smaller than I would like, and there isn't much seating. It has a fairly casual vibe and lends itself better to a dinner with a close friend than a date spot. I do believe it's still BYOB, though, which is a total game-changer. Not sure if there's a corkage fee, but I can absolutely get behind not racking up a $100+ bill on booze alone.

Would have been 4 stars except for a frustrating experience with delivery. I live about 30 mins from Ugly Baby (it's my boyfriend's neighbor, however) and I called right before I left my apartment to place the order and was quoted 45 minutes, which was perfect. However, less than 15 minutes later I get a call saying my food is ready. I suppose I appreciate the promptness, but this meant that it was sitting out and getting cold.

TL;DR: Would return but the fact that it's BYOB has a lot to do with that. Anywhere else but NYC Ugly Baby would really hold its own, but with so many great Thai choices around it barely makes a blip on the radar.

Ok, first...the name is HILARIOUS. We've all seen them and yet no one acknowledges that there are such things. But I digress. The entire menu is spicy so if you are not looking for spice, this is not the place for you. But if you are looking for flavor filled yummy food. This is a great place. It is also small. If you want a table here. Optimal times are an hour before closing or at the start of the round.

Worth the 6 hour flight, 1 hour subway, and 20 minute walk in freezing winds. The best Thai food I've had, inside or outside of Thailand. They're not joking about the spice- take your server's advice seriously! Ask for sticky rice on the side. To round out the meal, you must get the Thai tea to soothe your burning tongue.

This was really outstanding, and just as spicy as everyone says it is.

First visit, we got the tue ka ko (small coconut cakes), kang kua supparod (mushroom pineapple curry), khoong muk kai kem (a mix of shrimp and squid), and kanom jean kiew warn gai (vermicelli noodles in a green curry sauce). I would have a hard time not ordering any of the first three next time -- all of them were incredible. The shrimp and squid dish had a pretty perfect spice level for me (probably a bit too hot for my wife, but she still really enjoyed it). The mushroom pineapple curry was one of my favorite Thai dishes I've ever eaten -- the sauce alone was so good, I downed the entire bowl. The green curry was our least favorite, and also the spiciest -- I'm not sure that it was actually the spice level that put it below the others, but we probably wouldn't get it again.

Can't wait to come back and try more stuff -- this would be a great spot to come with a group of more than two so that we can share more. (That duck salad is supposed to be incredibly spicy and I'd love to get that next time around.)

Ugly Baby is, without a doubt, the best Thai restaurant I've yet experienced in this city--or really, anywhere. I'm no expert, but to the best degree I can tell, it's got "real" authentic Thai food. No pad thais or standard green/red curries here; instead, you'll find an incredible array of new and exciting dishes, ALL of which look equally appealing.

We went with the Khao Sui Nuer and Shrimp, Squid, and Egg Yolk, which was plenty for the two of us. The Khao Sui Nuer comes with a fiery curry sauce on the side that you can titrate in to your liking, but be careful--it's really, really good *and* really, really potent. The shrimp and squid dish is a little milder, but equally fantastic. It's not as spicy, but very flavorful with coconut- and tamarind-ish notes. I'd highly recommend both.

If anything, our only regret here was not having a larger group to share (and try) more dishes. That being said, it's a small-ish space, so I wouldn't plan for more than 4, maybe max. 6.

A few other notes. First, the staff here are excellent. There's a lot to work with on the menu, and they were great with helping us find something well suited to our preferences. Second, the place is simple and has a sort of hole-in-the-wall charm, but the quirky, rainbow decor adds to the fun of the whole experience. And finally, this is one of the best "value-for-quality" deals in the city. Most entrees are in the $15-20 range, with generous, very much splittable portions.

In short: Ugly Baby is freaking great. Go ASAP.

Unfathomably spicy. Unreasonably spicy. So spicy I am seriously advising you to not go because it's too spicy.
Seriously, we were advised against getting the duck noodle because it is "10 out of 10 spicy" so instead got the (beef shank) khao soi which was "medium spicy" and the pork rind salad. Nope! Khao soi was so uncomfortably spicy that we just gave up and boxed it up to dilute threefold with more noodles or rice later. It might have been still tasty in the meanwhile but we were too busy crying and wiping the waterfall of sweat off our brows to really tell.
The fried pork skin salad was nice though. Still spicy, but the pork rind, peanuts, fried rice (like actual crunchy chunks), romaine, and cucumber pair with the 11/10 extra-loud mint-cilantro-lime-fish sauce flavors well.
I will give them credit for sticking to their guns and their reputation. The servers are very kind and open about their menu and advise you appropriately, but apparently both the kitchen and service really stick to their guns about not turning down their spice level. Why??

Well don't go here if you can't handle spice. I'm pretty good with spicy food and even I needed a little water break whilst digging in to my kao sa. It was delicious the meat was tender and the flavors were balanced despite the spice. We also got the fried sea bream...to me this fish was not spicy and it balanced out the other one. All in all a great experience except that the bar seating isn't very steady or comfortable.

I'm going to start the review of this really outstanding restaurant with a tip:
Order your "Family Style" meal no more than two dishes at a time! We ordered all six dishes when the waiter asked us what we wanted and us three souls sitting at a 3ft. X 3ft. table were inundated with plates, serving spoons, dipping sauces and any other things they could throw at us. I actually started eating with an order of *Sia Tod (pork intestines) sitting on lap; our table was THAT crowded!
But, with that being my only gripe at this restaurant, our Thai dinner here was not only one of the most original Thai dinners I've ever had, it was in the top 3 (out of Hundreds) in terms of taste and heat and presentation.

So besides the pig intestines sitting on my lap we had:
*Kang Prik - spare ribs in a bird's eye chili curry that was really good
*Khoong Muk Kaikem - squid and shrimp with a salted egg that just knocked me out. I would come back just for an order of this and a beer
*Lab Ped Udon - which was a rich and deep Udon with shredded duck meat in a deconstructed salad......simply divine / very different
*Pla Tod Kamin - this was a fried whole Sea Bream just dosed with turmeric spice. Sublime!
Tue Ka Ko - these delicious fried coconut milk cakes with black beans and taro rounded out this damn perfect dinner.

This place is small and gets VERY crowded so expect some wait time. The staff is friendly and accommodating in every respect and this dinner is not inexpensive, but with what your getting and the originality of this food makes it well worth the price of admission.

We don't know if it was the freezing situation at the tables near the door or the spiciness of the dishes but we were quite disappointed with our dinner here.

After reading so many positive reviews, we've decided it's about time to trek to 4th street on a cold winter night to try Ugly Baby. Compared to our first attempt, this time it didn't take us long to be seated, but near the door.

We found the tables so close to each other that private/intimate conversation is not expected here. Our waiter however was genuinely helpful and she discussed with us the spicy levels of each of the dishes.

We started with a bottle of IPA beer and ordered the fried sea bream, pigs tongue and pork belly with shrimp paste, it was served in timely fashion although it gotten really cold as soon as they put it on our table. In fact it was so cold we could not even remove our jackets and beanies because of the temperature, my lower body was freezing, it was that bad!

I hope that the management would read this and do something with the door situation specially in winter time, as I said we didn't enjoy our dinner this time but will keep an open mind to come back in warmer weather.

Went for a late lunch on a weekend to avoid the long wait. Was seated in about 25 minutes.

In short: Ugly Baby is fine, but a bit overhyped. People make the mistake of calling the food here super-authentic just because it's spicier than they're used to. And while there are some dishes here that you'd be hard pressed to find on other menus in the city, there were some liberties taken: for example, for all the time I lived in Thailand, I never saw a green curry served over rice vermicelli.

The food is good and pretty spicy, but it's not going to kill you. Just step up and try it. The overall heat level is still not as aggressive as you'd see in Thailand, so it is toned down somewhat for western palates. Ped samrap farang :)

I was disappointed when they were out of some of my top choices on the menu. They were fresh out of Khao Soi when I went for a late lunch. They were also out of a beef dish (I forget which), so I settled on my third choice, the green chicken curry on rice vermicelli. It was fine, but not spectacular. They might have taken the spice too far on the green curry, too: there was enough chili in there that the curry was red, not a more typical (and authentic) milky green. Don't get me wrong, I'm a card-carrying spice junkie, but green curry isn't usually spiced that aggressively. I couldn't help but think that the heat was being used as a gimmick here.

The service is also interesting. The staff were great; nothing wrong with them. My dish came out first, then my wife's fish dish arrived quite a bit later. My curry was lukewarm by the time her main course came out. I know Thai food is often served family style, but when they serve such polarizing food (too spicy for many), they should expect that some folks there will be ordering individual dishes, not family style. Perhaps clarify with customers up front whether the dishes should be brought out together, or as they are ready?

All in all this was tasty food and I appreciate that they dial up the heat a bit compared to some other Thai restaurants. I just can't justify waiting for more than an hour for a meal here, as many seem to do.

This is the spicy Thai food, not the typical pad Thai or drunken noodle type of Thai food. The restaurant focuses on Northern Thai food. We ordered:
- Mushroom pineapple curry
- Mixed seafood
We were both crying while eating but it was so tasty!

Hands down THE BEST Thai food in NYC. No joke! Ive see their name on several food articles and foodies reviews everywhere. I can see why everyone is talking about this place. The portion is generous. Bring friends so you try variety of dishes on the menu.
