Came here with a friend around 9:30/10pm on a Saturday night post re-opening during the pandemic. Wait staff was nice and gave great recommendations for both drinks + food. He suggested the crab roll over the lobster roll, and it just hit the spot! The drink was also very suitable for my friend's palette. Very nice time overall!

A kind tip (not related to service) is to bring bug spray if you happen to sit near the plants after the rain after dark because I got bit by mosquitoes a few times.

So the food and drinks were great. Lovely to sit outside. The heat lamp was perfect.  We occasionally had a lovely female server who was so kind but the other two men were far too uptight to allow their guests to enjoy their experience.

We abide, respect and understand the mask situation. We were told we only had 1.5 hours at the table, while having a reservation. So we felt rushed right from the start. Time passed and we were able to stay later which was nice also no one else had arrived needing a table. We told the waiter to let us know when they would be needing the table back. Mind you we racked up a pretty nice sized bill. Suddenly Instead of just dropping the check for us they just sharked around our table asking when we were ready and on my way to the rest room, the perfunctory host with the red sweat shirt asked me if we were wrapping up soon. I told him I believe someone asked for the check. At any time they could have dropped the check and instead chose to keep asking when we were done. Again we were spending money supporting their business not just sitting there with one drink all night.

When customers are at your establishment to support your business, all one can ask is that you don't be a dick to your nice customers. It's very simple. Personality goes a long way in the food industry. No one likes to be served with smug attitudes. Kills the experience for the customer and makes your food taste bad.

I really wanted to like this place. The outside was super cute and I love the idea of having seafood around the area! Unfortunately, this was a major disappointment and the only thing I would suggest getting here are their cocktails (but it's so expensive).

Overall, everything is way too overpriced for what it is and it didn't taste amazing. I also came here for brunch and I really wish they had a brunch menu instead of just a set menu that's for brunch and dinner. And everything on the menu was basically just super overpriced and not special tapas (sorry :( but that's literally how I feel).

I made a reservation at 2 pm (the time they open) and I we actually the first customer to walk in. I get seated but my chair has crumbs.. I kid you not, they did not do a good job cleaning. There were crumbs that were obviously either from last night or the staff's breakfast, just on the chair.. uh.. not super amazed. The hostess was nice and apologized since she saw me wiping the crumbs off of the chair.

I ordered drinks and food with my friends and errr everything is so overpriced and not that yummy. The shrimp cocktail itself was $12 and it came with 6 shrimps and they weren't good... then there was maybe 3-4 strands of asparagus for $13 (wow...) and the steak tartare for $18 that was not delicious (yikes sorry). The deviled eggs were whatever because.. they're eggs, if this was also awful, I'd be extremely upset.

I am only giving this review a 2 stars because of the cocktails. I honestly want to give it one star but I think the drinks were pretty good overall. I still don't think the cocktails are worth what it is and I also have to say that their happy hour menu is not really happy hour... $1 off of beer and wine. That's, wow. Not even your cocktails and just $1 off? Not enticing at all. Would not come back and would not recommend ever again unfortunately. And that actually brings me to 1 star just thinking about this happy hour rule and how overpriced everything is for what it is.

Oyster and cocktails!!! Would love to live in this neighborhood and make this my "spot" the cocktails are very inventive and offer something for every mood. But the raw bar is why we showed up and it was delicious.
With the oysters came a variety of "flavor enhancers" (taco, pina colada, carrot, shallot, etc) that came in eye droppers. Something new to try, but for me it masked the flavor of the oyster. I went classic and if adding one it was lemon or shallot.
Only draw back, a little noisy to have a smooth conversation friends across the table and wish they had the windows open. But this wouldn't stop me from coming back....just how I was feeling that night :) (no worries they had a cocktail for it haha).

Rustic yet modern interior with intentional, vintage-looking chairs, small tables, wooden bar. Random books and tchotchkes on the high shelves of the wall. That enjoyably intentional rustic, cabin look. Well lit, good space yet very inviting. Friendly, punked out waitress dressed completely opposite of the vibe, cuisine, which was a fun contrast.

Pretty inventive menu for a seafood menu, though not particularly large. And far from cheap, which is the biggest deterrent.

Their oysters are delicious, fresh. And they have a $1 happy hour, which would be a steal.

The charcuterie was creative; shrimp sausage was different )but didn't quite give shrimp vibes), always a fan of lox and dill, smoked trout rillette was yum, and scallop pancetta was yum.

The Roasted Prawns & Grits will put you at $25, but it was very heart, flavorful, and full of fish.

Really solid cocktails, very unique. All around great meal.

Nice, chill spot to hang out for drinks. We came for an early Saturday dinner at 5:30 and there were a few people sprinkled at the bar but plenty of tables open. We had our 10 month old son with us so we pulled the stroller right up to the table without having to fold it up. We had:

- Bread appetizer: good, big piece of warm sour dough-like bread. Accompanied by seaweed butter and some type of lobster butter
- Dozen mixed oysters: really fresh. Came with a bunch of droppers with interesting flavors (carrot, taco, coconut, ube melon) in lieu of your typical lemon. They all went surprisingly well with the oysters
- Deviled eggs: good, though on the saltier side
- Gem salad: refreshing, with fresh fruit mixed in
- Cavatelli: good, but really salty after you mixed in the cheese
- Skate fish: good, well cooked and not fishy at all

Overall the food was decent. The customer service was excellent. Maybe because we were the only customers eating but we had a bunch of requests through out the meal and they were more than accommodating. If we had a craving for oysters this would be our spot.

This is an awesome cocktail bar. The vibe is great, it's just as good for a drink at 2pm on a Saturday as it is 1am on a Thursday. Drinks are always on point; get a little experimental with the amaro and have a good time.

The food is fine but you should probably just buy another drink instead.

Grand Army would be the perfect location for a go-to restaurant/bar for me, as I live a mere two blocks away. Unfortunately I cannot justify coming here often, as there is a lack of bang relative to the amount of bucks one has to drop during an ordinary outing here.

Pro: the charcuterie board is delicious.  Consisting of four unique items such as octopus terrine, trout rillette, and others, the flavors are excellent and nicely contrast one another.

Con: above-mentioned board, while only an appetizer, is nearly $30 and really leaves you craving more food for that dollar mark.

Pro: dollar oysters at happy hour, woo! One night the oysters were even Wellfleets, which are reliable.

Con: the most recent time I had said oysters, they tasted fishy and quite slimy. Yuck.

Pro: lovely decor and overall cool space, on a beautiful street. I do love when my girlfriend and I can snag a seat at the front window when it's light out.

Con: the place gets absolutely jammed to the point where I simply wouldn't dare test my anxiety levels by walking in. Also, being on State St results in elevated price points across the menu.

So overall I have mixed feelings about Grand Army. There are parts of it that I love (the bread and butter appetizer is actually outstanding), but certain aspects keep me walking past far more often than not.

I've been twice and I really enjoy the intimate atmosphere. It's a beautiful little gem and has delicious drinks, though the cocktails are pricey. They're made very well though. I know they also have an oyster happy hour which is a bonus for a lot of people (but not me). Good service, clean spot, will go back.

I'd prefer not to sit on backless bar stools but that's how they get you in and out quicker. And if that's my only complaint then they're doing fine!

Thought this was a very cool cocktail bar. Have not tried the food yet, but expect to next time I'm back. Their drink selection is fun. I particularly liked the monster truck theme and has to snap a picture to send to my brother. Drinks were prepared well, service was good and ambiance was charming.

The wait can be a bit much if you're only getting a drink and snack at the bar, but if you want great $1 happy hour oysters, this is the place to go.

Grab a glass of wine and a couple oysters. But most importantly, try their deviled eggs that get topped with fresh crab, you won't be sorry and your taste buds will thank you!!

I have been to Grand Army a couple of times now, which is no surprise considering I live a block away. The decor is very hipster chic and easy on the eyes, with fun posters and random collections of trinkets occupying various corners. The staff is friendly and attentive. Food menu is not very long, but changes periodically. The cocktails and oysters are the real stars here.

Daily Happy Hour is all about the $1 oysters - one type of oyster will be marked down from about $3.50 to $1, which obviously is a much better deal. I love the unique flavor infusions that come with the oysters, like taco and smoked cucumber. The drink deals during the happy hour are really nothing to write home about - just $1 off all glasses of wine and draft beers.

Truth be told, the food prices are a bit high for the tiny portion size. However, I do feel like the quality is there, which leaves me feeling slightly better when signing the check. The seafood charcuterie board is a favorite of mine, mostly for the smoked trout spread (which I swore to my boyfriend I would attempt to replicate at home) and the shrimp sausage.

There's no doubt in my mind that I am on my way to becoming a Grand Army regular. Can't wait to see this place in the winter with their cozy little fireplace going.

Seems like this tries to be a neighborhood spot but with big city menu and prices. With a mainly seafood menu and an intensive cocktail list, it's easy to over order. Unfortunately while many of the items were delicious, the small portion sizes made it an unsatisfying dinner
Most of the "entrees" were over $25 and seemed more like tapas. I still want to come back the happy hour specials like dollar oysters at the raw bar but maybe not for dinner again ⁣⁣

Bar looked great and loved the quaint atmosphere! Food was ok and so was service.  Will not be returning due to the very snooty attitude if the host.  The host passively aggressively was not allowing me to use the rest room by rudely letting people cut and by telling me directly he is letting them cut me.  In addition these individuals were not required to sign a book and give personal information as I was asked to do.  These policies are highly discriminatory and unacceptable.  Why should some patrons be allowed to freely use the restrooms and other patrons be forced to sign a book and provide personal information.

Went here expecting to eat dinner and turned out to be more light apps and cocktails than I thought. The menu online did not match menu at restaraunt. I hate when that happens because I plan what I want to eat, and then my plans are all messed up!

The food is good don't get me wrong but its just not a satisifying dinner. We had the bread and butter which was amazing, great tasting bread and the seasoned butters it came with had great flavor as well. Then we had the seafood charcuterie. All seafood no meat like the name, but they smoked the compilation of fishes to taste like meat and even put shrimp in a casing like sausage. Very good again, but not filling at all and expensive. We ordered the goat cheese brulee which took the longest to come out for some reason, and was legit just a huge wedge of goat cheese carmelized on top. Tasted very good though but way too much cheese since they only gave us 2 bread crisps to eat it with. We had to ask for more bread. So mostly our dinner consisted of bread.

Saw a lot of people ordering oysters and they do have a happy hour where the ones from Virginia are 1 dollar a piece. We are not oyster eaters though. We wanted to try something we saw on thier online menu that's why we went there and then they didn't have it...

Cocktails are every good. A lot are very smokey.

Really cute environment too, very nice and relaxing. They play heavy metal music which is an interesting juxtaposition to their light menu and pretty decor.

Never been to Grand Army but friend suggested we meet there. Grabbed some seats at the bar and waited more than ten minutes to get a menu. Waited even longer to order drinks and oysters. The oysters came with some wack sauce-Melon!!!! and Taco!!!! and silly eye droppers  I asked if they had just the classic mignonette but they said no so I asked for Tabasco they didn't have that either. If you're going to serve oysters, you got to at least have Tabasco. I wanted to order more drinks to cleanse my taste of the oysters but bartender never came over to ask if we wanted another drink. Finally had to ask a waiter for the check

One star for proximity
The other star for available seats at the bar

I have been here for both brunch and happy hour. Think this spot is more worthit for happy hour special ($1 oysters) & nice cocktail service. Added plus, on a blistering cold winter night they had their fireplace going. Love the ambiance albeit it can get loud.

We stumbled upon this place walking around the neighborhood, and wow, we were so sorry we had not discovered it sooner. It has a relaxed and chic feel to it, we sat comfortably at the bar and enjoyed great conversation with the staff.

But it was the drinks that were the winners, they were crafted with care and the staff really offered unique selections. We asked for a gin drink, and the bartender made us a creation he had recently came up with. It. Was. Stellar.

Additionally, the food was amazing - surprisingly good seafood and oysters. This place is worth the time out of your day - stop reading this review and head on over there!

Pretty good atmosphere, crowded but cozy and intimate setting. Good place for a date, but expect smallish portions and highish prices.

I shared a dozen oysters, my favorite part were the different sauces which come in little droplet vials which allows for great precision when applying to your oysters.

Also shared the "seafood charcuterie." which was alright. the best thing in there by far was the smoked trout dip. Other items has somewhat strange texture. Small portions.

Overall, good intimate setting. Somewhat pricey and small portions.

If I lived in the neighborhood, this would 1000% be my go-to spot. Happy hour oysters + good cocktails + extensive menu for brunch AND dinner + cute atmosphere means this place checks all the boxes. It even has a fireplace in the winter to create some cozy vibes that are a must for me this time of year.

This place is known for its oysters that come with a set of droppers with unique sauces to put on top. Honestly I am a fan of just keeping it simple and sticking with lemon but I totally appreciate the appeal and thought it was really fun!

For food, I have had the mussels twice and they are my absolute favorite. They are always really big and juicy mussels and come in this fantastic spicy coconut sauce. It was a really big portion as well so I recommend you share.

The cocktails are also phenomenal. They offer a daily "bosses cabinet" for $12 which has never let me down. Most recently it was a mezcal negroni, combing two of my favorite things into one - #blessed.

Everything one can possibly loathe about Brooklyn in one grossly pretentious hipster self hatred den.

1. I asked for a men's room and was sarcastically told that the UNISEX bathroom was in front of me
2. Place famous for oysters but OUT of not one ...not two...but THREE out of six oyster selections.
3. We eat oysters with saltines...we bring our own to all restaurants on this planet and have never heard an I'll word..from a single restaurant...ever!  at this pretentious shit hole...we were told that the oysters don't come served with crackers and to put them away..and were literally not allowed to eat their fishy oysters the way we enjoy them.
4. No horseradish or cocktail or Tabasco ...only "tinctures" hahaha wow ...pretentious much!?!? Carrot "tincture" for an oyster !!? For real? Can you over complicate things more ?

All this plus dumb insanely loud music ...ants (YES ANTS) ...and awful pretentiously complex and overly sweet cocktails makes this place a keep-away-from ...by anyone with self awareness outside the ages of 28-35.

Never come back ...

We had a small group at the bar area. The drinks and food are overpriced. The plate of pasta was drenched with sauce and it was so small for $20. The waitresses were just downright rude. Meanwhile, they put gratuity on the check and they were just nasty.
I would NOT go back.
I would get better service and food at an Irish grub place.

I was excited to see Grand Army open for takeout as we survive through this pandemic.  I was especially excited to see lobster and other rolls on the menu. I figured I would get what I've come to expect at Grand Army: quality food at a reasonable price. I was disappointed. They were offering 3 rolls: lobster (of which they were out but its a pandemic so understandable), crab and shrimp.  My gf and i decided on the crab.
We also ordered a side of ceviche-i asked for the small. Starting with the rolls: Unlike other seafood rolls i've gotten at good roll spots in the vicinity, these rolls were teeny tiny. I think i ate my roll in 2 bites and was still starved.  I was charged for a large ceviche despite asking for the small (but hey its only $2 difference so whatever)-at least i think it was large as that was gone in about 2 bites as well. And we got 2 drinks which I can say were good.  So basically, for about $80 with tip, we had a tiny meal and went for a pizza after.  Sorry, i love you guys at Grand Army, i understand its a pandemic and restaurants are facing tough times and need to make more money on the food, but charging that much is ridiculous.  I'm confident they'll get it together and be back to their old selves maybe once we can all eat in restaurants again (if that ever happens ugh), but in the mean time, if you're willing to walk a bit, there are more affordable spots for excellent seafood rolls.

I live about a 5 min walk away and have been coming here since it opened. Being from New England, I'm always on the lookout for a decent seafood spot (which is harder to find here than you might imagine) and this one fills the bill. I can always depend on great scallops, shrimp, oysters (including a $1 oyster happy hr), you name it. In addition, last night my gf and I split a goat cheese salad that she said was one of the best salads she's had in a while. To quote her, "many places overcharge you for a plate of lettuce and something on top that you could make on your own, this one was unique and delicious".  Yes it gets crowded, but we had a reservation and after a couple of people near our table left the bar, it was no more crowded or loud than a average NYC spot. The bar scene is hip and the cocktail selection decent.  Recommended.

OMG the happy hour oysters are AMAZING!! This place is so chill. Only minor problem is that during happy hour the service is a bit slow, but the deliciousness of the oysters make up for it.

For beer, get the Mikkeller draft for some nice fruity note from raspberry.

Happy Hour on Weekdays from 5-7PM, Dollar Oysters + $1 off drafts or wine by the glass.

The Orange wine on the menu was not available so I ended up getting another glass of Orange wine (forgot the name) but it was really nice!

Super friendly service, attentive servers even though they are very busy, great cozy atmosphere and perfect place for a date or chill with a couple friends! I have yet to explore their food menu (except for the oysters) to make any judgement about the food. One thig for sure, I will definitely be back for more happy hours since I live nearby.

The food/drinks were good, the service was HORRIBLE! Since we got there our waitress (Christen) had an attitude, also she dropped the Tabasco sauce all over my friend's pants, we ordered a bottle of wine and dropped it in the middle of our table hitting/breaking a candle, dropped the wine all over us and food was all covered with tiny pieces of glass, she didn't even apologized, the manager came replaced our food, otherwise the drinks are really good, we ended up leaving the place because we all felt uncomfortable with the bad looks/attitudes.
When we got the check, we were charged for the full amount. If I'm in charge of a restaurant and the waitress drop a dipping plate of tabasco sauce on one of my costumers, then dropped a glass of wine on another costume, the LEAST I can do is give a compensation as an apology.
TOO BAD, looked like it was a great place.... won't be back!!

I was craving oysters and found this place via Yelp. Who knew that the presentation of oysters could be so well thought out? My goodness, the little bottles of flavor to sample from were AMAZING - I enjoyed the habanero the most, and loved that it was in the form of a dropper. The shrimp cocktail was also divine and I had two of the party people cocktail.

You'll find super attentive bartenders here, and really really good seafood apps. It does get a little noisy though, but you won't notice after a cocktail (or two) and an oyster (or six).

Every visit is a pleasure. This is by far the best happy hour in the area. No rowdy 20 somethings here. This hip mix/ oyster bar is a gem with its seasonal selections. A little pricey but you get what you pay for. Seating can be tight and if you want a table at peak time it will not be easy. Recommend this stop for drinks and appetizers before heading out to BAM or into the city for a night on the town. They need to extend their happy hour oysters till later in the evening.

had a blast Friday and had to take the time to provide a review. First, the oysters are the best deal you will get for a happy hour. $1 dollar a piece and the come with some really interesting drops with an assortment of sauces.
The handcrafted drinks are 13.00 but worth it. Ingredients are fresh and the flavors are unique. I have to admit that the staff did not seem very light on their feet and that is why I did not give them a 5 star.

It took way to long to get a charcuterie plate out to us and our waitress was not very receptive of the delay. however, the hostess did come around to check on everyone and even asked us if the temperature was too out liking.
Highly recommended for a date or happy hour but just as the first stop. come early or make a reservation.

I love this place for the oyster happy hour. One dollar delicious oysters - always fresh. The shrimp cocktail and the deviled eggs (topped with crab and crunchy stuffl) are the bomb too. But it is small bar and really loud. I mean loud. Though the bartenders tonight tolerated my annoying friends - smiles on their faces and all - so polite. Extra thank you to those guys.

Coded racism. Were my friends and I loud? Yes, but we were sitting at a bar hanging out after my bridal shower and the manager came over and told us people were complaining about us being loud and something about the integrity of the bar. It's 5pm on a Saturday and we're sitting at a bar arguing about rap music. We're all native New Yorkers and this bar is full of transplants. There was someone sitting at the bar holding a baby, but that's ok for the integrity of your bar.

My favorite neighborhood restaurant and bar. The oysters are always so fresh! The Thai chili clams are a must. I have probably been here twenty times and have always had to get these clams! The drink and food menu rotate by the season and always something new to try. It can be a little pricey because the plates are small and you need to order a lot but you also get to try a lot

From now on I want all my oyster mignonettes served in tiny medicine droppers. Fully functional and totes cool. This place is your quintessential Brooklyn neighborhood bar. Really tiny but welcoming.

Between the music and the conversation it was really loud for my taste, but glad I went. I threw caution to the wind and asked the bartender to surprise me with a bourbon and he didn't disappoint!

First time trying this place! Great street parking and amazing oysters. Food I was not pleased with. Arrived cold and server was rude. Also if you're looking for a strong very EXPENSIVE drink from a hole in the wall, this is your place...

The only reason I didn't give this place a full 5 stars is because their cocktails aren't a part of their happy hour deal. And let's be honest, with the vast array of cocktails on the menu, you'd want to try them all, but that $13 price quickly stops you in your tracks.

What IS a part of happy hour? $1 oysters, beer and wine. The $1 oysters pulled my friend in and I followed. Never really been a big fan of oysters, but after 4 drinks, I'll try anything. And I did. They were delightful. Our bartenders Kevin and Matt were attentive and kept our cups full. Kevin made us drinks that weren't on the menu, so I can't even recommend any, but they were all good.

Not really a place for dinner. They had some some finger foods, but nothing was really appealing to me. After 20 oysters and 4 drinks (each), we left and had dinner somewhere else.

It's close to work so I will definitely return.

Went here with reservations for a group on a Saturday night. Our intentions were to grab cocktails and oysters before dinner elsewhere.

The interior is small, and it was LOUD. Like, not pleasant. Our waitress was fine but hard to hear.

My cocktail, the Seven Ravens, was great. It was large (I know, ice), and strong. A few others really enjoyed the Godfather Death. My husband got the Girl Without Hands and they should call this drink the Drink Without Alcohol. This was seriously a watered down Paloma. Someone else got one, too, and it was also watery as hell. For $14. Not sure what is happening there. This drink was so disappointing that I wouldn't go back unless I was with someone who really wanted to.

I can't speak on the food because I didn't want to eat anyone else's oysters since they were $3.50 a pop.

If I could give zero stars, I would. The bartender was incredibly rude when I came in, accusing me of "being that guy that kept closing my tab after every drink." I'd never been there before. Service was awful after that. Despite my better judgment, I stayed. He passed over me many times, seemingly on purpose, as it wasn't too busy.

The bar itself is incredibly overpriced, the place smells like very old fish (even for an oyster bar), and your presence feels like an imposition. Save your money and go to any of the fantastic bars in this area.
