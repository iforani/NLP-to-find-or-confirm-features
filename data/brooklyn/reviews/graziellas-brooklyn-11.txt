Ordered pizza on their website for takeout, so good and fast! Their crust is thin and the dough addictively chewy. The Margherita is a classic taste, and burrata really adds that deluxe mouth feel. The clam pizza is also bomb, but the real sleeper is their tiramis√π. If you're contemplating, get it! So light and sweet you could practically inhale it.

Got takeout from here today. The owner is super sweet and offered free coffee for waiting guests. Their chicken parm sandwich is big and juicy, and the grilled octopus is a smoky perfection. They source the stuff from Octopus Garden, a super legit local fish market, and it definitely shows. I would eat it all again right now if I could.

Also their desserts look bomb! They have NY cheesecake, cannoli, and even mud cake.

I'll be back to try the pies very soon. Hope they make it through these difficult times!

Went for in person dining during COVID. My first time out so was a little nervous to eat in public without a mask. They were great. All servers had their masks on properly (over nose and mouth) and kept their distance when coming to check on us. Tables are well spaced so it felt safe and clean. The food was amazing. It's like the chef poked into my head to see ally favorite dishes and made them all. Had the clams to start with the lobster ravioli as a main dish and Tiramisu for dessert. Delicious! Plan to come back again and will bring my parents when they can travel again post-pandemic.

Wow this place was actually amazing and very accommodating. I would definitely return. I called ahead to make a reservation for rooftop on a Saturday night at 930. They texted me with a reminder. Before even ordering I could smell the food and I couldn't wait to eat. I ordered calamari for an appetizer and the Blue Crab ravioli for a main. My partner ordered the kale salad with salmon and a pizza. DELICIOUS! The waiter was great the food, drinks, and ambience was fantastic! Highly recommended. Great work during Covid.

Thin crust, fresh mozzarella.. I only order Margherita's. Only exception, is sometimes I'll have them add fresh or roasted garlic. 1 time I got caramelized onions, which also meshed well.
  Perfect cheese to sauce to crust ratio.. just right in every way. Only critique is I wish they offered a larger sized pie on the menu than the 12" & 16" inch.. perhaps a 20"  .... Other than Di'Fara's on ave J, this is my new favorite.

Coming through day long presentations our crew needed some sustenance to maintain our focus. Luckily this beautiful place is located near us so we ordered some of their classics.

The dough is so light and yet crispy with the right amount of doughy-ness. The toppings especially the pepperoni and sausage taste exactly like that: the pure essence of meat. Not super preserved or grocery store level quality. This is the real deal.

We had the pizza for takeout but I can only imagine how amazing it is in store! Keeping churning out great 'za!

Been ordering weekly from Graziellas for 3 years. I live two blocks from their location, used to order online through yelp but they just discontinued that arrangement. Their own website purported that 2 blocks was too far for a delivery but finally found a delivery outfit willing to make the long-range 600ft drop-off. Made an order. 2 hours later called to enquire and they had 'missed the ticket'.  Good luck Graziellas, I'm nothing to you today but there's a long winter ahead and your accountant will miss me.

First stop in NYC and we needed some
Italian food in Brooklyn near our air bnb. This place was a everything we could have dreamed of: loud, bustling, and delicious. The chicken parmigiana was the best I have had in my life. I woke up this morning still thinking of it, that's how good it was! You won't get NY style pizza here as it's a very thin crust, however they bake it in their wood fire oven so it still does not disappoint. We didn't try any but make sure to hit us their bakery display and gelato on the way out.

Beautiful Italian restaurant.this place is eloquently made the inside and outside. I hate that fact that they don't give bread anymore unless you ask. The waitresses were very nice and accommodating they were gettin saoked tryin to bring us out food i felt so bad. The rain started comming down so hard out of no where. On that note we couldn't really enjoy our food we ate alittle and decided to take it to go. The food was very delicious and portioned well. I had the shrimp penne and omg god it was so tastey , it could of been a little more salt but maybe not I dont need high blood lol. The problem i had with ny penne is the srlhrimp it was like 4 or 5 wish it was more and they weren't that big,therefore it should have been more but overall it was good. I didnt get to taste everyone else dish but i did taste my boyfriends , he had crab ravioli and that was great unfortunately you only get 4 but they were very big and tastey also.my mom stuff shrimp and his mom chicken parm look so good and they said it was very good. Even the presentation was grand. They had a selection of wines and spirits, but I stuck to my old faithful ginger ale. I will definately be returning so I could actually sit down and enjoy my food. Its hard when you have to rush your food and then take a to go bag. Yes let me not forget the prices qerent bad either they range from 18 to 25 maybe more i didnt look at the whole menu im sure the seafood probably was more. This restaurant could be reccomended as a night out with the family ,friends or a date its a all around nice place.

One day in September, I was craving Italian and decided to search Yelp for some authentic Italian restaurants nearby. I found Graziella's, look at their reviews and photos & told my boyfriend let's head there.

For appetizers, we decided to step out of our comfort zone and order the baby octopus. It was very chewy but very good.
For the entree, I ordered the linguine Fra Diavolo- which came with shrimp, mussels, clams and calamari. I took a chance because I've never eaten mussels and clams. My boyfriend went with plain ole spaghetti and meatballs. I really really enjoyed my meal and it has become my regular each time I returned. Their penne a la vodka is delicious as well.

When we recently went in January, we ordered fennel shrimps as an appetizer and they were definitely appetizing.
Their food is very enjoyable. The staff is always welcoming. I'm very glad I found this restaurant and it is far from disappointing, I would definitely recommend!

Graziella's is always a great time. The servers are always friendly and welcoming and the food.....is so so good. I always try a new entree  when I come in addition to sharing a pizza. The margarita pizza is a constant when we come here. The crust is thin so it's not overpowering with dough, and the sauce and cheese are packed with flavor.

This time I got the lobster and crab tortellini, and I almost asked for another to take home. It was so fresh and the sauce that it came in was buttery and creamy with whatever addictive flavor. Most importantly, they give you a lot so you're not hungry after, but my greedy self just wanted more for the next day.

When you come, you can get any entree and enjoy it, but my favorite after coming here 10 or more times is now the lobster and crab tortellini!

Size of pizza for 27$ is a joke. Tiniest dough looks like they were out of dough. No pizza sauce. They saved on all ingedients. Do Not order if you do not want to be disapointed. I ve been travelling to Naples few times, it should not be like that. It is a Joke. Was hesitating 1 star or 2 star and put 2 star because when i found some sauce on pizza it was ok and was almost no burrata but when i found it with microscope it was ok.

Sometimes for work I have to order 20-30 pizzas for pick up so it is safe to say I am a trusted authority on the topic of pizza. This my friends, provides not only high quality food but also service.

We ordered 20 pizzas and kind of needed them in a rush. Tall order, am I right? Anyway, Graziella's rose to the occasion and shattered expectations by making all of them in 30-40 minutes. These are high quality wood fire pies people! To make that many that fast and have them tasting better than any other slice in Brooklyn is nothing short of incredible. We also had some gluten free pizza as well which is not really my thing but now you can bring your gluten free tinder date here.

To top it all off, the owner Vito greeted me and thanked me for the business. He even threw in a few cannolis as a thank you. It could not have been a more welcoming environment. The food was fantastic, the service was great and the pizza even tasted good the next day. That's right, I brought some home. Next time I'm in the area I will 100000% be going back. If you don't at least give this place a try you're blowing it

Came here for an impromptu dinner with two people.

Highlights of the meal: We sat upstairs on the roof, the octopus appetizer was cooked perfectly and the cucumber spritz was very refreshing.

The rest of the food was just okay. We ordered the  pasta special - the duck ragu, shrimp parmagiana and the orecchiette with broccoli rabe and sausage.  All three dishes were lacking in flavor and they took a long time to come out. Overall, the service was pretty slow.

Skip having a meal here. I would only suggest sitting upstairs when the weather is nice and drinking a spritz.

Amazing, Graziella's is the closest you'll get to a place that has amazing pasta dishes, calamari & pizza.

- Must try the Calamari, Rigatoni pasta, Raspberry Cheesecake (small, expensive but taste so good) & Meat pizza
- Restaurant areas small from the outside but has seating for ~60 people with seating upstairs & downstairs
- Tends to get crowded on weekends, late night or holidays
- Staff is friendly & food is ALWAYS consistent
- I usually order take out to avoid waiting for a reservation & the food is as good as when sit in

Not that many good if any Italian restaurants in this neighborhood but if your looking for one. COME HERE, you will not regret it

Amazing staff and great good. I placed a delivery order thru Postmates and it came with an issue. Postmates Customer service may suck but Graziella's personally handled the issue and delivered a new piping hot pizza within 15 minutes. Accidents happen but it's what happens in the end that matters. Thank you so much for a delicious dinner!! The gluten free pizza was great and I will be ordering again from the restaurant itself!

This is a lovely restaurant near my alma mater. I try to get there whenever I'm in the neighborhood.
On the most recent visit, my friends and I shared a pizza and had cocktails. Everything was good, the thin crust pizza is perfection. It is a family friendly restaurant and not very big, so if you were going out for a date night, you might want to go a little later in the evening. It gets loud when families with kids are in full force. Staff is very friendly.

Graziella was one of my fav neighborhood family restaurants for 25 yrs. It's the 3rd time Ive eaten there since covid allowed outdoor seating. Each time the food is not up to par. I didn't really want to go yesterday but one of few places that has enough social distancing in Fort Greene and a friend insisted.  So yesterday had brunch with friends- like I said plenty of room for social distancing but mediocre service and frozen drinks watery with lil alcohol. Waiter partially forgot order and acted rushed. I usually order calamari, stuffed clams and seafood entree. It was all bland very little seasoning except too much salt on bread. Anyway I just can't eat there again, and I wish it wasn't the case.

I organized a celebratory dinner for about 25+ high school students and adult chaperones at this place and I really have to commend the restaurant for handling it so nicely. They were very easy to communicate with over the phone - I spoke with the owner Gino, and he seemed friendly, and was present the night of the meal and lovely then as well. When I called to confirm our reservation the woman picking up the phone knew about it without needing to find a manager so that was re-assuring. When we arrived our tables were ready, and our waiter (Edwin?) was super nice and generally great throughout the meal. I didn't need to pre-pay, but a standard gratuity was included on our final bill, which feels very fair for a large group. I had asked the waiter if it was possible to make a separate check for alcoholic beverages if any of the adults chose to drink, and while it didn't end up being necessary, he seemed happy to do it. Also, I had apparently miscounted the number in our party and they accommodated us by adding more tables/chairs, and were friendly about it to boot.

I ordered salad and pizza for the group and the food came out in reasonable intervals and was actually delicious! I would totally come back here for pizza, and would venture to try other things off the menu as well. For groups without children they apparently have a rooftop terrace that they use during the warmer months, but I didn't get a chance to see it on this visit. I would definitely use this place again the next time I need to organize something for the kids (if they'll have us), and I would also happily return to sit outside on a date/girls night.

Delicious, delicious, delish!  Granted, I've only ordered delivery, but Graziella's is my first choice when ordering take out. Normally I order a dozen baked clams, the clams - pancetta pizza, lasagna, lemon chicken, and limoncello cake.  Yup, that's my normal solid delivery order, and I ask them to hold the carbs.  They never disappoint.

The other night I called for delivery and the hostess who helped with my order took the time to jog my memory of my usual order since it had been a while. I ordered the clams-pancetta pizza, lasagna.   When it came to dessert she suggested  try something different.  It didn't take long for me to agree with the tiramisu.

When it comes to all around comfort food, this is the place to satisfy your needs.  The staff is patient, friendly, and outgoing.

Delivery comes with lighting speed, presenting hot food from polite and presentable delivery messengers.

I'm a happy stuffed bird, and shall you ever crave some kicking Italian food, pizza from a wood burning brick oven, then Graziella's is the place.

Most of the best Italian food places are concentrated in Little Italy and Bay Ridge, but this is a good option on this side of the borough. The plating and presentation is nice but the food itself is just average. Especially considering the astronomical prices. They do have some of the best tiramisu I've ever had. Pro tip: wait is outrageous make a reservation.

Graziella's is that kind of low key, welcoming, pizza place that everybody would like to have in their neighborhood.

There is plenty of dining space here, as the restaurant is on two floors, so you will never have problems finding a table here. The bar has one TV, so that if you don't care about sports you are not surrounded by an endless number of loud TVs, and if you care you can always ask the bartenders to put the game on. The bartenders are always nice and in a good mood. If anything, I wish they had better beers on tap.

The wood-burning brick oven makes a tasty pizza. The dough is extra thin, which makes it more crisp and less chewy than I would like, but the tomato sauce and the mozzarella are both high quality and fresh. This is a solid pizza. Added bonus: each pie comes in two sizes, 12" ($13-17) and 16" ($20-25).

The fried calamari are perfectly crisp and tasty, and the menu offers a couple of interesting salads, like beets and fried goat cheese. Who wouldn't love to try fried goat cheese?! Also, the grilled baby octopus packs a ton of flavor; I loved this dish.

By the bar there is also a large ice cream station, as this is one of the few places where you can get an ice cream in this neighborhood. Their ice cream apparently is flown directly from Italy, and it certainly tastes good. Give the hazelnut a try.

I particularly like to come to Graziella's in the summer, as the second floor has a terrace overlooking a stretch of Vanderbilt Avenue that  is relatively quiet and with many trees. Perfect place to unwind after a long day at work when you don't feel like cooking, while enjoying a pizza and a beer under a warm Brooklyn summer sky.

Pretty basic pizza place that has a great outdoor second floor space. Maybe the best thing about the restaurant. The pizza was good and the salad was standard.

Good neighborhood spot with friendly service. Would not make a special trip to visit though. The food was just ok.

Get the pancetta and clam pizza, rack of lamb, and linguini. They were the best dishes that we had. We also tried the burrata pizza, squid ink linguini, calamari, caesar salad, baked clams, chicken parm. These were not great.

Overall, good service and prices, homey environment, and good for groups.

‚ÄãGraziella's is a wonderful family location to get your eat on. We recently attended a birthday‚Äãparty‚Äã at the location and the staff did a wonderful job accommodating‚Äã‚Äã us.

The party was slated for 11:00 am‚Äã,  and the staff and tables were ready to go. The staff gave all the kids balloons‚Äã, while we waited. The tables had juice‚Äã and pizza stickers for kids to spend some time‚Äã making‚Äã thier own sticker‚Äã‚Äãr pizza's. Afterward, small inidivauls pizza crust came out and kids were allowed to make their own personal pizza's with ingrediants that were brought out directly on the tables. After the kids pizza's were made, the staff took them and we were entertained by a magician.

Once the magician was over, the kid's pizza was brought‚Äã‚Äã out‚Äã. For adult,‚Äãs we have oun regular‚Äã size pizzas which‚Äã‚Äãc were delicias and a trio of salds that were scrumptious‚Äã. Lastly, the bar was open, and it allowed the parents to get a drink in while the kiddies were entertained.

All in all, Graziella's was an excellent place to host a kids party. I would recommend‚Äã to anyone in the area to ‚Äãhave an open mind and allow this place to host your next party.

Full disclosure - we tried to go to LaRina first, but the wait was just too long. Graziella's has been on my list since moving to Brooklyn a year ago, so I was excited to try due to all of the amazing Yelp reviews. As soon as we walked in, we knew that this was where we needed to be! Old school, chill Italian restaurant setting. It was crowded around 8 on a Saturday, but we were still able to sit immediately. We wanted so many things on the menu, but went with the rigatoni alla norma and chicken parm with a side of penne alla vodka. I always hesitate to get anything in a red sauce from a restaurant I haven't been to before, but I just had a good feeling here - it was incredible! The real star though - the penne alla vodka. Probably the best we've had in a while. Cannot wait to come back and try additional dishes!

I am so glad I found this place. I love Italian food and have not been able to find a good place since La Traviatta closed. Service was excellent from the time we walked in. Drinks were bomb - I had an eggnog martini. My husband had veal parmigiana and I had shrimp parmigiana. We both cleaned our plates - delish! Lastly, music and atmosphere had a down home vibe. I'll definitely be back.

This little neighborhood spot feels like a family owned restaurant. There is plenty of charm and years of collecting things. The spaghetti and meatballs and sausage was okay. The pasta was al dents, the balls were moist and pork was tasty. The sauce was fresh and light. There wasn't anything too special about this dish.

We enjoyed some wood fired white pizza with Broccoli Rabe and Caramelized onions. The crust was crispy and toasted in parts and chewy in other parts. The combination was delightful.

I coordinate catering for my Studio Crew and Graziella's was amazing!! I feed 40 people several times a month and I highly recommend this vendor. Thanks again for an amazing meal.

I ordered delivery and while I appreciated the prompt service, I was disappointed in the thoroughly burnt pizza that I received. I have ordered from Graziella's in the past and have always enjoyed good service and great pizza, and I will continue to order from them, but this is disappointing.

Finally had a chance to get food from here last night and it was delicious. More importantly, service was great and could not have been friendlier, more professional or attentive. These guys are doing it right and taking care of the neighborhood. Will definitely be back soon.

Food is fresh, cooked to order, and generous portions.  Prices are good as well.  Highly recommended
