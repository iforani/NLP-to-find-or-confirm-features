Went to Miss Ada's on a warm summer evening after work with two friends.  Pre-Covid, if you were looking for somewhere to unwind with friends after a long day, this place is it. While we didn't have a reservation, the wait wasn't too bad and we sat in Fort Greene Park about a block away.

Once we got in, we ordered a few small plates for the table. The beet hummus, whipped ricotta, and a special -- spicy hummus with small cubes of watermelon and cheese on top. Hands down the best hummus I've ever had in my life (with the beet hummus being a close second.) It was the perfect blend of refreshing, filling, lightness, good karma and then some. I still rave about it to people. My friends who grew up abroad eating hummus on a regular basis aren't normally impressed with the fad of different flavors of hummus. They call it ruining a perfectly good dish -- but then I took them to Miss Ada's and they were completely blown away and now are Miss Ada converts.

Recently got delivery again due to COVID, and was happy to have those memories of dining in flood back again -- same great service and food. I will continue to worship at the alter of Miss Ada. This stuff feeds your soul.

P.S. they have an amazing cocktail list, too.

Miss Ada is a special place. Pre-COVID, mid-COVID -- whatever angle you want to take, Miss Ada looks like a queen. This spot had been on my list for quite some time before I finally visited. I live on the UWS and rarely venture to Brooklyn, which is the primary reason I didn't come here sooner. Though had I lived in the neighborhood without knowledge of the NYC restaurant scene, I probably wouldn't have given Miss Ada a second glance. It's unassuming and fairly bare bones. But the product and hospitality coming out this place is as excellent as you'll find in the whole city. If you like Mediterranean fare, coming here is a no-brainer. You'll find elevated Israeli classics that are true to their roots with an added layer of creativity. It has adapted beautifully to the new COVID reality and remains a powerhouse in the scene.

Came to Miss Ada last Saturday night. We had an 8pm reservation, but weren't able to be seated until around 8:40. On some nights I'd be highly bothered, but the staff here made it all worth it. After we were waiting for about 10-15 minutes, the host brought us complimentary frozen drinks (a marg for the bf and a frosé for moi) as a gesture of appreciation for our patience. Another 15 or so minutes went by and as we were finishing up our first round, the host scurried back and informed us that our table would be ready very soon but that he'd happily bring us a second round, on them, if we'd like. We declined but thanked him graciously. Truthfully, since COVID began, I haven't been able to just stand around socially and chat with a drink in hand, so the experience was refreshing (we were on the sidewalk, Miss Ada is still fully outdoors for COVID).

Once we were finally led to our table, the host assured us that he would comp some small plates for us, which he did. They really do value customer satisfaction here and the place overall is just so warm and welcoming. Part of why I wanted to come to Miss Ada was the famed backyard garden, which is as quaint and romantic as advertised. The tables are maybe a tiny bit too close together but not nearly as bad as what I've seen elsewhere. The setup is thoughtful and makes for a great dining experience.

While the frozen drinks were definitely the highlight cocktail-wise (though we also tried the lavender old-fashioned, which was yummy), the wine menu was also powerful in its own right. An emphasis on natural, biodynamic wines with a diverse selection of by-the-glass options. I've generally been hesitant to get into orange wines since my first few tastes in the past weren't to my liking, but I felt adventurous here and ordered a glass once our food started arriving. I was rewarded for my curiosity -- the wine was funky and earthy but not overpoweringly bold, just what I was in the mood for. Just take their advice here!

Now onto the main event. Truly magical food. The menu here is huge (even by pre-COVID standards), so it's really quite a challenge to deliberate. Sharing is recommended, encouraged, essentially mandatory, and should you not want to share maybe just take your business elsewhere? Sorry, I don't mean that. You'd just be silly not to want to try to cover every last crevice of this menu. The dips and kebabs are the royalty but it's all fair game. They're known for their za'atar-crusted salmon and their brick chicken entrees as well, but my recommendation is skip the mains, go the the littles. I'd say we covered good ground. Eats, below:

Whipped Ricotta w/ Brown Butter, Honey, Sage: A++
This is truly mind-blowing. I could forgo all dessert for the rest of my life and just eat this. Seriously heavenly, decadent perfection. Sweet, rich, creamy, all the good stuff.

Lamb Shawarma Hummus w Amba, Parsley: A++
It's clear why they're known for their dips here. Another unbelievable dish, served with pita but honestly you could easily just eat this straight. Rich, super flavorful and had me missing Israel.

Falafel w/ Feta, Olives, Green Tahini: A++
Okay, so speaking of Israel, the best falafel I've ever had was undoubtably there. But if you want my vote for the best *fancy* falafel, Miss Ada wins in a landslide. The perfect amount of crisp on the outside and the green tahini was just next-level tasty.

Salmon Belly kebab w/ Labne, Charmoula: A
Wasn't quick enough to get a picture before we dug in but this was fantastic. Melt-in-your mouth good. One of the smaller skewers on the menu so ordering this could enable you to try more dishes.

Short Rib w/ Red Cabbage, Israeli Mole: A+
Another perfectly seasoned, well-executed and varied dish. These kebabs are next-level and ideal for sharing. Great on their own, better in the mole.

Amazing food we got for takeout. I'd love to come back to dine in, but if not during covid, we will definitely be back for takeout or delivery soon.

The 3 for $25 deal is a great way to try multiple things. The whipped ricotta was my absolute favorite. The brown butter, honey, and sage were an amazing combo (I wish I could eat it every day). The babaganoush was just as good as all the other reviews say - highly recommend. The sweet potato humus wasn't a fav but it was good to try something different. These 3 small plates with the pita were enough to make two of us full for dinner!

The lamb shawarma was delicious and a pretty good portion size. The lamb was very tender and flavorful. The hanger steak entrée was hands down the best item we ordered. Cooked medium rare, it was so tender and even after our 15min walk home carrying the takeout, it was still so amazing. One of the best things we've eaten in a long time.

All servers were wearing masks from the outdoor dining we could see. Ordering online was very eaay and the website says how long orders should take before you order, and the order confirmation says the time to pick it up. Since our food was slightly (only a few min) delayed, the host offered us frosés while we waited, which was extremely nice. Best takeout experience we've had during covid.
Can't wait to come back!

If you have a taste for quality Mediterranean food this is the place to go
The service is great!!!
The drinks are amazing as well. The hotty toddy was by far my favorite. Reminded me of a nice lemon tea. But spiked.

They are doing outdoor dining only atm. But no heated lamps and it's pretty unshielded so if there is heavy winds or rain come prepared

The food at this place was incredible and the entire meal was very affordable. We ordered the Hummus (5/5), New York Strip (5/5), and the Hanger Steak (4/5). They provide ENDLESS warm pieces of Pita Bread with a large portion of delicious Hummus. The quality of the New York Strip was very good and the peppers and sauces that they used to garnish the plate with made the dish very flavorful. The hanger steak was also very good, but if I came back I would probably just have 2 orders of the New York Strip instead.

Unfortunately the service was very poor the night we went. Granted i've only been to this place once, so it could have been a fluke. That said, it took very long for us to get our food and the dishes were staggered very oddly. For example we got our hummus very quickly but after we finished we had to wait 25-30 minutes before we got  our next dish.

Overall I loved this place and will definitely be back.

Delicious, delicious, delicious! I have had the pleasure of traveling to the Mediterranean and I must say, this matches up to real authentic Mediterranean food. The food here is fresh and bursting with flavors. For drinks I had the "Frose" and a nice glass of red wine. The drinks were decadent and a perfect pairing with the food. We decided to skip entrees and order a bunch of small plates to share. We ordered the following:

Whipped Ricotta: Delicious, creamy whipped blend.
Babaganoush: Bursting with flavors.
Lamb Shawarma: Absolutely flavorful and well thought out.
Israeli Dumplings: A-mazing, the green sauce on top of it was to die for.
Albacore Tuna Skewer: This may have been my least favorite of everything because it was a tad bit on the dry side but the sauce it comes with makes it worth the while.
Kofta Kebab: The lamb was wrapped in a cinnamon stick. Ironically you do get a slight hint of cinnamon flavor as you bite into it.

The cherry on top was that the service was splendid. This place is really wonderful. I would highly suggest making a reservation as it visibly fills up quickly. Thank you Miss Ada!

I came here around a year ago for dine in, and the food was superb. The restaurant has reopened with outdoor dining recently, so I came here on a Saturday night and got take out.
The take out process is seamless and efficient. I ordered online before I arrived. On the receipt, it tells you that your order will be ready in 20 - 25 minutes.
When I arrived at Miss Ada, the food was already ready, and I got it in one minute after I got there.
I got the three appetizers for $25. These were the whipped ricotta with honey, muhammara, and sweet potato hummus. The sweet potato hummus and whipped ricotta were amazingly delicious, would highly recommend these. The muhammara I didn't like as much, I've had a really good version at another place.
I love the food here, and will definitely be coming to eat, and ordering more in future.

Nabbed a garden seating reservation for 3. We got the crispy cauliflower ($13). The breading on this was so crunchy and tasty and it paired perfectly with the slightly sweet sauce it came with. We also had the fall salad hummus ($13) which came with some fluffy pita. The squash, shiitake, and rosemary was a perfect earthy combo of toppings for the hummus. Next was the stracciatella ($16), a delicious, creamy chilled cheese soup with basil and tomato. The flavor was really delicate and light, probably my favorite dish of the meal. The shakshuka ($18) was probably the most underwhelming, too much cinnamon and slightly too salty. Also the meat eaters split the shawarma ($16) and the kofta kebab ($13) but I can't comment on that. They seemed to enjoy those a lot!

Service was super nice but made us order all our food at once. Also our table was very small (a 2 person table really) and they kept putting our dishes on the edges and corners of the table which made me nervous. Good thing we practically inhaled all our food to make room since it was (mostly) so good!

Lots of things can be made vegan!

COVID times assessment: make sure you get a reservation in advance. They release slots an hour in advance. It fills up. The garden is really nice if you can get a spot there. There is a 90 min limit on dinner and a 60 min limit on brunch.

We had a reservation for 2 people on a Saturday around 11a - it wasn't super crowded but every table was filled (note: some were definitely not socially-distanced safe; see pics).

Between 2, we ordered:
- the Hummus,
- the Baba Ganoush,
- the Shakshuka,
- a Coffee,
- and a Veridian.

Both the Hummus and the Shakshuka were extremely flavorful. The Baba Ganoush was great but pales in comparison to the other two dishes. They charge extra for pita bread but aren't upfront about it. The coffee was ok. The Veridian was light and refreshing.

Would definitely recommend trying the Hummus and would love to check out their back patio next time!

This is next level Mediterranean food
Would suggest making a reservation, since they tend to fill up their seating. The waiter informed us about the menu portion sizes since it was our first time visiting.
We ordered:
Whipped Ricotta - so good with pita, but also very filling
Lamb Shwarma Hummus - all hummus should have lamb. The spices make the dish so flavorful
Falafel - a little too bitter for my tastes, but perfectly crispy
1/2 Brick Chicken - a little too salty for some pieces, but the chicken breast were moist and not dry
Kofta Kebab - full of flavor and it reminded me of eating ground beef

;tldr can't go wrong with pita and hummus- their pita is so fluffy and we ended up ordering extra

Maybe the best delivery of all time? Miss Ada way exceeded expectations, even admist all the shutdowns and craziness.

We ordered the shawarma hummus, babaganoush, chicken schnitzel, and a bottle Da Mar Prosecco. We loved the Prosecco and it was super reasonable at $25. Overall, the meal was pretty pricey for takeout- but so so worth it. Everything was perfect and delicious. I really loved the babaganoush, it was probably one of the best I've ever had! The meal also came with 4 large, fresh, and fluffy pitas that made out meal complete.

If you're thinking about ordering from here - definitely do it! It would also be fun to order pickup and enjoy in nearby Fort Greene Park...

The food and drinks here are so good. I got the Israeli dumplings which were my favorite- crispy and flavorful and filling. Followed by the crusted salmon which was perfectly cooked and beautifully presented. I got the daiquiri which was subtle and refreshing and not overpowering like some cocktails can be at other places. Service was great, we sat outside which was covered. I will definitely be back to try the rest of the menu because it's a big menu with a lot of delicious sounding items on it :)

Have been wanting to go to this place for a while now and finally bit the bullet and came on a sunday evening with my girlfriend. While there was a 30 minute wait since we didn't have a reservation, we happily walked nextdoor to a cute little wine barto wait (even if you don't have to wait, I highly recommend stopping here anyway, very refreshing wine selection).

We started with the hummus platter, which was fantastic. Super creamy, very flavorful. I think my girlfriend and I would have licked the plate clean if there was no one around. Next we went with the octopus, which I have to say has been my favorite I've ever had. perfectly cooked, paired with these delicious peppers that give it just a little kick. The portion was also very very generous. I could have eaten this again for my entre as well if I didn't have a need to try as much as possible.  We finished the evening with the salmon, which again I cannot say enough good things about. The flavors were just incredible. You have to try and get a little piece of everything on the dish in a bite, highly recommend. We also had a very refreshing cocktail to go with dinner, the veridian, which like everything that night was made with such care and high quality. Well done.

Quarantine takeout review:

Ordered an incredible spread for Friday night, including:
- 3 small plates for $25: babaganoush 4.5/5, sweet potato hummus 4.5/5, and muhammara 5/5
- 1 whipped ricotta $10 5/5 (would give this 6/5 stars really, it's - incredible)
- salmon belly crudo $14 (4.5/5)
-zaatar crusted salmon $25 (3.5/5)
- crudités $4 (1/5)
- tres leches cake $7 (3/5)

We also ordered the Dead Sea cocktails (5/5), they were super delicious and much better than what we were expecting from to-go cocktails.

Biggest takeaways: stick with the dips, get all the ricotta, order some extra pita and cocktails and call it a successful night.

I've heard so much hype about Miss Ada, and was finally able to score a  brunch reservation for me and 3 friends.

I have to say that there were a couple of outstanding dishes:
1. whipped ricotta (5/5)
2. malawach (4.5/5)

I absolutely love whipped ricotta and have had my fair share and this one really shone (other notable mentions are Misi's whipped ricotta toast and Olea's whipped ricotta).

The rest of the items were good and the pita was fresh, but comparable to other good israeli places in the city.

Only con was the waitress was a bit condescending to us, which put a slight sour note on the whole experience.

Looking for an affordable next-level Michelin star Mediterranean food with amazing service? You have to try Miss Ada. My friend and I were blown away by how delicious the food was. We tried multiple dips, pita bread,falafel and my friend also tried a skewer.
classic hummus
whipped ricotta with brown butter, honey . This is so unique and incredible, definitely a must!
Muhammara - red pepper hummus this was my fave though. The cumin hit the spot and loved all the other flavors
babaghanoush- this was my friend's fave. Loved the eggplant was perfectly puréed
Labneh- too many times garlic overpowers other flavors but not at Miss ada. Perfect balance.
falafel - this was lightly fried and crispy. There was no hint of oil and I like that.
Pita bread was fluffy and warm. Our server and our homegirl Marianela made sure we had a good experience. The wait is long here coz of limited seating but worth making a trip to Brooklyn

My Al fresco dining experience at Miss Ada was excellent. We tried the Lamb Shawarma hummus, short rib kebab, and Hangar steak- all of which were excellent. Service was friendly and attentive, even on a busy Thursday night. I look forward to going back!

This was my absolute favorite meal in such a long time. Came here with three girlfriends and ordered several items to share. First of all, ambience! It's intimate & cozy, inviting, dimly lit with a view of the kitchen. It warmly says "come inside. good things are here". Even the bathroom located in the basement level carries the cozy attention to detail.

The food. Oh my word everything was SO good. From the hummus to babghanoush, and all of the other items that are escaping me right now. Each dish exploded with flavor. The cocktails were delicious and creative. I started with the Lavender  Old Fashioned and finished with the cucumber mezcal drink. Everything was so perfect.

I'm not huge on dessert and don't quite recall the two we shared, but they were good enough. Can't wait to come back.

The chicken liver bowl is to die for. Hands down the most delicious poultry infused dip of any sort. Alone is worth the trip. You're welcome.

I wanted to go down the list from best dish to most ok- good dish but 2nd most impressive thing about Miss Ada wasn't a dish. It was the romantic, effervescent, easy and sophisticated atmosphere. You just got to go to know it for yourself.

3rd- we enjoyed their cumin shashuka thoroughly as something we've never had but are now so motivated to  replicate on our own.

3rd- actually, it's a tie between the shashuka and their cocktails. Their bourbon orange egg white and Dead Sea cocktails were pretty on-point.

4th- the whipped ricotta was a very good starter w warmed pillowy wheat pita.

Then, we have the less than perfect but still yummies: lamb shawarma, octopus (too salty) and kunefe dessert- best hot but once cooled we can sorta tell this wasn't a made to order thing. Decent lavender cardamom flavors tho.

All said, we were happily and thoroughly patronized at this super low key, stylish and exciting restaurant and cannot wait to return.

Honestly amazing food but a few things that bothered me:

1. potions are absolutely tiny and each skewer order is just one skewer for $15??
2. you have to go at 5:30 and lineup or no shot you're getting in without a wait
3. expensive and small portions

But the ricotta honey is absolutely insane. A the red pepper hummus is absolutely insane. Chill vibe good date spot.

We came back to Miss Ada a few weeks ago. We came earlier in evening and was able to grab a table this time. It was a lot more comfortable.

We ordered a bunch of enjoyable dips. The sweet potato, the veggie, baba. All were amazingly flavorful and addicting.  We also order two short rib skewers and a shawarma hummus which was on the salty side.  Everything though is great with the warm pita.

I def enjoyed this visit better and love the food here. The staff is pleasant. A table is def the way to go.

We were in the mood for Mediterranean and I saw Miss Ada on yelp. I tried getting reservations for a whole week with no avail. I called and the hostess on the phone, she said to come in there shouldn't be a problem getting a table at that time. The longest we would have to wait is 30 mins. Well not to bad I thought, right? We show up walk in and the restaurant is packed.  We ask the hostess how long and she tells us 2 hours but the bar is about 15 mins. I mean, I guess okay.. Repeat with me.. Bars are for drinks, Tables are for food! At least that is the case here, because they added an extra 4 bar stools to this bar so you can't really lift your arms to eat anything or sit properly!!  The restaurant is cute but small. There isn't a area to wait for your table/bar stool.  Where ever you stand you are in the way of a server or on top of a table that is eating. Also, There is suppose to be a garden dining area but it looks like they are not using it anymore.

We were finally seated at the corner of the bar. A very awkward seating arrangement. Remember I told you about those extra seats, well we were the lucky winners to get them! Our legs were entangled and we were both trying to figure out how they would fit our food on this small amount of space in front of us.  Plus we had some immature, obnoxious drunk couple to the right annoying us through out dinner.  Moving along...

We looked at the menu and decided on a few dips, apps and a entree.

The dips we ordered were Babaganoush, which is a roasted eggplant dip. it was smooth and creamy. It had a ginger aioli which made it so special. It was absolutely delicious. We also had the ricotta with brown butter, honey and sage. Which also was super creamy and amazing. Another great dip to try. Our last dip was an Israeli salad hummus. It was roasted veggies on top of a classic chickpea hummus. it was also extremely tasty. All dips come with freshly made hot pita.

For an app we ordered falafel which came in lettuce leaves. It was three to an order. It had olive and a green tahini dressing. This was def an interesting take on falafel. It was moist and seasoned beautifully.  This app is for one person not to share!

For an entree we had the hanger steak-medium.  It also came with a succotash and peppers.  The steak came under done more of a rare and a little over seasoned.  The dish overall was good, it just needed to be refined a bit.

The food at Miss Adas especially the dips are especially delicious.  The staff here is very nice and try to please..  After saying that, There are a lot of mishaps that go on with seating mainly bc they don't have a waiting area. A group of two adults and a child walked in and invaded our space while we were eating in our already small cramped area at the bar during dinner. Staff consistently told them they couldn't sit or stand in the bar area. That it was reserved. They ignored them, squished and bullied there way into the small two person area with the small child on the left side of where we were seated. After 10mins of not getting their way they got the hint to leave. Or maybe it was because they told them enough times someone was coming for those seats. The bartender apologized to us for the issue.

I would only come here if I had solid reservations for a table. If we didn't have issues with our seating I would had given Miss Ada 4 stars. There were so many issues that made us feel so uncomfortable here.  Maybe they should fix the lay out and give a waiting area. Also, take out some bar stools so patrons can feel comfortable while eating there dinner at the bar.

Parking is a tad difficult (321)

On a short trip to New York, this was one of my friend's few recommendations, and Miss Ada did not disappoint!

THE WAIT: Four of us came here at 6:00 p.m. on a Friday. It was already packed, but luckily we were sat right away at a three-seater corner booth (so it was a bit tight, but we took it anyway). We could have sat outside where it was heated, or waited a couple hours for a table inside.

THE SERVICE: They were very busy but our server was friendly and our food came at a good pace!

THE COST: $260.20 before tips for a very filling dinner for four.

MUST-HAVES: Chicken Liver Hummus, NY Steak Skewers, Salmon Skewers, Octopus (the most tender I have ever had!).

See my photos for additional details!

More like 4.5 but I'll give it the full 5 since yolo.

The only reason this isn't a guaranteed 5 star is portion size and attitude.
--portion size - thought it was like 3 skewers per order. It was 1 each! Bug out.
--attitude - little snotty at the door. Showed up 20 min before they opened and was not very warmly received. "Hype place" attitude I call it

NOW for the good part - we got 4 dips and 4 skewers and 4 falafel.

Dips:
Ricotta honey - unbelievable
Labne - amazing
Muhammara - incredible

Falafel - amazing

Skewers:
Short rib - incredible.
Halloumi - amazing.
Sirloin steak - great.
Salmon - very good.

Honestly the food was exceptional. For a grading scale, see below:

"Unbelievable" - 9.5/10
"Incredible" - 9.4/10
"Amazing" - 9.2/10
"Great" - 8.2/10
"Very good" - 7.8/10

Highly highly recommend. Reservations seem tough and even getting there 20 min early it filled up right on the dot at 530 when it opened. But clearly with good reason....

This place is one of my favorite Mediterranean spots in NY- I don't get out to this area of Brooklyn as often, but when I am- I always go! Such fresh ingredients, you'll feel light & satisfied & full at the same time! The merguez hummus is so yummy & the market salad is huge & full of all the veggies that will make you feel so good :) I adore this place & the vibe is so cozy & inviting! Oh- get the Dead Sea cocktail. Obsessed. Won't regret the trek here - worth the extra trip to Bk!

Holy moly. There have been very few restaurants that have left me speechless and this is one of them. The hummus/dips are to die for. I think I even sat there in awe for a moment as I had my first bite of warm pita with each accompaniment.

We ordered the sweet potato hummus and whipped ricotta and WOW. It's difficult to even describe how delicious each of them were. The sweet potato hummus was a perfect combination of slightly sweet and smoky while the whipped ricotta was a literal dream--the sweetness alongside the slightest bit of saltiness was complex and had a beautiful depth to its flavor. I cannot rave about these two dishes enough.

We also had the Sabich and Malawach. The sabich was very good, but not as stellar as our small plates. I would probably opt for something else if I went again. The Malawach, on the other hand, was so amazing and flaky. Also, my boyfriend said that this was the only place he was able to find it this far.

Incredible restaurant, very nice people, beautiful atmosphere. They were very accommodating to our large group and I cannot wait to go back!

Come for the dips, leave having dessert!

The babaganoush is a familiar texture but the taste and spices are uniquely delish, the fried eggplant chip is a nice touch!  The labne surprisingly wasn't that special, but the whipped ricotta - I was eating it with a spoon. I do agree with another reviewer that more honey would make it consistently amazing. The chicken liver hummus Masabaha was rich, filling, and satisfying.  The pita that's served us warm, thick, and filling. Ordered veggies which was radishes, carrots and romaine - went perfect with the whipped ricotta and labne!

Short rib and haloumi skewers didn't disappoint, def liked the pickles, cabbage, and jalapeños that came with.

Got a special salad with baby kale, herbs, apples, plums and walnuts that was a perfect addition to all the dips. Miss ada fun cake was described like a tres leches but with cardamom and spice - was on the sweet side but the spices, salted caramel and honeycomb on top added texture and flavor.

Next will be brunch!

Before I came here, I was wary of some of the reviews detailing poor customer service and a rushed dining experience. I'm a firm believer in making your own opinion from your own experience though so I had to try it. I must say I was impressed and delighted at how amazing everything was!

I came here with a friend and we did not make a reservation. There was about a 30 minute wait on a Tuesday evening, so we walked around and looked in some of the shops down the street. The space is very narrow so on a full night there isn't really anywhere to wait inside.

My friend and I were seated at the bar,  which if you have bags and jackets with you like we did, can be a bit cramped. However the bartender still provided us with attentive service (he wasn't going anywhere and there are only so many seats at the bar), even though we did have a bit of a time fitting all our plates in front of us when they came. It seemed like everything we ordered magically appeared in front of us mere moments after we ordered it, but it felt like a moment of instant gratification rather than feeling rushed to eat and leave.

The food:
We ordered several small plates and two desserts. If you're eating out with a friend or two, I think that's the only way to do it, as some of the dishes are very rich and can be a lot for one person to tackle on their own. The whipped ricotta and honey was divine on their fluffy warm pita! We couldn't get enough of the fresh bread so we must have ordered extra three times (I think after a while the bartender stopped charging us for each order haha). The baba ganoush was tangy and well spiced! The Lima bean hummus (they had a few different varieties to choose from) was silky and smooth. And my favorite - the crispy cauliflower shawarma - was to die for! I am going to have to come back here once a month just to get an order of this for myself. It was the only thing I didn't want to share with my friend! The outside was crispy and crunchy with a soft yet firm inside. The flavor was smoky with a bit of spice and a sweet drizzle of honey. I will undoubtedly try and fail to replicate this at home. Finally, the two desserts we got were so decadent yet light. The fun cake was moist and sweet, like a tres leches cake, but the bits of honeycomb on top really added a nice bit of texture and sticky sweetness. The kanafeh was a delightful juxtaposition of textures and flavors, combining the crispy airiness of the kadaif with the smooth base of sweetened goat cheese served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Now I am absolutely not a goat cheese fan but this dessert was delicious and not too heavy if you're looking for a sweet way to finish your meal without bursting at the seams.

10/10 would recommend and I cannot wait to go here again soon!

We're spoiled in New York. There are lots of great restaurants out there where one can dine out in any country at any time of day or night. Sometimes it's magical. Sometimes there's a lot of hype around a restaurant and that restaurant lives up to or even exceeds that reputation. Sometimes, it's just dinner.

We arrived 5 minutes before our reservation and stood cramped in the entry area for 20 minutes waiting for our table while a table for two remained empty for the duration of our meal. There was some confusion as we were finally sat about who our server was; we were asked every 2 to 3 minutes by different people if we were ready to order within 2 minutes of sitting.  We aren't slow. We thought it was just attentive service with a bit of a misstep: it isn't. They want you in, they want you out, they want you gone.

The menu feels a little like a baby food buffet - 10 different kinds of pureed dips...do you really need sweet potato, carrot, beet and 3 different kinds of hummus on one menu when the only solid food is octopus (tiny) and cauliflower (very good)? AND also whipped ricotta and fava bean puree? Check your teeth at the door people - you won't need them for 90% of the small plates on this menu. It was tough to come up with a good well-rounded dinner on that basis, especially if you don't want to sop it all up with pita (which was again excellent, but it woke me at 520 am the next day like a giant rock in my stomach).

Cocktails were watery and very slow in arriving. In fact, the first onslaught of dishes came before our drinks. And then...BAM here's 4 plates of food all at once. They said plates would arrive when they arrive (like most places) but unlike places that care, they did nothing to pace the meal...a dish or two now, then the next 10 minutes later, etc. 4 at the exact same time, all warm dishes. It really rushed us in a way that was seriously unpleasant.

Baba Ganoush and cauliflower were very good. Hummus was good but no different from all the other israeli places that have gotten the right method down. Halloumi was ho-hum. Hanger steak was very good and well cooked.

Wait staff made it clear they don't want you to eat dessert - they just want you out, out, out I say! to get the next slackers in for their set.

Dining out is precious for us. It's a luxury and we want it to be a bit of an experience when we go. We have kids and busy lives like lots of people. We had free babysitting tonight and wanted a fun, relaxing meal to share. This wasn't it. The food was fine (albeit with a menu that absolutely lacks innovation, invention, variety or fun), the drinks were subpar (pretty in the glass but watery and slow to arrive), but sometimes it really is the rushed service that leaves a diner cold.

Slow down, Miss Ada. You move too fast. Give us a moment to enjoy what you do have to offer, and revisit your 90% puree menu. We have teeth and like to use them, sometimes for something other than meat, too!

I wanted to be blown away by Miss Ada. I was mentally drafting a five star review as soon as I sat down, actually more like days before I even got here. I thoroughly stalked Miss Ada's menu, pictures, reviews, and website several times prior to my visit, as I do with many other hot restaurants generating buzz around town. I know, get a life, weirdo. But really, I even knew basically exactly what I was going to order by the time I was finally able to score a weekend reservation. My dreams and sky high expectations were simply not met.

First item I decided I had to try was the whipped ricotta. Although I did get a couple of perfect, satisfying bites worth savoring, I was left wishing the honey would have been drizzled on more generously or mixed into the entire dip - once you exhaust the top layer, this dish is really not all that exciting.

The item I was looking forward to the most was the chicken liver and caramelized onion hummus - that description alone just screamed of flavor to me, but alas, the flavor was just not quite there. So much so, that I actually committed the ultimate faux pas, the equivalent of a slap to a chef's face - that's right, I dared asked for salt, which helped slightly, but not enough to give it the wow factor I expected.

As for the kofta kabob, I did appreciate the beautiful plating and the innovative use of cinnamon bark as the skewer, but looks alone will only got you so far in this world, sweetie. The meat itself lacked flavor and was honestly quite boring. Not the best use of my $13.

Lastly, I indulged in the snapper crudo, one of that day's specials. This was by far the most flavorful dish, thanks to the lemony sauce loaded with fresh jalapeños and dill. At this point, I was way too grateful for the almost overwhelming acidity and flavor that other dishes were missing.

Now look, nothing I ate at Miss Ada was terrible, nothing was even bad, but nothing lit up my palette with fireworks either. The above mentioned four dishes were also way too much food for my boyfriend and I to split, despite our waitress raising her eyebrow at us and claiming that was going to be light order. However, for a restaurant with such a cult following and high demand, I once again do not see what all the fuss is about. I am not afraid to revolt against the masses and say it - much ado about nothing here at Miss Ada.

Food was delicious. We got a table in their garden, which is a super nice space. Got the baba, lamb shwarma, octopus, and hangar steak, all which were delicious. I was very impressed by the steak, which we ordered after reading some other reviews.

The only downside was that they really really wanted us to leave in our designated window, even though we were seated late. They mention a few times on their menu that we only have 90 mins, the server mentioned this at the beginning and tried constantly to take our order within 5-10 minutes of sitting down. They also came up to us ~15 mins before our 90 min window finished and suddenly came up to us and asked "how would you like to pay, with one credit or two?" even before we were done with our meal or saw/brought the check! I get it - times are extremely tough and they need to keep a steady turnover. But it took a little away from the experience to feel so rushed.

I really enjoyed this, particularly the dips -- the sweet potato, baba, muhammara, and whipped ricotta were all amazing. I was less crazy about the beets and fava bean hummus (although I'd like to give the lamb schwarma hummus a shot). We also got the octopus, half brick chicken, a special steak skewer, and falafel, and the only one of those that we really liked was the octopus.

Next time, those first few dips are must re-orders, and I'd like to explore the hummus a bit more.

Came here without reservations on a Friday night. The wait was 40 minutes so we decided to sit at the bar.

We ordered 2 cocktails, an appetizer (the spicy hummus) and each had the salmon with eggplant as an entree.

The hummus came out before the drinks did and it was really good, probably the highlight of our meal.

20 minutes later and still no drinks (the bartender was slammed and there didn't seem to be a bar-back helping him).

Our entrees arrived and we were disappointed to see the $27 per-plate salmon alongside just two-bite-size pieces of eggplant and the remaining plate supplemented with roasted onions (which honestly didn't compliment the flavors of the salmon whatsoever, so I'm wondering if they were out of eggplants and just threw in the cheapest veggie they had on hand)?

Our drinks finally arrived when we were about halfway done with our meal (womp womp).

We finished with the chocolate brownie with ice cream which was good but nothing to be impressed about.

Unfortunately our experience was lackluster and I don't expect we'll be back, despite living only a few blocks down.

I live very close and never knew this place was there! It's easy to walk right by if you don't know to look.

There is seating indoors and a really cute patio out back. I suggest eating out there if the weather is nice.

My boyfriend and I walked in on a Sunday evening and there was no wait.

All of their wines are natural. And they even had a gamay on the wine list!

Everything we ordered was amazing! We had the whipped ricotta, lamb shawarma hummus, brick chicken and za'atar crusted salmon. I'm still thinking about the warm pita bread they served surf the ricotta and hummus.

I 100% recommend this place!

Miss Ada could've easily been a 5-star meal if not for a few slip ups. We came in on a Saturday night and it was pretty crowded. We ordered the lamb hummus and baba ganoush to start and both were absolutely perfect. I would love to come back just for those two dishes. However, they came out within five minutes of us ordering. Like, I went to the bathroom and by the time I came back they were already out. Fine, but the meal's cadence continued to be off.

The busser took our empty plates away and we got our next course immediately, a halloumi skewer and a short rib skewer. These were also really good but we were starting to get super full since it was 15 minutes into the meal and they had already served us almost everything.

Our final course was the falafel and the kale salad, both of which were sub-par in all of our opinions. When I bit into the falafel I could literally only taste cilantro, which I hate and it wasn't advertised on the menu. I couldn't eat it. Both of my friends do like cilantro, though, and said it wasn't very good anyway. The kale salad was WAY overdressed with huge stalks of raw broccoli that were almost impossible to eat. It had tons of raw onion in it, also not stated on the menu, which always ruins any dish for me. So unnecessarily sharp tasting and overpowers every dish. At the very least it should've been on the menu so I could've asked for the salad without it.

After finishing this last course we were about a half-hour into the meal and waited 20 minutes for the check. I don't mind waiting but why rush everything in the beginning only to forget about us in the end? Finally the waitress came by and gave us our check - no mention of dessert. We saw their dessert menu online and were excited to order from it but it was obvious our time was up (50 minutes after arriving) and there would be no sweet end to the meal.

I still would come back but would likely just stick to the small plates which were absolutely delicious.

We've been multiple times for dinner and recently went for brunch. Really fantastic meals each time.

The High Notes:
- MUST order the whipped ricotta with honey. Do not question this. Just do it.
- Babaganoush dip is also wonderful and a nice way to balance the sweet whipped ricotta
- Pita is great and plentiful, we're often pretty full from two dips and pita alone
- The variety of kebabs haven't let us down yet
- Very cute spot with a nice garden in the back
- Fair price for what you get in flavor, satiety, and environment

Other Notes:
- There is a separate section on the patio that is pretty cramped, right in the sun, and the plants are all over you depending on your seat. Just don't grab this table on a hot day and you're golden.
- The food comes out SO fast. Which can be great if you are starving, but I usually appreciate a little spacing to enjoy the experience a bit more. Meals feel a bit rushed here.

Get a reservation if you can, but if you can't they do try to take walk-ins and so far we've been lucky and were seated almost right away.

Will keep coming back, excited to try more of the menu!

Came here for a brunch with a group of friends and was impressed by the quality of dishes that came out. I think the lamb shawarma was definitely the best of the bunch and a must order!

Only complaint is that the dishes didn't come out together and we got some of our spreads towards the end of the meal.

Absolutely blown away by the service here. The best I have ever experienced in a restaurant, laid back but attentive and warm. The food was perfect from the appetizers down to dessert. This restaurant was a joy to dine at!  I loved the fried cauliflower, falafel, labne,  baba ganoush and babka P. S. I hope you're tipping over 20% if you eat out during a pandemic.
