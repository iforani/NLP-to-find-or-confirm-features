This place was fantastic before COVID and, happy to say, it's still maintaining the quality. It also felt very safe: Well-distanced tables, mask-wearing by all the staff, and QR code for the menu.

Our party of two visited on a quiet Wed night. We were seated immediately in the outdoor space. We ordered the hummus app and 2 small plates (octopus and burrata), along with splitting a main (the pork chop). The food was all excellent!  The hummus had a nice lemon-y bite, the octopus was a well flavored and composed dish, and the burrata with figs was creamy, slightly sweet and delicious!  One of the best things about this place is the fresh baked bread - so good, we polished off 3 portions w the app and small plates!

The pork chop was so juicy with a delicious and aromatic crust. I would come back to Boutros for this dish alone!

Excellent meal, great service. I'm glad to see a local spot still going strong in these strange times.

A spot that hasn't really drawn me in, but happily went today for call in pick up. Chicken is solid (the garlicky sauce on top was the highlight, but the bulgur fried rice and kale salad were some of the best things I've gotten during Pause. Kale salad comes with all the components split out. Prices are def moderate for the 'hood, too. Glad I went!

One of my favourite spots in Brooklyn-I remember peering in when they were setting up to open a few years ago. Have been a few times over the last 3/4 years and have never been disappointed.

Went the other night, and had an incredible meal outside. The tables are far apart and at the moment they are only offering outdoor dining. We split a load of smaller dishes-fried rice, brussel sprouts, calamari, labneh and burrata. I couldn't tell you which was one was my favourite. It was such a good combination of flavours and freshness.

Cannot recommend enough!

Ordered takeout from Boutros recently and I was blown away by the food! Their pita is AMAZING

Burrata-the figs complemented the cheese well, but I think the pita bread really stole the show. It was so incredibly fluffy, definitely the best pita I've ever eaten in my life

Grilled octopus-the octopus itself was tender but it was a bit too charred. The mashed potatoes were very good but I thought the dollops of what tasted like Frank's hot sauce a bit out of place

Maitake mushroom-the mushrooms were roasted well and I loved the sauce, though I wish the sauce was able to penetrate down to the stems

Braised lamb shoulder-perfectly tender and I liked the pomegranate seed garnish

Happy to support a local business during these weird times.

Boutros is a very cool restaurant on Atlantic, and for our first date night without the puppy since lockdown, we decided to give it a shot!

Small plates were super nice but varied in quality. Pita was fresh out of the oven and blistered to perfection. Burrata was clearly from the fridge and lacked its trademark elasticity. Babaganoush was smooth with miso and was super interesting. Hummus was as expected, hit it with the lemon from the za'atar calamari which would have been a star if delivered to our table hot. The concept of all the dishes was A+.

The roasted half chicken as an entre was phenomenal - kind of like a middle eastern chimichuri. Moist and cut well. Awesome.

Knaffe for desert was prepared to order. Delicate and not too sweet. Very well done. Drinks were poured nicely and drank the same after a stir.

Tables outside were comfortably spaced, people were respectful, service was attentive but not overbearing.

In all, we paid for a very nice experience and a great concept restaurant. Although execution of some small plates this time was off, I look forward to these folks being at full strength. Thanks for a lovely evening! We will be back.

All of the food here is so good! It's a little pricey, but the food is really flavorful and creative. I love ordering the labne, a few skewers, and some of the veggie appetizers. I have also had the steak and chicken entrees and both were delicious. Definitely one of my favorite neighborhood spots!

I was looking forward to having dinner here - I had heard so many good things about it. But perhaps the night I decided to come in - it wasn't to sharp!

We ordered the  hummus as an appetizer and it took forever to get to us only to realize, after our entre came in, that the waitress had forgotten about it (or she misunderstood as she later mentioned). For entres we ordered the fish and the Skewers. My beef skewers (two cubes per skewer - wish it was at least 3) were a bit fatty. My girlfriend's fish was tiny and the base sauce under it was super salty...the price we paid for both meals wasn't on the easy side - I would comfortably say their prices are too high for their food.

The actual interior design of restaurant is exquisite! Has an industrial look with many warm touches - fell in love with the spot - very beautiful and trendy. Great atmosphere!

Downtown Brooklyn's Middle Eastern/ American fusion restaurant. Great location for a marriage of where culture meets food.
Boutros is located next the famous Damascus Bakery and Sahadi gourmet market. The famous Atlantic Ave location is great for walking off such a delicious meal. We shared a lot of appetizers and saved room for dessert.
Worth a second a visit for Brunch. Try to get a seat with a view of the kitchen at the chefs table. Exotic cocktails, wine and beer and don't forget after dinner drink of Lebanese liquor Arak.

Came here for brunch and nervously ordered the Avocado Toast, worried that my $20 would go towards some measly bread crumbs and watered down green mush -- I was delighted to have my worries proved unnecessary!

SUCH GOOD AVO TOAST !!  Each slice was spread with generous amounts of avocado mixed in with the legume/bean-based trimmings.  My favorite part of the dish was the crispy chickpeas!  In general, really impressed with how this savory, vegetarian breakfast option was both refreshing and filling.

My friends ordered Challah French Toast and Shakshuka.  Loved the CFT as a sweet option, and as someone who doesn't usually like sweets, the ricotta and pistachio provided excellent balance against the syrup.  If I were to rank the three dishes, I'd say 1. Avo Toast, 2. CFT, and 3. Shakshuka -- but all were wonderful!

You can see their New American-Middle Eastern fusion in their interior design, earthy industrial with a beautiful mosaic tile floor.  Lots of dark wood, black iron, slate, and moss/lichen.  We spent some time trying to figure out if the roped, light fixtures were solely for aesthetic or were also functional (turns out, also functional - how lovely!)  Not at all busy on a Saturday morning for what a gem of a place this is!

Came here for brunch and had the best meal! They have the absolute cutest decor and the fluffiest pita bread I've ever eaten!

We ordered the burrata cheese dip with fig and fresh baked pita bread which was amazing and then I had the French toast which might be the best French toast I've had.

The staff is nice and it wasn't super crowded but glad to have made reservations. For the two of us with an app, cocktails and an entree each, after tax and tip we paid $100 total.

The food is top notch flavored and that is a big deal because Arabs don't normally expect  to  be blown away at other Arab restaurants because we all prioritize home cooking-- but this place takes the cake! Everything was so perfectly seasoned and cooked. Amazing decor. We loved everything  we got, including all the skewers and the burrata appetizer & the mushroom (which was my favorite).

We only hope that the restaraunt will grow to include more of a Levantine wines selection!

Having spent the morning searching for a new apartment in Brooklyn Heights, we decided to dine at Boutros for brunch and explore the surrounding neighborhood.

The restaurant is modern and well decorated, service is solid, and the vibe is incredibly laid-back.  I'm not sure if this is a Brooklyn-specific thing or whether I've become too comfortable with the idea that people are just rude and that's NYC for ya?!

We ordered the Shakshuka (with poaches eggs, parsley, and house baked pita) and the Halloumi and Spinach Frittata (served with mixed greens and multigrain toast).  For the price point, the portion sizes were generous.  I do regret ordering the Shakshuka for brunch though - way too much pita for one sitting (that's my bad).  It was delicious!  Maybe it's good for sharing?  And absolutely no complaints about that gigantic Frittata!  Yum!

We really enjoyed our meal and look forward to visiting this restaurant again!

Solid, clean Mediterranean food. I ordered duck breast, which comes with some sort of grain, sour cherries and fava. The skin and meat were perfect, really nothing bad to say about the dish at all!

I also tried the pork belly skewer appetizer and beignets for dessert. Both were fine, but not standout. In particular I wish the beignets came with the sauce in a ramekin for easy dipping and were a bit more fluffy.

I topped off the lot with one of their signature cocktails, the "Thistle & Smoke" made with Mezcal, Cynar, honey and citrus. It was well-balanced and would make a great summer evening cocktail.

In terms of ambiance I enjoyed the dark wood vibe with industrial touches. The chairs were comfortable. There's a large community table in the center back of the restaurant, so if it's busy you'll probably be knocking elbows with your neighbors. But it was quiet at 9 on a Thursday.

Finally, fantastic service! I was well-taken care of and enjoyed my visit.

Some of the best food I've had in Brooklyn. A bold statement.... but I really can't get over the grilled octopus, the pork belly and the brussel sprouts. Pure heaven.

The pork belly was my favorite dish of the night. Just the right amount of crispiness on the outside, and tender and juicy on the inside. The glaze that formed over it with the hint of grill flavor completely blew me away. The octopus was amazing as well. Not too chewy and unbelievable flavors, plus the potato purée underneath was a really good touch. The brussel sprouts.... some of the best I've ever had, and that's saying a lot with brussel sprouts taking over every menu out there right now. The sauce/glaze was amazing, and the sliced almonds gave it a nice crunch. Also, make sure you get a mezze plate so you can try the pita... you won't be disappointed by either (I recommend the beet hummus)!

The dishes are pretty pricey for the portion size, but they are so spectacular it makes it a little better. The cocktails were really good. Not as strong as I prefer, but very solid flavor combinations. I loved the Thistle & Smoke.

Definitely a good spot for an intimate date night or catching up with a friend.

Boutros has expanded their hours -  Cafe hours Mon-Fri 8am - 3pm and they open again for dinner at 5:30 as previous.
During Cafe hours they serve coffees and delicious house made baked goods and a small lunch-ish menu of pita sandwiches  and skewers
The beef one we had today was cooked to order and delicious.
Highly recommend. Not just for dinner any more :)

Thrillingly good ! That is what we told chef/owner Allan Dabagh after our first meal last night.
Why did we wait so long to come, we asked ourselves.
The food is superb, new American with some interesting accents showing the chefs Lebanese & Syrian roots.
Last nights appetizer special was SO good, it was titled Spring Peas, Hummus, Black Garlic
& Green Almonds. Dani, our very pleasant server, recommended the combination of the Spring Pea salad and the roasted lamb chops with beets and zaatar.  The hummus in the Spring Pea & Snap Pea salad was made with peas, it was unique and outstandingly fresh & delicious.
Everything was on a very high level from the cocktails to the dessert. We will be making many return visits. Chef Allan's commitment to his first restaurant is thorough. He designed the space himself and was working on construction on a daily basis. The room has a really nice feeling that has to be experienced. Also a communal table as well as a handsome bar with a beautiful moss and wood that Allan created himself, lit beautifully and fronted with the wonderful ambers of whisky bottles.
This deserves to be a neighbourhood staple and a destination restaurant for many years to come.

Amazing evening at Boutros. My first time. Great people, great service, fabulous food. The grilled octopus and roasted chicken were out of this world. And don't leave without trying their hot tea... great finish. The owner Allen was personally attentive to all and leads a delightful team.

Atlantic ave has come a long way since the late 90s. Boutros fits in nicely with a Mediterranean/Middle Eastern/New American mix and a strong chef that pairs quality ingredients and excellent flavors with stylized presentation.

The design of the restaurant is gorgeous and inviting. Generous amount of single strung Edison bulbs hang from the ceiling and give off a gentle hue that feels intimate. I do wish the sound levels were better attenuated as it can get loud and a bit hard to hear without yelling slightly. I also would have preferred a more comfortable chair and a place to hang a coat (since the chair design doesn't allow it to be hung across the back effectively). Do yourself a favor and get creative with a custom off-menu drink. They have some housemade sodas that beg for a kick. We had a pineapple punch with rum and Ginger lemonade with vodka.

But don't let some of these minor flaws obfuscate the great cuisine. We started with some mezze of Lennard crostini which was just the right amount for 4 and had a wonderful texture and flavors. Following up as apps we went for the kale tabouleh salad, mozzarella pizza and bulgur fried rice. Skip the pizza but must get bulgur & kale (PRO TIP: Mix the rice & kale for a treat).

I opted for the fish which was a perfectly cooked halibut on a light bed of bok choy in a light sauce (which also works with the bulgur fried rice). My wife ordered the steak that came out exactly medium rare with a nice char on the outside.

We didn't have room for dessert but felt that our whole meal was excellent. Service was solid, if a little inefficient (didn't take multiple refill drink orders when one of us ordered). Water was constantly filled and a well appointed bathroom make for a fine dining experience. We'll be coming back for sure. Also noticed they're on Seamless now too!

Quintessential Lebanese restaurant! Exceptional food, wonderful space and friendly service. It's clearly a neighborhood go-to. When you walk in the space is warm and inviting and it seems as though everyone knows each other. The first few minutes you feel like an outsider and then the staff puts you at east and starts treating you like a regular.

Chef Allen Dabagh displays the welcoming demeanor that the Lebanese are known for. Clearly, he's never met a stranger. It seems all the guests in the restaurant on Wednesday night were his friends or family. And the food! Oh, the food!

Sitting at the chef's counter was like being in my grandmother's kitchen - if my grandmother had attended the French Culinary Institute. Mezze is my favorite way to eat. Small plates, spread over time. Different textures, flavors, and temperatures - it's food for my ADHD brain! The menu starts with traditional Lebanese foundations: hummus, skewers, halloumi labneh, tahini, and then brings different modifiers (e.g. peas or beets in the hummus) and spices (sumac, dukkah, za'atar) blending them in creative ways. The results are lively and delicious. New twists on ancient food.

My only regret is that Allen was not serving Kibbeh Nayeh the night we went. His take on Lebanese steak tartare includes bulgur, puffed amaranth, sunflower seeds, and spring onion! And it's served with homemade pita hot from the oven. Sounds like heaven!

Ah Boutros... Saturday night dinner with my mate. My first impression is the restaurant was warm and inviting- nice ambiance. But...

They sat us under a speaker and proceeded to blast 90's soft-core, gangsta rap, heavy on the bass, for the duration of our meal. I mean, come'on... none of you listened to 90's gangsta rap back in the actual 90's back when I would've appreciated a deep bass line. I'm old now, so all that bass was annoying to me all night long. But I guess it's fair... I annoyed plenty of people with the same music back in the 90's...

Anywho... the annoying music aside, I had a really special chicken entree here. I mean it was absolutely delicious and memorable in every way. The rest of our food was tasty (including a sorta sweet pork dish), but not as memorable.

All-in-all, I'd say what I most remember about that night was the bass of the music, the amazing chicken dish, and paying way too much for other, less memorable, dishes.

But opinions vary. You might still wanna try this one if you're in the neighborhood.

Really beautiful, cozy restaurant. Love the ambience of this place. The food is pretty delicious as well. We ordered a mozzarella and tomato pizza to share as a starter. It was very good and more than we could finish. For mains, I ordered the duck with freekeh, fava bean, sour cherry and coffee. Wow, this dish was really amazing! The duck was so tender and juicy and all of the elements of the dish worked really well together, despite the oddness of their combination. Portion wasn't huge, but it was enough for me.

The only quibble I have with this place is due to a slight misunderstanding. During our starter, we decided to eat only half the pizza and take back the rest to save room for the entrees. We were kept waiting quite a long time, until we finally had to ask the server where our entrees were. Turns out that he had been waiting for us to finish the pizza before bringing them out. My preference is usually to have the server check up on us at some point, but I suppose flagging him down would have been appropriate this time. It happens, I guess.

This review is for bunch only. Strangely, they opened thirty minutes after the opening time listed on Google or Yelp...it seemed like they weren't quite ready for customers (who were already gathering and waiting outside the door), which was a bit odd. When they did finally open the doors, we really enjoyed ourselves, though.

Fun music, gorgeous space, and delicious food. Absolute BEST thing we tried was the avocado toast. One of the best I've had. Avocado mixed with tahini and served with a runny egg and crisped chickpeas. We also liked the shakshuka. The halloumi scramble was less exciting but the potatoes served with it were outstanding - so crispy and awesome. Prices are steep but I will definitely be back to try dinner some time!!

My review right now won't do justice. This place has amazing food. Like, beyond next level of contemporary heaven on a plate type of quality. I will say this....BEST octopus I've ever had. Period. And a nice portion size which is rare with octopus. The edemame humus also a nice touch. Since it was our anniversary(good date spot for sure), they have us a free puff pasty dessert. It was equally insane goodness. I will definitely update my review as I remember AND go back to try everything. One of the best places to eat in the area for sure. Well done.

One thing I'll never complain about is the explosion of new trendy and upscale restaurants opening up in the neighborhood. I'd been following Boutros' Instagram for a while (since before they opened) and finally made my way there for dinner.

The space is as gorgeous as advertised. It wasn't a restaurant before, which is even more impressive. The bartender told us it was actually an ice cream shop decades ago, and they kept the floor tiling. There are cool lightbulbs hanging from strings, and tons of awesome cooking/cocktail books lining the shelves. There's also a big mossy thing on the wall behind the bar and in the bathroom.

Anyway, the entrees range from $18 to $31, but I recommend doing a bunch of starters to share and a pizza if you're just 2-3 people.

We did the foie gras fritters, grilled octopus, smoked halloumi, and the clam pizza.

You'd think deep frying foie gras wouldn't work, but it does. I especially loved the strawberry sauce that it was set on top of.

The octopus was cooked perfectly - tender and not at all rubbery. Could've gone for a little more char though. The red pepper chutney was a great complement.

The grilled halloumi was basically a sizable arugula salad with watermelon. The halloumi was hidden underneath and the whole dish was a nice contrast of flavors.

The clam pizza was pretty damn good as well. The crust was airy, and the clams were plentiful. It's not quite a New Haven crust, but it's probably one of the better clam pizzas in the area (which is no small feat since there are a TON of pizzerias nearby).

Their beer selection was respectable, and they have a hell of a wine list. Service was great, and I'm looking forward to coming back for brunch!

Having recently attended an amazing Yelp Elite event at the restaurant,  I booked a brunch for me and a friend this past weekend.

My friend enjoyed her Shakshuka, and I thoroughly enjoyed my avocado toast with poached egg.  The egg is not really necessary though (an upsell item at $3 extra), as the dish with its fried garbanzo and stewed fava beans, provide plenty of protein.  Unless you really love beautifully poached eggs.  The dishes are nothing fancy, just very tasty, filling, and comforting.  The coffee was delish as well.

Service was pleasant as well - one of the standout elements of this place.  Definitely merits a return visit in the near future.

I vowed to come back for this foi gras fritters and I did just that. It was amazing. I think my favorite dish is the mushroom dish, and the octopus. I can't get that sweet tahini out of my mind. I also had the duck again, and I tried the beef and broccoli dish that was amazing. The beef was very tender. The broccoli and sauce was spicy and sweet at the same time.  We were treated to a new dessert on the menu a halvah chocolate / ice cream dish, that was truly delicious. I am more of a light dessert kinda gal, (but I love halvah) but for those must have chocolate after dinner types, a great choice.

The service was impeccable. Nobody rushed us. We sat and sipped hibiscus tea afterwards and a great time was had.

I likey!

We started with cocktails, I had the ginger which was very acidic, and gingery, and very strong just the way I like it. The Labneh crostini, was very tasty. A bit thicker than the typical crostini, I think it was served on focaccia bread, but it lended well to the tart flavors of the labneh. We wanted to order the fois gras fritters, but unfortunately they were out of it (and the pea dish).

The bulgar rice was really extraordinary. I rarely eat grains at restaurants. If I'd work nearby I'd buy just the rice for lunch.

The duck was delicious . The cook was on point, and I really enjoyed the cherry sauce.

I hate to admit that the pork was a little bit disappointing. It was a bit dry, and just not as special as I was expecting from the restaurant. Every dish we had was shared, and after we each had a bite, we sent it back, but paid for it. :/ I'm not always sure what to expect when the dish isn't up to par, but whatevs.

The mushroom dish was aaaamazing! I love love that sweet tahini sauce that I stole a potato from the pork dish and swiped some of that tahini.

The strawberry knafeh was refreshing and interesting. It was a great end to a great meal.

I will certainly dine there again. Please have some fois gras fritters and peas waiting.

Wow! What a gem this place is. The interior is very modern and welcoming. The staff is genuine and friendly. You get a feeling of being at somebody's home as opposed to just any restaurant yet in a modern setting. I absolutely love this place. And the food...oh the food. You're in a mood for something interesting? Possibly tasting history and influence of different countries? Then this is the place. Their cocktails are also very unique. Definitely check this place out. It's one of a kind

It's fitting that Chef Allen Dabagh opened his first restaurant on this stretch of Atlantic. The Middle Eastern flavors from his heritage blended with New American cookery is a perfect representation of the amazing (if bougie) neighborhoods of Cobble Hill and Brooklyn Heights, bisected by a street that gives us Sahadi's, Damascus Bakery and more.

The space itself is beautiful. From the living wall behind the bar, to the chef's counter where you can watch the efficient expediting of everything you're about to eat, there isn't a bad seat in the house.

The menu is divided into appetizers, vegetables, pizzas, and mains. I've yet to try the pizza (although the crust looked superb as one walked by, and the za'atar sprinkled bread they bake fresh for each table speaks to the quality of that 760 degree oven), but every other section sports at least a few winners.

Among the starters, the fluke crudo had heat and balance, in addition to being easy on the eyes. The foie gras fritters are foie gras fritters (can't be bad), and although I would've liked a bit more of the soujouk (think Middle Eastern chorizo), the bulgur fried rice was tasty as well. That last dish seems out of place as a starter; it's a large portion and it doesn't feel like an appetizer. With more soujouk added and a fried egg on top (as opposed to scrambled and mixed in as it is) it would make it a perfect dish to start your day (I believe it's on the menu of their recently launched brunch, so there's that). In fact, since we ordered too much, I took it home and did just that, and it was phenomenal.

The mains are well-cooked, well-balanced, and tied together by incredible sauce work. The brown sauce with the beef is something I could just drink as my meal, and the caramel that comes with the pork chop ties the entire dish together. I appreciate the way the flavors are layered as well; the perfectly tender beef arrives with both charred stalks of broccoli, and also a broccoli puree. The effect is stunning, and it's my favorite dish thus far.

Similarly (and shockingly), the peas were the most memorable aspect of our most recent meal. With charred whole peas, pea pods, and a puree on the sides, it all came together with the green almonds added in a final flourish, and it made me so happy that it (1) tasted amazing and (2) shows that vegetables aren't an afterthought at all.

All in all, an excellent addition to the neighborhood, and I plan to keep coming back.

Came before seeing a movie around the corner. The first thing that struck me was the cocktail list. I literally couldn't decide because they all looked fantastic. Ordered the 'Bitter Tree' and it was fantastic!

My wife and I opted to order an assortment of small plates, and each was delicious. We got the miso baba, the grilled octopus, the bulger fried rice, roasted cauliflower and 2 skewers (pork belly and chicken). Everything was wonderful, and it was the perfect amount of food for us.

Very recommend!

A fine brunch. Nothing was as revelatory as had been advertised, but a fine place for brunch.

Jordan the bartender is reason to come here alone! The drinks are very good however they're pretty expensive... But the ambience is really really cool. I love the living wall that you can just stare at for hours while just having a drink. I came here on a Thursday evening and was very well attended to, and very well taken care of, even though I was only ordering drinks and didn't get anything to eat. The people next to me ordered flatbread pizza, and it looked so good! I wish I would've ordered dinner. When I come back to Brooklyn Heights, I will for sure order something off of their food menu. This place is quiet enough to have a conversation, but lively enough that you don't get bored. It would be good for any kind of mixed drinks, cocktails, beer, or wine.

I wasn't able to score a spot to the yelp elite event here a few months back, but the pictures looked so good I knew I had to make it out here.
Boutros is definitely a special occasion kind of place both in price and atmosphere. The service is very attentive and the staff is very knowledgeable about the food and drink.
With regards to the food it was interesting, in a good way. The night started off with a Mezcal mixed drink. A bit oaky and citrusy, this hit the spot. The Zaatar house made roll was amazing but I would have appreciated one per person instead of just one to split. I could have had at least three just by myself.
We started off with the fois gras fritters and this was really the only miss of the night. The fritters were perfectly fried but liquid on the inside. I've never had fois gras in liquid form and it was just a weird texture for me. Another appetizer the squash baba ganoush was excellent. Perfectly spiced it was a great vegetarian treat.
For my main dish I ordered the pork chop and it was the best pork chop I have ever had! Grilled to perfection it was juicy and flavorful. The fingerling potatoes and grilled pears complemented it perfectly.
The hubby had the ravioli with Lardo. I liked his dish because I have a sweet spot for lardo or anything like it, but my pork chop was still my favorite of the two.

For dessert we had the halva chocolate bar. Good but a bit forgettable.

Overall we had a really nice time. The ambiance was trendy in a laid back way and the lighting is perfect for a date or a get together with friends.

Came here for dinner and it happened to be happy hour. Cocktails were 9$. I got 2 ginger gimlets and they were delicious and visually appealing. My bf and I split the half chicken and the bulgur fried rice. Both were absolutely divine. The food is clearly great quality and full of flavor. Worth the $$$. For dessert we shared the grape and strawberry sorbet. Again, very delicious, and a great dessert to clear the palate. We will definitely come again. I am looking forward to trying their brunch.

We dropped in to Boutros one night for dinner and drinks, and we are so happy we did! We sat at the bar and ordered cocktails, small plates, and skewers to share. The ambiance, service, drinks and food were all excellent. The grilled octopus was particularly good. The bartenders were friendly and you can really tell when the staff is passionate and proud of the product they are putting out.

Our only regret was not sitting at the "chefs table" style seating in the back, which we didn't notice right away.

I had had one of those days, that happens once in a decade: EVERYTHING went pear shaped, capped by a spectacular wipeout on a slippery sidewalk grate.
I decided I deserved a drink. So stopped in a lovely little restaurant in my neighborhood.
The bartender was wonderful, the cocktail was lovely. I looked a wee bit bedraggled... not my normal, glammed up self: wasn't filming my show that night. The nice hostess was eying me a wee bit askance, but I kept texting with Courtney Love and perusing the menu.
Ordered a drink, then decided to have something with "nestle sauce". Now, usually stinging plants are t my thing, but I figured "well, must be safe" and went ahead.
Took a few bites while absentmindedly texting away.. then realized PAIN OUCH TONGUE OUCH NOOOO!

Nettles are not your friend. Unless they've been boiled for at least five minutes. Felt like razor blades. NOT FUN.

The owner came over, and took the accusatory stance that people who open restaurants but haven't brushed up on customer service, do. "We served 40 people thisfish today, and nobody else complained! said Mr. Owner.
Well, bully for those fifty folks. My mouth and throat hurt like fiddledeedee.

Asked how they were cooked.
He mimed lowering nettles into boiling water (not great at customer service, but epic at mime), and taking them out again.
"The chef blanches them", he said impatiently.
Ahhh! As someone with UK roots, I have cooked nettles. They MUST be boiled. For five minutes plus. I mentioned this. Unsurprisingly, I was again oooh poohed. I shut my silly female mouth, and they comped the nettles.
Not my drinks, which, while not necessary, would have made me less grumpy.

So.. 28 bucks for two small cocktails,
One sore mouth and throat. 10 minutes being scolded.

What a FAAABULOUS experience!
Not.

Lots of other good (and much cheaper!!) restaurants in the neighborhood.

UPDATE: The owner answered below, and demonstrates yet again his amazing flair for customer relations. Calling me a liar, saying I used "Yelp" as a threat, and using my politeness against me.. what a great way to handle this! How gracious and kind.
The customer is not only always wrong here- the customer is a liar.
Maybe that explains all your other one and two star reviews? Perhaps only crazy liars eat here.
Not to worry: the words "not twice", apply.

Well played, you.

UPDATE: Once again, the owner is playing "Blame The Customer". You just don't get it, do you. Calling me names, insulting me, implying I'm a liar: I still paid 28 bucks, to have my throat and mouth hurt, due to your negligence.
I was bullied by you, so I was more polite than I felt, so I could leave fast. You have an arrogant and threatening presence. As your rude and arrogant response, below, proves.
If you are going to call me a liar, what about all the other one and two star reviews here? Are they all liars?
Next time I will it's go to the ER and sue you. That's what I should have done earlier.
As for my going to Yelp? You have a restaurant that charges money for an experience. I had a shitty experience at your restaurant. Deal with it, rather than insulting me.
If you can't stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.
If you want to apologize,I'm here. But you don't apologize, do you?

Interesting decor. They like moss.

Lebneh appetizer was good. The bread was great, the lebneh was nice and tart, the seeds and veg they put on there added a nice texture.

The ginger cocktail is really good. The red citrus cocktail was middling. The caramelized pineapple cocktail, which I had high hopes for, tasted reminiscent (and somewhat resembled) dip spit. Y'all should really fix that.

The halloumi in the hash and the raclette on the nduja sandwich were hardly discernible, which is a shame because I love halloumi. I didn't really get the flavor or texture from it at all. The nduja sandwich was pretty decent. The avocado and fried chick pea toast was really good, but I feel like it's hard to mess up avocado toast.

Service was prompt and friendly.
