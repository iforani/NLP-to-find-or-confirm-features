Bit the bullet and after a long duration of home cooked food, ordered from Fragole this evening. Well worth it--a very delicious and satisfying meal.
Granted, I've had their food in the past but somehow writing a review slipped through the cracks.

Fortunately, there are many choices of restaurants in Carroll Gardens that, due to Covid-19, offer curbside pick up or delivery.
Fragole, with its  solid reputation, allowed us to feel comfortable to order delivery knowing they're taking precaution in the kitchen and with the handling of food.

The following was on tap as far as the order:

Appetizer:
*Polenta with mushrooms in a Fontina cheese sauce. I would probably declare myself as not being a huge polenta lover but this appetizer would convert anyone. Finely ground polenta smothered with mushrooms in a creamy and rich cheese sauce. Extraordinarily delicious.
*Grilled Calamari served with arugula salad. A perfect, healthy balance to the Polenta appetizer. Nicely seasoned, grilled to perfection and accompanied by a tangy baby arugula salad. This appetizer is a must try.

Mains:
*Chicken parm with a side of spaghetti. Although I did not try this dish, I was told it was light, airy, not oily and incredibly delicious. The cutlet was large and accompanied by a generous amount of spaghetti, grated cheese and side bread. A solid and satisfying portion.
*Grilled Salmon prepared with white wine caper sauce and served with sides of saut√©ed spinach and mashed potatoes. I love seafood--a lot. Typically, salmon is not my first choice. However, I have been craving seafood during this entire lock down period.  I was also confident that Fragole's salmon would be a good choice. And it certainly was. The salmon was cooked to perfection (medium), flavorful and well seasoned, while the spinach and potatoes turned out to be the perfect  comfort food accompaniments. Overall wow factor. Both selections were very generous in terms of  portion size.

Fragole is a popular neighborhood spot all year long. With life in the midst of a new (but hopefully temporary) normal, it is good to know that old reliable establishments, such as Fragole, are around to help us get through it all.
Excellent!

Yall! This place is delicious and the gnocchi is definitely the BEST I've ever had. It's so tender!

Victor, our server, was super gregarious and brought a complimentary tiramisu for my friend's birthday:) since it's the time of covid, they are of course, all wearing masks.

Will definitely return for that gnocchi!!!

This has been my go to spot for high quality amazing experiences.  Even during the pandemic they are open and helping the community.  Their pappardelle con ragu di carne is my go to take out now.  I look forward to dining there once we all get through these difficult times.  Super nice and friendly staff.  Please check them out if you haven't yet.  They are listing their daily specials listed on their web site.

The polenta is just WOW
We ordered the polenta and calamari (which was surprisingly grilled) and black linguini, papardelle with ragu and mushroom risotto for entrees.

So glad we found this gem. Food is superb. Staff are courteous and efficient. Such a cute neighborhood too!

I had a previously bad experience with this restaurant because of the issues with the Caviar/ DoorDash customer service. I would like to give a fair review and say that the food is actually delicious. I had the chicken milanese and the rigatoni bolognese for take out and both were amazing. My husband inhaled the leftovers and enjoyed it.  I tried the chocolate lava cake and it was tasty, I prefer less cocoa powder though. I would love to go try the food in person at the restaurant than deal with the delivery apps as timing requires patience.

I do look forward to coming in person when the indoor dining resumes in NYC.

Fragole is my favorite restaurant! I happened to stumble across it in 2016 while looking for Italian food and what a great find!  The service is fast and efficient and the entire staff are extremely friendly. You feel at home as soon as you walk in.

Both owners, Viktor and Claudio, are absolutely amazing! Viktor has the best personality and so much energy!
Claudio is so friendly, warm and welcoming. They are both very generous and accommodating.
Olivia is so sweet and attentive.

The food is absolutely outstanding! High quality, freshly homemade every day! What more can you ask for?
My favorite is the Rigatoni Bolognese! The pasta is cooked to perfection and the sauce is the best I have ever had. But whatever you order, I promise you will not be disappointed! (We have tried most of the menu)

My husband and I went to Fragole at least once a week for date night (when we still lived in NYC).  We loved Fragole so much we even had our baby shower there and could not have been happier!!

Everything at Fragole is perfect!!

(Please open a restaurant in California! We miss you so much)      :)

If you're looking for a cozy, authentic, friendly Italian restaurant that always has quality cuisine you'll be very pleased with Fragole. From the dim lighting, perfectly crusted bread with herbed EVOO, to the rustic charm of the tables and cloth napkins you'll score points with a date (or even a discerning wife and kids). No hassle getting a table and prompt, but not rushing, service can allow you to pace yourself easily.

If you haven't gone overboard with their homemade bread and oil, treat yourself to some Bruschetta to start. For mains, check out some of their pastas for no-brainer scrumptiousness. We often go for the melt-in-your-mouth Rigatoni Bolognese, the Rigatoni with eggplant, the Gnocchi Sorrentina or the house-made Parpadelle con ragu (the ragu has braised short-rib in it). All of the portioning is "just-right" and won't make you regret finishing your meal (you won't have leftovers either). If you save room for dessert, try their Tiramisu, which is classic and delicate.

One thing to keep in mind is they do not have a full bar (only wine and beer); however a nice selection that can keep you satisfied with your meal and relaxed atmosphere.  Stop by Fragole to be transported back to the old country (or even old Carroll Gardens) for a consistent, memorable and yummy meal.

Lovely restaurant and staff with reasonable prices. I went with a small group. I would skip the short rib pappardelle  (it was okay, but the least favorite of the table) and go for the squid ink pasta or one of their specials and a lava cake.

My husband and I decided to have a spontaneous date night and had heard great things about Fragole so decided to check it out. We were able to get a table for an early dinner. Service was friendly and prompt. We shared bruschetta and the Spaghetti al Pastore and they were both fresh and delicious! Very impressed by the flavors in the spaghetti. Their sidewalk dining space is lovely. I hope to be able to experience their dining room sometime so

I thought that I was going to love this place and I just didn't. Things started out well with the appetizers but took a turn when we got our entrees. For apps we started with french onion soup and the beef carpaccio. The soup was great and from what I was told the carpaccio was good but we both agreed that neither one of is enjoyed our entrees. We order the Pappardelle con ragu di carne (ragu w/ honey braised short rib) and the rigatoni firenze (rigatoni w/ eggplant, tomato, basil and mozzarella.) now sure all of that sounds mouth watering but it was not as good as it sounded. Flavors were off and just lacking. Im regard to wine I tried a few dark reds and ended up settling on something that I wasn't even too thrilled with. Overall I wouldn't have been so disappointed if the appetizers sucked and the entrees were great but not liking my entree is a hard pass for me! Won't be returning.

First off let me say that the staff here is beyond amazing! As soon as you walk in, you feel extremely welcome! I had the pleasure of meeting Viktor, who is one of the owners, and he has one of the best personalities that I have ever met. So humble! And always so happy! Constantly had a smile on his face and his energy was contagious.

Now on to the food!

Pancakes- Some might not be aware of my undying love for pancakes!! These were pretty darn good!
The edges were nice and toasty which made it extra yummy!
They came topped with strawberries stuffed with a lemon cream that was so tasty! And a strawberry sauce that was delicious! I'm usually not a fan of fruity sauces on my pancakes but Fragole nailed it! No complaints!

Cheeseburger was very good!! Tasted super fresh! Didn't come with ketchup but it didn't even need any! The only reason I noticed that it didn't have any was because I saw someone else putting some on! (The ketchup comes on the side by the way, apparently I was too focused on the food to notice the huge tin with ketchup for you to apply on your own) haha!
Oh! And the fries were delicious!! Golden, crispy, and tasty!

Polenta was also yummy! It came with some bolognese sauce (yum!) and a runny egg! This is only my second time trying polenta so I'm no polenta expert, but this one definitely gets two thumbs up!

Rigatoni alla bolognese- This is a must try!
Not only is it super picture worthy, it's also super tasty!! The pasta was cooked perfectly, the meat sauce was delicious! You cannot go wrong!

Tiramisu!- This is another absolute MUST! I always say that it's hard to find a good tiramisu but this one exceeded all expectations! Probably my favorite out of everything that I ate (which isn't surprising because I have a pretty serious sweet tooth). But please save some room for this dessert, you'd be doing yourself a disservice if you didn't have it! So even if you're too stuffed, order it anyway! (There's always room for dessert anyway)

Even the cappuccino from here was delicious!
And almost forgot to mention the delicious warm bread that they serve for the table !

Everything at Fragole was perfect!
A+ all around.
Above and beyond service, people who actually care about their customers, and delicious food, now that's a rare find!
Definitely looking forward to my next visits! : )

We have been on a pasta binge these past few weeks, and Fragole (which means strawberry in Italian) was an excellent stop on the list. First of all, I love anywhere you get bread to start with. Not only did we get bread, but also tomato sauce to dip it in - loved! We got the bruschetta where the bread was crispy and the tomatoes delicious, followed by the rigatoni Firenze and string beans on the side. I cannot say enough good things about these dishes. The string beans were garlicky and tasty, and the rigatoni had an abundance of sauce (which I appreciate - nothing worse than not enough sauce) as well as cheese and eggplant.

The molten chocolate cake was also delicious. Our server was nice and funny. He gave us a little champagne at the end because we didn't order drinks with dinner (due to too many drinks the night before, which he got a kick out of). We thoroughly enjoyed our meal here and will be returning for sure!

I recently had dinner here for the first time. The ravioli with pink truffle sauce was unbelievably flavorful. It's situated in a cute area, and the outdoor seating in front is perfect for enjoying a glass of delicious wine, tasty food and people watching on a Saturday evening. I will definitely be back.

Came here for a second time after the owner/manager offered a retry. While the service was slightly better the food was still nothing amazing. I got the squid ink pasta, which I normally love, but this time it tasted like it was soaked in fish and was completely inedible. The manager however was nice enough to make me a new plain pasta to take home. He said they had to order the pasta from a different vendor that day and it's not usually that fishy but again, that's what I was given. I still wouldn't go back but the customer service was good.

Both the food and service were lacking here. I came here for dinner last night for the first time. We got the salad special of the day which was shaved Brussels sprouts, mango, strawberry and some other things, the esotica salad, rigatoni Firenze, orecchiette, and the risotto dish of the day which had sundried tomatoes and artichokes. The Brussels sprouts salad had no flavor at all. It was so bland I couldn't eat it. The esotica salad was better. I did not like the orecchiette, they must use fennel in their sausage because that was all I tasted. My mother enjoyed it though. The risotto was blah my aunt didn't even finish it. I had the rigatoni and it was so salty I could barely eat it. The service was also not great. No one came to ask if we were ok, if we needed anything, if we wanted another drink. Nothing. We waited 15+ minutes (after waiting so long I started counting, it was probably closer to 25-30) before having to ask for our food to be taken away and for the check. Not the best dining experience over all

Cute place in Carroll Gardens. Small but intimate environment. Perfect for business outings, a date or for a quick bite with the family. We made reservations for Friday. The place was busy but wasn't too packed.

We ordered the calamari appetizer, the black linguine and the pappardelle ragu. The calamari was excellent. Grilled and lightly marinated. The pappardelle was amazing. It was the perfect combination of thick creamy and hearty. I thought the black linguine was a bit salty for my taste.

Overall, great place to dine. The wait staff were super friendly and accommodating. Our water glasses never went empty. Food came out moderately fast. Only downside is they don't have an extensive wine menu or an alcohol menu at all yet but it's in the works. Unfortunately we sat next to three young children who were very loud which isn't the restaurants fault but still slightly annoying.

5/20/2018Thank you for your nice feedback Jane.  Did you know all our pastas are homemade, and made fresh every day?  I will discuss with the kitchen you comment on the black linguine, and be easier on the salt.  We hope to get the licence some time soon and so we can gain the 5th star from you.

Had a great dinner with my friend who was visiting from abroad. This was my first time visiting after seeing so many delicious pictures all over Instagram. This spot was recommended to me if I'm trying to have a cozy dinner and an inviting atmosphere. The staff were all amazing and helped us pick some incredible dishes from the menu. Would definitely come back again and maybe for brunch!

But I would surely recommend this restaurant if you're trying to go have a relaxing dinner with soothing atmosph

I came here on a Saturday evening for dinner and everything was amazing. The place is super cute and the food is so yummy.

To start, I had the bruschetta and a kale salad with apples, walnuts, pancetta. Honestly one of the best salads I've ever had!

I got the carbonara and my friend got the ink squid pasta. Both were super fresh and so good! Their portion sizes are also not too big and not too small. We ended the meal with a tiramisu that was sooo good. Can't wait to go back!

A super cozy restaurant with a home-y vibe. The staff really ensures that you are taken care of during your meal. The menu is packed with a variety of everything you'd expect from an authentic Italian restaurant. Obviously, my favorite here is the rigatoni bolognese. The presentation is unlike any other - as they stack the pasta precisely into a pyramid. (then you just knock it down to devour it) The sauce is super flavorful!

Would definitely recommend if you are in the area!

This is my favourite Italian restaurant in Downtown Brooklyn with a pasta dish that I'm convinced has crack in it, it is that good.

Fragole is fairly new and if you were looking for an Italian restaurant in the Court St area, I so very recommend this place. The owner is hands on and takes so much pride in his restaurant. The vibe is rustic and homely, welcoming you like an Italian grandma.

I have many a favorite dish here but the one I truly love, the one I get multiple times, the one I can eat seconds and thirds of is the Rigatoni Bolognese. There is something inside that just gives me all kinds of feels in my mouth I cannot describe it, you must try it for yourself.

But if I were honest, every dish I've tried here has been phenomenal. A hidden gem would be exactly what I'd describe Fragole as. I do recommend their brunch menu too. Both, the sweet and savory options have been lovely.

The prices are fair and if you're driving, there are metered spots right outside. Mmmm, now I'm hungry for some pasta.

I personally didn't find much wrong here (except their wine list--need more wine! LOL). The restaurant is small and quaint and on a quiet block, I think it would be easy to miss unless you lived in this area or was told about it.

I ordered a glass of red and was happy that the red they offer is a Montepulciano (my favorite Italian red). Went with a friend and split the Antipasto Vegetariano which was pretty tasty and was a pretty large portion. You can definitely split this among at least 3 people. I had the Orecchiette Barese (shell pasta, broccoli rabe, and sweet Italian sausage). Very flavorful but by the time this arrived I was a little stuffed from the veggie plate and their bread bombs, so I wound up taking a portion home. It was flavorful and cooked perfect.

The highlight of the evening (aside from the wine) was their tiramisu dessert. Probably one of the best tiramisu's I've had in a while. Perfectly fluffy cake to coffee liqueur and cream ratio. I wound up finding a small pocket of space in my stomach to house the entire thing clean off the plate.

Friend was unhappy with her meal and the owner wound up having the kitchen cook her an entirely brand new pasta dish which I found very nice.

I'm not from this area and it's kind of a PITA to get to Brooklyn from where I am, so I can't say I'll become a regular, but would definitely have this on an option list if I ever was back.

Super delicious Italian food! New Yorkers are spoiled for choice when it comes to good Italian food, but where I live, the Italian places that people rave about are mediocre at best, so I don't eat Italian food often.

This place was definitely a treat for my taste buds, from the appetizer, to the mains, to dessert. I ordered both my appetizer and main off the specials menu, and ate everything on my plate. Then I shared a dessert with my husband, but wished I had ordered my own.

For an appetizer, I ordered the Asparagus Wrapped w/ Prosciutto. Asparagus is my favorite vegetable and Prosciutto my favorite cured meat. It was served with some mixed greens, balsamic and parmesan. The flavor combinations were perfect. My husband had the Beef Carpaccio, which I tried and it was a solid version, but my appetizer was so much better.

For my main, I got a Risotto w/ Artichokes (my other favorite vegetable), Sun-Dried Tomatoes and Chicken in a Pesto Sauce. They were very generous will all the toppings, which is much better than having a plate full off rice and sauce.

Dessert was a Chocolate Cake. It was nice an moist, and a great way to end a perfect meal.

They did not have a liquor license when we dined here, which was not an issue for us as we were running in a 1/2 Marathon the next day, but we did see more takeout orders than dine in patrons. This was great for us from a service perspective. It is a small restaurant, so I imaging that it could get very busy.

Everyone at Fragole loves to hear from customers like you (Elite Yelpers)  Thanks for spending your night before the half marathon with us, but don't let a carb fueling occasion be the only reason to visit us!  BTW, we use top notch grass fed filet mignon to make the carpaccio, so we are so happy to hear your husband loved it.
Hope to see you soon!

Food is consistently good and the rolls are delicious. I wish they had a healthier chicken item on their main menu since when they have a chicken dish as a special it's usually very good.

Stopped in for lunch with a friend. I'm a new vegetarian so was excited that they had some nice options. My friend ordered wine. They only have two options, House Pinot Grigio and House Chianti (which was a bummer). The bread was cold and hard. The pasta, however, was delicious. I got the Rigatoni Frienze and it was amazing! The tomato sauce and mozzarella were super fresh and the rigatoni was the perfect al dente. I would definitely come back for the pasta!

In times past, Carroll Gardens had a huge Italian resident, and even though the neighborhood has changed, the quality of Italian food has not.

I've always thought Little Italy would be the go to for Italian food because of the "Little Italy" and because I grew up around the neighborhood, but after finding this cozy spot, how I was so wrong to think that!

Made reservations for a Friday night, because I've learned in the past that Carroll Garden's restaurants are always packed during the weekend and have waits up to 3 HOURS!!! Can you beleeedddddd that!?

The place is extra cozy and definitely represents family and you can definitely get the feel from the decor. It's nothing fancy or extravagant like you would find in Manhattan, and it definitely should stay that way. It was quiet early, but filled up fast! Make sure to make reservations ahead of time!

The service was good! Waiters & Waitresses were accommodating. Despite being understaffed, they really were able to pull it off! Kudos to you guys for your service!

And the best part, the FOOD! I haven't had such good Italian food in along time! I order the Black Linguini, and it was delicious! Even though I was pretty hungry by the time I got there, that dish really hit the spot! I couldn't be happier! My friend had the Papparedelle Ragu, and it didn't disappoint at all!

I would definitely come back for the food! I definitely want to explore the rest of their menu!

Fragole, expect me back very soon!

We've been meaning to stop by Fragole for years and finally decided to try it tonight for delivery, which is not usually the best way to try a place for the first time. But I must say, it by far exceeded my expectations. Not knocking any restaurant, especially during these unusual times. But ordering in during the pandemic has been a little sad, most delivery has been a little underwhelming. But our dinner tonight, was beautifully packaged, prepared and arrived quickly. (I wanted to take photos, but I couldn't wait to eat it, so I didn't). The food was nicely assembled in their container and all accouterments were included without having to ask. We started with the rustico salad, it was really beautiful and all the toppings were so delicious, as was the dressing. As the mains, we shared the lasagna which was excellent. The sauce tasted so fresh with a nice touch of basil and the overall texture was light. We also had the ragu with the homemade pappardelle, which was tasty. We ordered the broccoli rabe as a side which came with a lemon wedge, the broccoli rabe deliciously balance out the meal. This meal was really a treat. I definitely plan to order from them again in the next week or two and would love to stop into the restaurant once things get a little closer to normal.

Came in for lunch and didn't see a big selection in the area. However, this little Italian gem stood out. The bread and sauce served before the meal was warm and crisp! I didn't know what the sauce was but it was amazing. For lunch, I had the rigatoni bolognese. It was cooked to perfection and just the right portion for the right price.

Guyssss! This is the BEST restaurant ever!!! Must must must try!!!

We're celebrating our mom's bday and looking for a place that caters for party of 9. The catering menu is fantastically well priced with so much variety and you get so much good and fresh food with huge portions!

The owner, Claudio, is super friendly and easy going! He made sure that all the dishes come with the best fresh taste and gorgeous presentation!

Food is fantastic, fresh with huge portions. The "Grilled calamari salad", "Hangar steak", "Grilled Salmon", "fettuccine with mushroom cream", "Black spicy linguini shrimp" and the special house-made "tiramisu cake" ARE TO DIE FOR - literally!

Thanks so much for the amazing experience! We loved everything!

The food is excellent, the atmosphere is cozy and the service great. We ordered lasagna for our company holiday party here 2 years ago. It was such a hit everyone asked us to do it again so we did. The owners are great, super hardworking and a true American success story. It's a neighborhood staple. I also order out from here often too.

Fragole is unfailingly consistent in serving wonderful food, warm and attentive service, and in pouring good wine at great values. Victor is a marvelous host.

I thought Fragole was very good. The wine selection was quite limited and a bit pricey ($35 for a bottle of cheap Pinot Grigio) but the selection of food was great. I ordered the Tilapia piccata served over spicy broccoli rabe-very delectable.

This was one of the best Italian meals I've had in a long time. My friend and I started with the bruschetta and cavolo nero salad, which were both delicious. But the cavolo nero especially was one of the best salads I've ever had. The tuscan kale along with the apple slices and Caesar dressing melts in your mouth. Then we got the carbonara and squid ink shrimp pasta. Both were absolutely delicious and very filling. We ended with the tiramisu for dessert and it was delectable.

The service was outstanding the entire time. I can't recommend this place enough!
