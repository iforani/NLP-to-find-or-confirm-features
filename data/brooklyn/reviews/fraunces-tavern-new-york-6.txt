I have been spending some time in Battery Park cat sitting for a friend who is stuck on the West Coast for the pandemic.

Fraunces has been a staple for me. The food is exceptional, the whiskey option more so. The staff is topnotch as is the efforts to maintain safe distencing for their diners.

A must have is the pretzel and sliders - a great combo.

What is the catch? Well, to be honest - the house band on the weekends. I can't begrudge a band for giving it their all - but they are not the main attraction - they are background music. We would be much better off if your amps when up to 4 ... and not eleven.

We made a reservation for a Saturday night and I'm glad we did! It was busy. Overall we had a good experience, though we did feel like they could have done a better job with social distancing....

My partner enjoyed his salmon sandwich and I enjoyed my lobster mac + cheese. His hot apple cider was delicious! I tried a pumpkin beer the server recommended and was very happy.

I'm so glad that this restaurant is still open during COVID.  The food and the service are great.  The outside seating allows you to appreciate the beautiful 18th century building. I highly recommend Fraunces Tavern.

We found this spot while walking around the financial district in NYC and we are glad we did.
Service was good. Food came out quick and the hostess/waitress was friendly.
Food was great. We decided to go seasonal with the Oktoberfest menu. We had the Roasted Pork Confit Sandwich and The Bavarian Sausage Plate and we had a side of parmesan truffle fries.
The atmosphere was nice. The building itself was beautiful and is also a museum.
Drinks were good. We kept the oktoberfest theme and got a brooklyn kinda dry cidre and southern tier pumking
Price wasn't horrible for a NYC restaurant.  2 entrees 1 side and 3 beers for $86.
Would definitely go back to try some other seasonal foods there as well as the regular menu!

Visiting New York my mother in law recommended this place because it has good for and also a museum above it.

So first the museum was pretty big, it had wide variety stuff from flags to dinnerware and to get in its not super expensive.

The staff was pretty friendly and informative about everything. Pretty clean place too, I had no complaints. Now for the food, I was pleasantly surprised at how good the food was. This place has the best scotch egg that I've ever had.

Everyone else was really happy with their food as well.

Overall, it's a pretty cool place, located in the financial district,  all this history around you and inside the restaurant as well makes for an amazing atmosphere. Plus the food is really good. I would recommend this to any one who's going to New York for a vacation. Well worth stopping in for lunch or dinner.

Located not too far away from Battery Park, this historic pub offers a good selection of craft beers and food. Although they were out of many beers on the menu, the ones we did end up ordering were great. We also ordered a flatbread which was loaded with cheese and arugula and went really well with the wine. The server highly recommended the fish and chips - I didn't find the fish extraordinary but I still enjoyed it. The fries were pretty good though! The live music while dining outdoors, surrounded by the FiDi skyscrapers added to the tavern's appeal overall. Would recommend this place for a Friday or Saturday night dinner and drinks.

Came here for drinks and dinner and was blown away. The outdoor seating space on a weekend was great. Lots of seating available, very attentive service, and live music. The drink selection was excellent and price was pretty fair for this part of town. The highlight of the evening was the chicken pot pie, which came out steaming hot. It was a great sized portion, and tasted amazing. Unlike most pot pies, this wasn't too heavy and I didn't feel like taking a nap immediately afterwards. I highly recommend this place and that pot pie!

Pretty okay spot. I had their fish and fries and my husband had a burger at the restaurant. We sat outside, their staff was very friendly and wore masks at all time. The seating outside were socially distant as well.

A lot of history in this bar. Fraunces Tavern is one of the oldest in the United States. It's been the gathering place of many important figures through the years. Expensive for everything. The place seems to always be quiet at lunch.

Check out some of the history online before you come. It has a long history. There's many stories that can be told. It has been here since around the colonial days. They have been many famous people. George Washington liked coming here. The drinks nowadays have become super expensive, even for just a beer, including all the big brand ones. It's about $9 for a beer. The food is the same way. It's not much of a problem for me because there's not that much vegetarian friendly. This has a lot of common Irish pub stuff.

I would come again for the history. It has its own museum. That's better use of your money in my opinion.

Since its purchase and remodel in 2011, the new owners of Frances Tavern have done a good job of respecting this incredibly important and historic building.  With the addition of the museum and private dining rooms upstairs and the 'modern era' bar, there is the Tallmadge room. With its oak panelling, old world furnishings and high-18th century windows, this is one of the oldest rooms in the building and the heart of the Tavern.  This is where you can eat a meal where revolutionaries once dined, over two-hundred years ago.

Once we were seated, we noticed more locals/regulars dining here than tourists.  We saw several 'after work' dinners and gatherings going on, as well as some couples enjoying a slighty-romantic dinner.  The Tallmadge room caters to a variety of occasions. (It's always a good sign when the locals are regulars).

Proper dining at places like this (Historic tourist spots) can be difficult.
Some are in it to stick-it to the customer with pre-wrapped and frozen meals and steep prices.  The Tallmadge Room at the Tavern is a proper restaurant and does not fit into that category.   One of the highlights of the meal is  The Steak On A Stone - the signature dish here at the tavern. Complete with dirty rice with cherry tomatoes & pearled onions and three different dipping sauces- Dijon, chimichurri and soy. If you like your meat medium rare, pull your steak off the stone as soon as you get it, or it will cook very fast and go beyond your desired temperature.  A great dish,  nicely conceived and displayed.  Also great was the Berkshire Pork Chop, with Crispy onions, Parsnip Pur√©e and apple Bourbon Sauce.   They also had  a good selection of wine to choose from.  A fine meal all the way around.

Also good was the service.  The staff was attentive, efficient and always visible.  We were thoroughly satisfied. On our particular visit, the server taking care of us was from a foreign land and not American.  A graduate who was working here to help them get to the next stage of their pursuit.  We had a great time talking to them about where they came from and where they wanted to go.  It was nicely fitting to see the pursuit of the  American dream working so well at Francis Tavern.  I think George Washington today would enjoy the food and drink, as well as the staff and the service.
I'm in town 1-2 times a year and there are a couple of places I will always visit.  While most of my business is in mid-town, I think Francis Tavern has made the list of must-stops, when in NYC.  "Four-Thumbs Up" for me!

What a delightful establishment!  George Washington frequented this place and dismissed the Continental Army after the Revolutionary War from this building.

The food was delicious, but not hot enough.  I had the lamb stew.  It was overflowing with meat. The sauce was tasty but a bit thin.  The menu said it was served with bread but they were out of bread.  It sounds bad, but it was delicious.

While I ate, a local band played and it was perfect for the atmosphere.

Came here for happy hour- there were a lot of reserved seats so I'm not sure where people should sit if you didn't make a reservation. It is kind of dark in there as well but historic.

Drinks are the usual price- it was 15 bucks for an old fashioned. I didn't see any specials. The bar was full but not super packed. Older crowd. Right by the whitehall stations- R and W

Decent beer, but forced us to purchase an appetizer and made sure to state that fries din't count just to get us to pay $18 for an app (cheapest option was $15). Came for a couple drinks left with a hefty bill.

We love places with historical ties. Open since 1762, Fraunces Tavern served as a headquarters for George Washington during the American Revolution! The last time we came here was a couple years ago, but we wanted a place to grab a quick bite before jumping on the nearby Staten Island Ferry so coming here was a no brainer.

We arrived around 6 p.m. and noticed it was happy hour (4 p.m. to 7 p.m.) so we decided to try some things from that menu. We started with a couple refreshing and tasty Smuttynose IPAs and a dozen Happy Hour Oysters (priced at 6/$9). We also ordered their Roasted Garlic Hand Cut Fries from the regular menu.

Everything was fresh and delicious but I noted that there were only 11 oysters on our plate instead of the dozen that I ordered. After bringing out another oyster to us, we asked for the check because we were in a hurry and realized they charged us their regular prices instead of happy hour prices. They kindly changed the check to the correct amount.

When we have more time, I'd like to get back here and try their Tapas menu which looks to have many yummy offerings and reminds me of a recent trip to Spain. But when I do, I will take a second look at the bill before I leave.

Really cool historic restaurant, bar, museum, cocktail lounge.  All different areas for these 4 options.  Located in the downtown financial district near water street.  It was built in 1719, and became the most popular place in the area for drinks and food back in the day.  It is charming, exceptionally decorated (feels as historic as it is).  Great drink options, happy hour specials, oysters, full menu, full service restaurant, cute sitting area for quiet cocktails in between the bar and restaurant. I didn't visit the museum since I was there with colleagues and we had a tight schedule.  If you are history buff, this is a great place to check out.

This place was really fun. I went here for lunch during the week. The bar wasn't too busy, and it was super easy to find a seat. There is a sign that says "2 drink minimum." But I spoke to a few regulars, and they informed me that this wasn't enforced. Everyone sitting around me ordered a few drinks though.

I checked out their webpage before I walked here. It stated there was a "seafood soup of the day." I got excited about this and planned to order it. However, when I got here, the bartender informed me that the webpage was outdated and they didn't have a seafood soup.

I ordered the butternut squash soup, although it was pretty warm outside. It was tasty and I enjoyed it. I definitely would order this again and maybe try one of their entrees next time, as well.

I'll definitely be back here! It was sort of difficult to find the bar though. This restaurant has a lot of hallways and seems sort of like a maze. I needed the hostess to point me around the restaurant to show me the way.

This place is outstanding, great food, great ambiance, and lots of history. The building's foundation and frame makes it the oldest building in NYC. Yes, its been renovated numerous times but lots of it remains as it was several centuries ago. Without getting too much into its history, which includes a farewell dinner party for George Washington and his army, I will emphasize on the amazing food.

They serve British style pub food, as well as modern gastro pub fare. Lobster mac and cheese, Scottish eggs, fish and chips, raw oysters, are among the delicious old school Great Britain inspired pub cuisine. Everything on their menu is of high quality and freshness. This is not just a restaurant/museum that serves mediocre food. It's a place that takes its food seriously and provides consistent quality, as well as rare pre-colonial dishes that you can't just find anywhere anymore.

I came here to try the popular winter cocktail called the Spiked Hot Apple Cider. The cider is served hot and it is definitely spiked. The bartender immediately accommodated me and best time to go is on an early weekday after 5 but before 6pm. I was able to get a seat and got my cocktail almost immediately. The cocktail is made up of: George Dickel No.1 white corn whiskey with turmeric, ginger, maple syrup, orange juice and spices. Well, definitely I tasted all those ingredients. They also have a variety of draft beers from Porterhouse Brewing Company, which are very popular. Highly recommended cocktail plus you get access to see the museum and tavern where George Washington the 1st US president had his farewell party after leaving the presidency. However I would do research on the admission to the museum because they may have discounts on certain days, I know they have discounts for federal holidays.

I have had their food previously not this time around. Food was pricey. I had the chicken pot pie, which was George Washington's favorite dish. The quantity of food matched the price but the quality was not memorable.

Place is great for drinks especially if you like beers and ciders.

This tavern was an amazing place. It was full of history and had so much uniqueness about it. It has a huge whiskey list and the servers are able to tell you about the types in depth. They were extremely friendly and proud of their establishment. They even had live entertainment there. It look like they had a great menu. I ordered the lobster Mac off of it and was very impressed. I saw the burgers at the table next to us and they are going to be my next choice when I go back to New York and visit this place.

I love this restaurant ! The slow roasted chicken is outstanding, service is always friendly and fast. I have eaten here after finishing the Great Saunter which I've completed twice. With all the people coming into the restaurant I'm always amazed at how wonderful the staff handles everything. I know with Covid they are trying to operate outside. I hope this place makes it. Such history here and great food too!

Came in with a group of friends for a late dinner. Theres is great selection of drinks and food. It's a bit pricey and the food is mostly pub food, but it is done well.

The ambiance of the restaurant is great since it has that old American historical feel. It doubles as a museum, but appears very welcoming as a place to sit and drink.

Obviously the history is what makes the tavern a destination but the food is hardly an afterthought.

I seriously regret not taking a photo of my mom's filet mignon the other day -- it's one of the more generous sized portions of it that I've seen and served atop a hot lava stone that continues cooking the steak (brought out rare) to your liking. It's accompanied by three really, really good dipping sauces -- a mustard, balsamic-ish steak sauce, and chimichurri. Hard to pick a favorite.

My dad and I went with the lobster mac and cheese which was also exceptional and loaded with hunks of claw meat.

Ask to sit in the Porterhouse! It's the more funky and less stuffy side of the building. There's also an even more casual lil bar area towards the back that's great for just grabbing a beer.

Came here two summers ago, ordered the Fish and Chips, wow, a fresh and abundant portion. The ambiance and traditional food made the experience so worth the trip. The history of the building is evident, and the dark wood and industrial lighting make it a great place for lunch.

Landmark restaurant and bar in NYC. Established in 1762 with a museum upstairs.

Food and service are excellent. Dinner Portions are big and shareable. Prices are reasonable for downtown NYC.

We tried the bacon wrapped shrimp, grilled octopus to start and had diablo seafood, churrasco steak with chorizos, lamb shank (special) and Branzino.

I loved my pimm's summer cup and it was delightful mixed drink.
For whiskey lovers, there is a lovely whiskey bar seating area (not sure if reservations are required) with a lot of choices.
Wine and Beer enthusiasts can find ample choices as well.

I suggest you Go check it out for yourself.

Yes, perfect food and perfect service.

Normally, as a born and bred New Yorker, descended from the first founders of New Amsterdam, I avoid anyplace with tourists, but the Tavern is too good to miss out on.

The tourists are well mannered and very respectful of the environment, and the almost holiness of being able to eat and drink where Patriots said goodbye to General George Washington.

This is really, "Old School"!

This place makes a truly delicious and expertly-cooked Impossible Burger (easily made vegan by omitting the cheese). Huge props for that! Other great things: 1) one of the best and most frequently-rotating beer selections in the whole city  & 2) live jazz!
I'm not usually interested in "historic" restaurants, but Fraunces Tavern really impresses me and is worth visiting. Despite its historic standing, it really doesn't feel too touristy at all - there's always a good mix of locals and visitors.
My only request: add even more vegan options! :)

It was 3pm on a Saturday and I was starving. I just so happened to search yelp for brunch locations close to where I was staying in NYC. This popped up and seemed like a warm, welcoming, historic spot to brunch. I'm so very glad I did! The atmosphere is friendly, the wait staff is AMAZING! I clumsily dropped my fork and knife on the floor and someone was there with new cutlery in less than a second. Water glasses were always filled without asking. Even better... they had a live jazz band playing. I fell in love! I'm so very happy I decided to pop in. Tips: ask for a table away from the door. The restaurant is cozy, but the doors open frequently and cold air blowing in gives you quite a chill.

It's a beautiful and historic spot with an amazing atmosphere and an evolving seasonal menu. But on a not that busy night, the service was somewhat clunky to non-existent.

I and 2 colleagues ordered the charcuterie board, letting the server decide what options we should get based on customer favorites. It was fine but pretty uninspired. Store bought quality at best.

As for my steak? In all of my years eating meat, I've never had my steak sliced before it arrived at the table. All of the juices poured out on to the plate, and frustratingly the steak was served fat side towards me so the first bite was a bit gnarly. I asked if I could swap out the potatoes for cauliflower or another veg also on the menu and was told no.

Food was fine, but without a doubt, this is not a destination.

We were very happy to find this place. It's beautiful inside, and on a late Saturday afternoon, the live jazz band inside was a treat. We rested our weary toes and started with a round of drinks. They seem to have a big team of servers assigned for different tasks.

I'm not much of a drinker, so I opted for a water. And for an early dinner, we decided to share several appetizers.  I loved my watermelon salad with feta and thick, generous slices of heirloom tomatoes. Whatever that citrus salad dressing was, it was divine.

We did have a problem with one order though. It was an appetizer that came in different flavors. My friends ordered one flavor, but when the dish arrived, it didn't look or taste like they expected. When questioning the server, she wordlessly picked up the dish and disappeared.  About 10 minutes later, she returned with the same dish, slammed it back down on the table (now it was cold) and said, "The kitchen says the order is correct." And just walked off.

So now we were left with a cold dish. She didn't ask if we wanted to order something different if we weren't happy with it. She didn't offer to replace it with a fresh hot order. In fact, we couldn't find her again until we had to chase someone down to ask for the check.

So in case anyone was wondering, that's how you don't get a tip in a restaurant.

This place has it all-- especially if you love history!  Located in the Wall Street District, you will find many fine things in the area.  This Tavern is one of the best in the area.  Great food, live music, wonderful happy hour specials and a superb wait staff make it something very special.

A little pricey menu but it is NYC and the food was well worth it.  Between the three of us we had the chicken pot pie, fish and chips, and eggs Benedict.  All was excellent.  The service was even better.  The waiter made great recommendations and made us feel quite at home.

Take a few minutes to look around while you are waiting in your food.  The ambience is wonderful.  Visit the museum upstairs before/after.  It is well worth the $7 admission.  Also, take a stroll around the neighborhood.  There is so much to see regarding the original New York and lots of interesting old buildings to look at.   Look ahead at the website to find when live music and happy hour specials are happening.  However, a weekend brunch is also perfect.

Actually, very surprised this place is not more of a tourist attraction on travel sites.  I am so glad I visited!!

Came here for a happy hour. Pretty cool place. It is steeped in history, but we all know we're here for the food so let me get into it.

$1 meatballs - only comes in orders of 6. Amazing and delicious. Would highly recommend.
$1 oysters - did not get because not a huge fan of oysters, but good to know for the oyster lovers out there. Also only comes in orders of 6.
$6 beers - There are only 2 beers that are $6. The rest are regular price so beware of that. It's not the best deal.

Also tried to chicken pot pie which was extremely good. The cream was a little reminiscent of New England Clam Chowder because of how rich and delicious it was.

The short rib sliders were also extremely delicious. They have these caramelized onions that are perfectly sweet and compliment the short ribs perfectly.

We also had a scotch egg, which was amazing, but it was also $15 for a single egg. I don't know if I would ever pay that much again. In general the food here is extremely expensive. Even the meatballs were a bit on the small side. The music here is not memorable but the vibes are good and service is decent. I would come come back here for a special occasion but this isn't a place i would frequent on the regular. I'm not made of money bro.

It's hard to say something original in a yelp post about a place this historic and with this many reviews. I greatly enjoy the atmosphere, but find their system of only serving some of the beers they have depending on when other beers run out archaic and confusing.

Great spot! This was fun for a Friday night. Good food with an extensive drink menu too. There's something here to please everyone. It has a very cozy feel to it. We enjoyed the chicken liver pate, the bacon Mac and cheese and the Parmesan truffle fries. The Max and cheese reheats well too.

Generally speaking, I like historic places and Fraunces Tavern is THE oldest building in New York City.  The building actually dates back to the Revolutionary War and if you have enough time to take a tour of the place, please do so.  One thing that should be addressed before you go is to make sure that you get accurate directions before you go.  I actually asked several people AND had my GPS and passed by the place quite a few times before I actually arrived at my destination.  The "Pearl" street sign is basically nonexistent.

Since I arrived at the restaurant prior to the rest of my dining party and I was starving, I decided to order their meatballs and a drink while I waited.  I must admit that the service at Fraunces Tavern is wonderful and I couldn't have been treated better as person sitting by myself and waiting for others. (It's been my personal experience, that when I have been alone, I have been completely ignored until someone else showed up.  Like as a single woman, I didn't exist until more people arrived.)  So kudos on the service, however, the meatballs were lacking.  The actual taste of the sauce was good, but the meatballs themselves weren't tender.  I don't think that there was enough binder added to them and that made them tough.

Once the rest of the party showed up, we proceeded to order the "Traditional Fish and Chips (Beer battered cod and mushy peas), Slow Roasted Chicken Pot Pie, The Churrasco platter with Skirt Steak, spicy Chorizo sausage and roasted plantains and the Organic Salmon Pappardelle. (I wanted to order the Berkshire Pork Porterhouse Chop with Fuji apples and celeriac puree, but they were out of that and the Branzino.  Sigh! )  We also ordered the Hand-cut Fries with Truffle & Parmesan.  The Chicken Pot Pie was scrumptious and what you want in that type of dish... A warm, flavorful hug!  My daughter and sister enjoyed the Fish and Chips and my friend DD enjoyed the Salmon Pappardelle.  I don't know if I was jaded after eating from everyone's plate, but I just found my Churrasco platter to be okay.  Nothing bad, but nothing spectacular either.  I also think that I was really disappointed that I couldn't order the Berkshire Porterhouse chop. (I actually looked at the menu ahead of time and I had my heart set on devouring that.)

So, the question is, would I return to this restaurant?  The answer is honestly that NYC has so many amazing restaurants, that I had my moment here already.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone that loves/likes historical buildings and restaurants.  However, there's nothing really drawing me back again personally and I can try other restaurants that I've been trying to get to.

We decided to be tourists for the day and found ourselves at Fraunces Tavern in the rain. There are tons of different rooms, and I wonder how the experiences might differ. We were at the bar in the central room, and it was relatively quiet at 4:00 on a Tuesday. Bartender was efficient and made a recommendation for whiskey. I didn't love her recommendation, but also didn't tell her that, so that's on me. Large tap list, but it just depends where they are in the list in terms of what you get. Overall, another touristy spot downtown, although it felt nice to get it with a bit of history. A fine place if you need somewhere to stop in, but I probably wouldn't make it my destination.

We literally stumbled upon this unbelievably cool spot. Such a fun place to have a beer and just admire the history of this watering hole.
We stopped in before happy hour and the place was a little busy. It's dark and warm inside. We sat at the bar and were in amazed by their beer list. 140 beers either on draft, can or bottle. If you're whiskey fanatic, they carry some impressive brands.
Our bartender was so spot on with his recommendations (beer and whiskey).
We ordered their whole chicken wings which were large and delicious! Each piece had a wing and drumstick...
Their prices are very reasonable for the area.
Take a walk around and admire the history. From my understanding there is even a small museum.
Definitely a stop in for a friendly chat and a craft beer. ENJOY!

Don't have anything bad to say about this place. We came here for happy hour and had a very happy time!

Love that the building has so much history to it and the interior was very cool and cozy. Service was very slow at first with the english accent waiter but he left and it was a lady that was tending to us and she was very fast and efficient.

Don't believe the happy hour menu had any food but the drinks were very strong. All the food we ordered were very yummy as well (besides the wings), slightly on the pricier side.

Overall a great place to come and experience for yourself

Our friends from CT told us about this historic bar down by Wall Street and since we were doing the One World Center we decided to hoof it on over and try it.

This place is rustic, has old world charm and is clean.  There are many rooms to this place plus a couple of sitting bars.
There was a jazz band playing music on Saturday afternoon, it added to the atmosphere.

Service was really good, the food wasn't bad but wasn't anything to write home about.  The Oyster Stout draft was excellent.

It's a must try if you are in the area.

Unfortunately we didn't get to try the food. We came in for libations and to rest our tired feet.

The server was very accommodating and help us with our adult beverage selections.

So much history in one place was great to see.
