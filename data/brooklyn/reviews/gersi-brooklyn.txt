Easily one of the best Italian restaurants in NYC! I have been lucky and always able to get in without reservations. Prices for food and wine are reasonable and staff is pleasant and attentive. The back patio is completely covered - invaluable for covid dining! I was here during a rainstorm and was completely dry and comfortable.

Bruschetta is a must-order (breakfast or brunch), along with the chicken parm (either as a sandwich or with side order of pasta). Also really enjoyed the sautéed calamari. They have a surprisingly big menu and lots of specials every day, and pasta tastes fresh!

Note that they will take card but prefer cash for payment.

The best meal I've had since before quarantine.

I'm a picky Italian American who can cook and this places flavors blew my mind. There was a table full of us. The wine, many appetizers and pasta entrees we ordered were all delicious and so authentic. One of the best in Brooklyn.

Service was also so great.

I am so glad we chose Gersi for one of our first outdoor dining experiences. Four of us ate at their outdoor dining area on the street and we were the only people there. This made it more comfortable for us, but I wish we chose the spacious backyard instead. If you're reading this, definitely ask for the backyard space!

I had to try the spaghetti al limone - I've never heard of a dish like this before and with the hot, humid weather we've been experiencing the idea of refreshing citrus won me over. This dish did not disappoint! Every bite had a perfect mix of crisp lemon, creamy cheese, and pasta. I'm not sure if they make their pasta in-house or not, but the texture of the spaghetti was absolutely perfect with just enough chew.

My friends got the carbonera, which was also excellent, and the black linguini. I appreciate that Gersi gave bread and oil before the food came, margins are tight these days and that gesture went a long way (the bread was tasty too).

Great choice for takeout or delivery or outdoor dining. I need to come back to visit the backyard!

Shame on you Gersi. While your food is consistently delicious, you are most certainly violating Covid dining rules. Your back "garden" is covered in non breathable plastic coating and it covers 90% of the surface area which makes for very little ventilation. It was PACKED out there tonight, so much so that we asked to sit along the front end of the bldg on Court Street. Furthermore, there are way too many people inside the restaurant (employees, tables, passers by). Diners beware, it does not feel safe in there and in this time of huge surges in cases, I'm shocked that the business owners are not doing more to protect their employees and customer base.

I've been meaning to try Gersi for quite some time now but with their cash only policy, I placed it on the back burner. They now accept credit cards and I had the opportunity to order food to go last night.  Granted, with Phase 2 in full swing (outdoor dining), there was the option to eat on the premises, sidewalk seating or backyard patio.

We kept it simple when placing our order. As I browsed the menu, it appeared pasta dishes were dominant. They are known for their fresh pasta which was our selection for the mains after an appetizer order of Shishito Peppers.

The peppers were good but similar to others I had elsewhere. Charred and slightly salted, they were a satisfying portion.
For main, I chose the Lemon Pasta. After reading reviews about this pasta being a popular pick, I decided to go with having high expectations.
The other main was a Mint Pasta--yes, mint and unusual.

My overall impression trying Gersi for the first time was one of ambivalence. The Lemon Pasta, although flavorful was a bit bland. It was more of a lemon butter sauce and I expected more cheese to be integrated in the pasta dish but it wasn't. Some cracked pepper would have been a good addition. The Mint pasta was unique and difficult to describe since I never experienced so much mint in a pasta dish. In summary, I felt slightly let down.

Despite this experience, I am willing to give Gersi another try--perhaps dining al fresco now that restaurants are open and the weather is accommodating.

What a great find! Booked this for a birthday dinner and I'm so glad I did. We were seated in a gorgeous courtyard in the back (they also have patio seating in the front) and the staff was so accommodating even with our large party. The food was all amazing (we got a variety of bruschetta and pastas, the panzanella salad, and the roasted chicken entree) and they have great service. They used to be cash only but do take credit cards now. Highly recommend!!!

I'm so happy I came here! We ordered mussels, kale Caesar salad with a side of grilled chicken, and the chicken parm with spaghetti. All of it was amazing. Also, the staff informed us that they only had enough mussels for a half order. I was fine with that. I'll definitely be returning here again!

Overall:4.2/5
Food: 5/5
Service: 3/5

We came here around 7:30pm on a Saturday night. Surprisingly we were able to get a table for 2 without any wait.

The food was AWESOME. We got mezzi rigatoni ragu dinner, black linguini with calamari, roasted garlic bruschetta, and tiramisu. All of them taste amazing and we really enjoyed it.

The only 2 things we wish they can improve is:
1. No one told us this was cash only. Usually the waiter will tell us at the beginning but no one informed us. And we didn't notice any sign saying cash only at the entrance.(maybe there's one but it was not obvious)

2. The wait time for food and service(especially checkout) was long. We understand that they might be busy during dinner hour. The waiter actually saw us while passing by, but she/he didn't come to our table until around 10 min after.

My mom and I had just finished getting our nails done down the block and wanted a quick bite to eat before heading home. It was a completely random Tuesday night, but Gersi was packed.

We managed to grab two seats by the bar and placed our orders with the lovely bartender. She did everything - take orders, make drinks, settle bills - all with a smile.

We split an order of the grilled calamari, which was a fairly large portion for the price. I had the roasted chicken with mashed potatoes. Man, the entire plate was mashed potato - I loved it!! I definitely left very, very full. The chicken moist and flavorful.

Tip: Cash only, so make sure you bring some!

This place is PERFECT, with the brunch of my dreams. They have the brunch staples I love (eggs Benedict and French toast w/ berries) that are both beautiful and delicious. It was a hot day, but their outdoor seating is covered and has fans so it was a reasonable temperature + gorgeous decor. My friends and I chatted for two hours and their service was great, with lots of water refills and smiles.

Note: cash only

I hear their pasta is good too! I will definitely be back here if I'm in the area

Had a great meal here. My favorite item was the spaghetti alla limone covered with a tasty cloud of grated parmigiana reggiano. We shared the arugula, pear, Gorgonzola salad and the watermelon salad and both were excellent.

I liked that my iced tea came in a smurf glass and that the plates didn't match - made me feel at home.

Service was friendly and efficient. The tables are a bit close but was otherwise comfortable.

We came in with a large group for our friends birthday one night and had a really great time. The restaurant is pretty small but we were seated right away with our reservation. We got 2 bottles of wine and I really enjoyed the red chianti we got.

To start they bring out bread with a bean salsa which was amazing. I couldnt stop eating it. It was super garlicky and I loved it! To eat I got the kale gnocchi with a tomato and garlic cream sauce. They were absolutely delicious! I highly recommend this dish! I also tried my boyfriends black linguini with calamari and it was also delicious!

To end we got molton chocolate cakes which were delicious as well. I loved the fresh fruit it came with.

Overall, the service was fantastic and we had a wonderful time. Only think is its cash only so dont forget to stop at the atm beforehand!

I can not say enough good things about this spot! Thankfully for me, i just moved around the corner and decided to check it out on a date night with my boyfriend. The inside is super intimate. Dim lit and brick walls. Good music playing in the background. We sat at the bar since it was busy and really enjoyed our experience. The bartender served us and she was beyond attentive and helpful. For drinks we had the Rasberry Gimlet and the Italian Old Fashion. Additionally, we had the prosciutto and fruit, garlic bread, ricotta pasta, and vanilla panna cotta for dessert. Everything was delicious!! We were beyond impressed by this place. We will absolutely be back to try everything else on the menu. Additionally, they had a huge outdoor back patio seating as well.

** note, this place is cash only

This Valentine's day, my boyfriend and I decided that it was finally time to check out this Italian hot spot and booked our reservations three weeks in advance. The restaurant was jam packed! We lucked out by scoring a stand-along table in the corner by the window, but I could not help but feel sorry for the less fortunate patrons seated in a long row of tables, seemingly shoulder to shoulder.

As the complimentary bread and bean dip in olive oil came out, I was all too ready to declare my love for Gersi. That dip was delish - perfectly garlicky, light kick of spice. Yum! Next, we decided to split two entrees and forego an appetizer.

Scallops and saffron risotto: scallops were just ok - although tender and sweet, they were a bit sandy and needed to have been washed with a bit more care (no one enjoys that annoying crunch when biting down on food), and a squeeze of lemon would have improved them as well. The risotto was gummy, tough, and dry, and we ended up leaving most of it completely untouched. Huge bummer for a dish priced at $32.

Lamb ragu pappardelle: although a slight improvement from the scallop dish, this entree left much to be desired as well. Pasta was super overcooked and thus mushy, and the sauce was flat and flavorless. Not once were we asked if we needed any Parmesan or freshly ground black pepper (or anything at all, for that matter). I could not help but get Chef Boyardee flashbacks from my college days with every bite of this dish.

Unfortunately, the complimentary bread and dip was the highlight of the whole meal for us. Perhaps this was a one off night for Gersi with it being a busy Valentine's night, but I have a hard time believing that since the wait time here on any weekend night can easily exceed 45 minutes without reservations. I simply do not get what all the fuss is about. In a city like New York (or even just Brooklyn), there's much better Italian to be had.

I went with my spouse and my mother in law for a Thanksgiving dinner, for the first time we decided to do so not to cook all the typical food only for 3 people.
The place is cozy. There was a lovely Italian waiter who was very informative, attentive and kind.
The Thanksgiving menu was very nice. Very good panzanella, nice pumpkin soup, and a huge plate with turkey, stuffing, a bit undercooked Brussel sprouts, and warm (we like it hot!) but good sweet mashed potatoes.
Great pumpkin pie!
The prosecco we had as an aperitif was mediocre, the wine was nice but a bit overpriced for what it was (Rosso di Montalcino, not Brunello!).
On the whole it was was a very nice dinner, wothout being fabulous, but it worked greatl!

So today we decided to be lazy and order breakfast. I had scrambled eggs with home fries & bacon while my bf had the French toast with a side of bacon . Everything was delicious  it came with complimentary bread, beans and a side salad . The bread was nice and soft and the bean were quite tasty ... my only issue was salad . There was so much dirt and grime on the leaves  it's obvious no one has rinse them ...

I highly recommend the black linguine with calamari and the kale gnocchi with red sauce. The table bread also comes with a light lentil dip made of butter, oil, spinach, garlic, and a faint spice. Everything was delicious and the atmosphere was great for a weekend date night.

I have also been to Cafe Buon Gusto and I Sodi in the last month, both of which were fantastic, and I honestly enjoyed the Italian food and the atmosphere more at Gersi!

My brother and his girlfriend are here often, so they made a reservation for us while we were visiting. They seated us out in the back in the greenhouse area, which was perfect as the weather was great that evening.

Our kids split the spaghetti lemon and I had the seasonal papardelle. Delicious variety of veggies and super fresh pasta. Fresh and tasty throughout.

My brother got the roasted chicken and it was MASSIVE and tasty, on a bed of mashed potatoes.

Oh and we also started with the kale Caesar and that is not to be missed! If we find ourselves back in BK we will be back!

It was okay. We got a good table. Had to ask two or three times for little things... Light the candle, some pepper for the salad, stuff like that.

Panzanella salad we had was mostly kale, very little soaked bread or tomatoes.

Tagliatele was good pasta but it was supposed to have asparagus and peas... Almost no asparagus.

Waiter was nice. Good wine list. Cash only? I tried checking in on yelp but the free glass house wine is only during happy hour.

My boyfriend and I had our New Year's eve dinner here.  The space is a lot bigger than I initially thought. There's a dining areas in the front, then a secondary and more spacious dining area in the back.  We had the Burrata, Tagliatelle ala Bolognese and the Pappardelle with wild mushrooms.  The Burrata was extremely fresh and well made.  The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente.  I will definitely come back again to try the other dishes.  The food was excellent!

Gersi! You were such a treat!

Came here on a sunny Sunday afternoon with my friend. Immediately got seated in the garden, which is SO BEAUTIFUL. Seriously, even though it was insanely hot outside, the view was worth it. It is so picturesque and quiet, I forgot I was in the city.

The staff was amazing, super attentive and friendly. After all the reviews about the mushroom bruschetta and spaghetti al limone, my friend and I made sure to order them. And they did not disappoint. The bruschetta is seriously some of the best I've ever had. The pasta dish was so simple yet so delicious. Portions were really reasonable as were the prices!

I am definitely coming back to try other pastas, but dude, I know i'm getting the bruschetta every time. Thank you for such a wonderful afternoon!!

Went back for dinner tonight and it exceeded our expectations. We had the pork chop in a delectable sauce with sautéed broccoli. It was simple yet outstanding. My mom had the roast chicken with mashed potatoes and she said it was the best roast chicken she's ever had. A huge shout out to Claudia, who was superb, and went above and beyond to ensure we were happy and very comfortable.  Phenomenal food and service from Claudia and the staff.  Love this place!

Had the most delightful brunch here yesterday. They start you off with their delicious bread and some type of beans. I think it was chickpeas but it had a nice kick to it.  My mom thoroughly enjoyed her scrambled eggs with potatoes and bacon and my eggs Benedict with house cured salmon was the very best I've had in a very very long time. Oh and the coffee is stellar!  The excellent food combined with the super friendly service makes this a fantastic find. Can't wait to return to try their dinner.

When I first visited this place I sincerely never thought I'd become so obsessed. But alas here we are two weeks in and I've been here more times than I can count.

They also have me hooked on Italian and this is the farthest period I've gone being obsessed almost exclusively with Italian food. I'd recommend this place to anyone who's a lover of good food and a nice peaceful environment to enjoy it in.

I've been coming to Gersi for over a year now. It's my best friend and I's "spot". Everything about this place is amazing. The atmosphere. The staff. The food. It's divine.

My go-to dish is the Limone pasta. The tangy lemon mixed with the creamy Parmesan is a taste experience like no other.

If you're someone who loves small indulgences, finish off with an affogato. You will not be disappointed.

Nothing bad to say about this place.

I had a delicious pasta made of spinach and kale with tomato and cream sauce. My wife had the lasagne. We ordered the eggplant side and a bottle of Barbera.

The pork chops, broccoli rab, and the garlic bruschetta were amazing! The service was so good - Claudia was an absolute sweetheart. I would definitely come back!

I have to say, the tagliatelle was ok but I'm eager to come back and try the cacio e pepe.

In a historically Italian neighborhood packed with pasta joints, this relative newcomer just might be my favorite.

I can't help but liken it to Supper in the East Village (this is high praise if you had any idea how many times I've eaten at Supper). I don't know if the two places are related, but I lived down the street from that staple of the neighborhood for many years, and Gersi evokes the same comfortable feel. Here they also start you off with excellent bread and a white bean dip; the rustic decor, personable service, and quality across the entire menu just keep the similarities rolling.

Like all the best Italian spots, the specials menu often outshines the staples. Off of either list though, we haven't had a bad pasta yet. From simple dishes like the Spaghetti Al Limone to meatier fare such as the orecchiette or tagliatelle, all have been executed well. I'm looking forward to trying the lasagna for the first time.

If for some inexplicable reason you don't want pasta, I'd suggest you make a tasty meal of the simple grilled branzino, greens, and well-roasted brussels sprouts. If you don't like my suggestions, you can take a page from my wife's book and directly disobey me by getting the seemingly boring beet ravioli (I guess that's also pasta). Obviously, it was fantastic, adding one more entry to the long list of times I was embarrassingly wrong.

On the negative side of Gersi, I can't lie to you (we're too close for that): the lighting is too romantic for good food photos, and there WAS a slight mix up with the tables that caused us to get our food about 45 seconds later than we could've. But since I'm not a complete asshole, I'm going to go ahead and say that didn't matter.

I think I'm going to come in here a lot.

Cash only.

Gathered 15 of my friends here for a garden seated birthday dinner! The staff is very accommodating and reserved the back garden area for our group. a great spot for special events, large and small parties. Highlights were

We are family style and tried the black kale salads, tagliatelle bolognese, rigatoni ragu, cacio e Pepe, orecchiette, a squid pasta and mussels. Highlights were the tagliatelle and squid pasta!

Cash only is my only gripe, especially for larger groups.
