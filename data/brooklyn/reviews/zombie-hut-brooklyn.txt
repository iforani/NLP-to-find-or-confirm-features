Happy to find another gem that has an outdoor area with plenty of space to social distance all under a shade provided by a glorious tree. Drinks are easy / reasonable / refreshing.

Went to this place on a Wednesday night to meet with some coworkers. It's on a pretty busy block with plenty of bars and restaurants that are open for outdoor seating. Zombie hut has a large backyard patio that was fairly full with socially distanced tables, probably able to accommodate about 10ish parties at a time. I saw people with pizza and wings but didn't see a food menu so I'm now wondering if they allow outside food to be brought in, but if it was from zombie hut it looked pretty good.

The drinks: nice pours, tasty, and reasonably priced. I got the blue lagoon ($8) which was a blue margarita and it was very balanced but I could still taste the alcohol which I like. A friend got the frozen drink ($12) which he really liked. I definitely intend to return.

Ps: it's about 2 blocks from the F train Carroll st station. Plenty of street parking nearby. Device was nice enough but you do have to go inside to order. I would def return.

Last night I went to Zombie Hut per usual.  I entered with my service dog to find the usual response, "no dogs".  I told him it was a "service dog".  I got a blank stare.  I then repeated "service dog" and I got the same stare.  Then I said that I had ID and he asked to look at it.

I'd like to touch on the ID aspect.  It is illegal for an establishment to ask for ID.  I provide ID because I don't want to make a fuss.  There is no registry for service dogs.  Therefore, you never know what ID is real or faked /what dog has undergone training.  Anyways, if you don't believe me look it up.  It's illegal to ask for papers and there's no official service dog registry.

Post showing the bouncer my service dogs card (my service dog has undergone 200 hours of training FYI) I entered and saw the 3 bartenders ignoring patrons to take a round of shots.  We tried to order something and she said, "1. It's going to be $10 and 2. We don't allow dogs."

I kindly explained it was a "service dog".  The bartender said and I quote, "are you sure it's not an emotional support dog?" I said "no... it's a SERVICE DOG".  She then said, "ARE YOU SURE?!" They then demanded my papers.  I told them to check with the bouncer as he already checked them.  One bartender had to drag the other away because she was adamant that I was pretending I had a service dog.  She appeared to be immensely intoxicated as she was screaming and waving her hands at me.

She then went to the other bartender to (loudly) bad mouth me.  "There is no way that is a service dog...that is absolutely an emotional support dog... that doesn't even look like a service dog".  She was clearly thrown off by the fact that he was in a bag specially made for service dogs that holds him at my waist.  Ignorance is

I went back up to her and said the following.. "How dare you, I have ears.  He is in a bag at my waste in order to preform his task.  Just because you are ignorant doesn't mean my dog is not a service dog."  How INSULTING.

Management step up.

The Zombie Hut is a great find in this neighborhood of Brooklyn and the drinks are fantastic! Normally, I wouldn't order a frozen drink because they never seem to do the job, and I get throat/brain freeze! However, the Frozen Zombie is absolutely legit!! Lots of rum with orange and pineapple juice, perfectly blended, made me impressed! The ambiance is really cool here as well! There is ample
seating outside and it's like you're in a tiki hut!! When in the neighborhood, I know where I'll be going for another frozen drink!!

Stop #2 along the Smith street bar hopping tour. This place has all the things you need in a year round bar - indoor, inbetween, and outdoor seating.

The prices aren't too crazy and the blue hawaiin was strong and tasty. The decor for halloween was simple but perfect for Halloween. Need to come back here to see how different it is during regular season since it is a Zombie Hut.

This was a pretty cool establishment. The drinks were strong and it was like being a dead beach party lol.  I loved the decor and the people were nice. Parking sucks on smith street. But all in all a decent place.

Strangely wasn't crowded that one Friday we went, but I still admire the ambiance and decor of this place! It is definitely spooky, ominous (haha) and I think this place is perfect for a Halloween party.. all year round! I like the nice sitting area inside. I remember sitting next to a skeleton and that was cool, haha.

Drank this blue tequila based mixed drink here and it was delicious. I hope to come back.

Zombie hut. You kill me. In a good, rather great way. If you're in for a reliable dive bar, a quiet back yard, games at the bar, sweet cocktail kinda place take your brain to Zombie Hut.

It's been a staple of the hood for-evah and for good reason. It's consistent and WYSIWYG. No pretense. No trying to be hipster. No attitude. Just good neighborhood drinks with an always fun soundtrack.

Stop in, best served with another brainy friend, get a fishbowl and a few straws. You'll smile.

Wow, this spot is cool and unique. They have backyard that has a hawaiian vibe to it. It's so cute and cozy. The drinks are delicious too. It's a great place to come to if you just want to chat with your friends and feel the fresh air or if you wanna enjoy a romantic date. It's also a great place to bring a large party and have fun. Ideal to come here when the weather is good. They have a closed space too but I like the backyard better. I played it safe and had the margarita and it tasted strong and delicious like it should. Had a great and memorable time here. Will come again :)

I've gone to Zombie Hut for years. Yesterday was my first night at a bar since the beginning of the pandemic. We sat in the backyard and had a fair amount of space, but after spending over $200 on drinks, they asked us to move to a smaller table to accommodate another party. When they walked us to our new table, we saw that it was not 6 feet apart from neighboring tables. Overall, the waitress was rude. It's irresponsible to have tables on top of each other during a pandemic.

My new favorite bar ever! I love a good theme, and the Zombie Hut nails a theme I love- tiki! Zombie Hut features a classic tiki cocktail menu- Bahama Mama, Singapore Sling, Mai Tai! I had the Bahama Mama and the Singapore Sling- both were amazingly delicious. The drinks are affordable ($7) and strong!

The decor is also super fun! They have indoor seating and a patio/ courtyard out back. Visit this spot, you'll love it. If I lived in Brooklyn, I'd be here daily!

Had an afternoon date with a lad here after we both figured out we had obsessions with tiki bars.

Total tiki bar vibe. The place was quiet around 3pm on a rainy Saturday. We got two sits barside and were able to talk to each other calmy. The service was quick and non-intrusive.

The drinks were good. Good not great. Reminded me of drinks we made in college ourselves. But they're pretty strong so there's that. After around 2.5 rounds we began to feel a bit tipsy.

The decor is very tiki, but it's more dive tiki. And not in the charmy way Otto's is.There's something slightly off about this place. I was a bit disappointed.

I'll come back in the summer and check out the backyard. If you're in the area it's worth a visit. But I don't think it's necessary to travel out of the way to come here.

This place rocks! We stumbled in after looking around for a bar that has board games that we could hang out in before heading back to Manhattan.

The entry door to this place is also super cool, it looks like a tiki mask. We walk in and settled into a couple of comfy couches and were canoodling in the back. It's a very cozy atmosphere with cute tiki lights, up beat edm music playing, and relatively inexpensive drinks. We ordered the standard beers but the menu looked creative and tiki-tropical inspired. We will be back!

The good: no one really bothers you, fun place to have a conversation or catch up with friends/pregame, not much dancing but there is a fireplace in the back which could be fun!

4/5 stars because the smoke in the back room was super irritating to my eyes.

I loved the atmosphere at this bar and I would definitely return! Me and some friends went on a Saturday night for a few drinks and had a blast. Their beer selection is good and even though it wasn't packed most of the seats were filled but we still managed to find a spot. Apparently they have a fire pit in the back but we did not go back there.

This is NOT a chill come for a drink place, this is a drink to get drunk place.

"The server (olivia) was very uncompromising. A group of 18 professionals decided to provide the bar with some business before the weekend. We each ordered about 2-3 drinks each already. One individual was made a drink but was very unhappy about his order. When asked if he could change the drink he was shut down immediately. He was told he should give the drink to someone else because nothing can be done. I have never experienced this kind of treatment in any of the establishments I have frequented. Olivia was very rude"

She was extremely unwelcoming, used profanity when conversing with us, and even refused to switch the playlist to compliment the guest.

Please also, keep in mind that this isn't our first time visiting the establishment. We returned because our last experience was extremely warm, Fun and welcoming.

Please fix this.

I love the little Tiki vibe going on here. Combine that with some floral prints, fruity drinks, and bamboo things... ok, you can rock it Zombie.

Loves:
+ The theme, obviously
+ Good selection and dare I say budget-friendly drinks, with most $7-12 from my memory
+ A lightness in the air of being somewhere with such ~summery vibes~

The only downside I can really see is the cocktails here aren't as superior as some other joints in the area. But don't get me wrong, they are still good to decent. I would just say you are coming here for the fun vibes in addition to some dranks.

I love zombie hut. I've been going for years. You can always count on a good strong drink at a good price and a pretty chill environment. They don't serve food but you can bring your own food. The patio is really nice and they even have connect four in case your feeling a little competitive.

Kind of torn between two and three stars. You are greeted by a very cool exterior and entry door (check out the handle!) and upon entering see a kitchy decorated bar. The weeknight we visited there were only 2 others in the place. There were three of us, and opted for the Scorpion Bowl cocktail. You need to leave your drivers license at collateral m. Apparently there is a black market for mass produced ceramic punch bowls from China. The scorpion cocktail was made with rum, vodka rosa's lime juice (gasp! Not fresh squeezed limes???) and some sort of fructose sweetened drink mixer. There are Ben some sort of slushee machine drinks kind of like at Fat Tuesday. Having been exposed to the likes of the Mai Kai in Ft. Lauderdale, and Trader Sams in Orlando and Cali... this place pales in comparison. But heck if you want to visit a neat little Brooklyn dive and have a synthetically sweetened cocktail, it's not bad. They have a cool outdoor courtyard with bamboo palisade walls and a decent music track. Just don't expect craft cocktails here and you won't be disappointed. I think the bartender and staff were a bit unfriendly and underwhelming.

ROCK- PAPERS-SCISSORS... SHOOT!

The bartender set us up with a fierce round of rock-paper-scissors to pay the tab and as the winner I got into it with the bartender!  He won- we did a shot together.  Super nice guy!  He even remembers my friends who travel there a few times a year from Rhode Island!

As soon as you walk in it's warm and inviting!  I started to feel 'tropical' in Brooklyn in Late November!  It's clean and delivered me a fruity drink.  I was so comfortable I couldn't ask for anything more.  I like the vibe here!  I would go back for sure.

*If you're lit enough, who cares about bottom shelf taste
Good service
I left my card overnight, and they didn't charge me
Place gets crowded on a Friday
They get more extra stores for the games available
* altho, games don't have all the pieces

This used to be one of my favorite bars in the area. How can you hate on a tiki bar with fun cocktail swizzles of mermaids and stuff? A place that has tons of fun board games, heating lamps in an outdoor garden area? Easily. First, they've raised the prices by about $2-3 on everything over the years so that they may as well be a bar in lower Manhattan. Their drinks were always a little bit watered down to begin with, so that's insane. But the good news is that they have a wider variety of canned and bottled beer now.

Second crumby thing, they got rid of their bring in your own food policy and hired a grumpy ass bouncer. Now mind you, I was not the one to bring in the pizza pie to my friend's birthday this weekend. I honestly don't even know how they managed to sneak it in. But as I was finishing up my beer, my friends had all left for their respective cabs, and I was left with getting yelled at over the pizza. Btw, I didn't clean up the mess in the backyard that they left. Enjoy. They don't really have any real food for sale other than snacks, so I don't get why they turned into the mean kids in the school yard. I had fun until I was harassed by the staff and honestly don't see myself coming back any time soon.

I've been here so many times! It's in a convenient location for me. Close to work and close to home. So I manage to convince people to come here quite often. I even spent my last actual birthday night in the mid-week here chilling with some friends. They have a large backyard area that's open in the spring and summer and heated with lamps when its colder outside. Drinks are stupid strong. I highly recommend the frozen zombie and the planter's punch. If you have a group get one of their scorpion bowls that are lit on fire. They also have a huge amount of board games. My personal favorite, apples to apples! In the winter time the inside nook behind the bar has a fake heated fireplace. It's seasonal and fun. And who doesn't LOVE tiki drinks?! I do! Very reasonably priced for what you get as well. $5 for most of their cocktails. A few of the stronger ones are $7 or 8, but granted, they have like 3-4 shots of different kinds of booze in them. You can order in food. But beyond anything this place is full of fun.

My friends and I came here on a Saturday afternoon. There wasn't much people but the backyard was open! (YAY SUMMMMMERR)

The backyard is cozy but so is the inside. They offer a selection of games as well as decently priced alcohol.

They have BOWLS! Some of which you can keep for a price.

My favorite part of this place is that you can bring your own food - WINNIN'

Simple review of a place with not much nostalgia, but is always fun and satisfying.  A tiki bar spot on a street full of places to go out, but it's different.  Very laid back spot and the drinks are amazing.  We've been about 5 times now and every bartender recommends a new drink to us and they are all wonderful.

You'll never see the place on TV or probably have another Brooklyn hipster do a magazine article about it, but I feel for some reason my next trek to Brooklyn will include a visit to the Zombie Hut.

Thanks

Interesting Spot

We spent a little time here on a night out hitting some bars in the area. It's not a fancy place, but it was fun. They have a little garden in the back (that still allows smoking!?) and that was a nice respite from the crowded interior. We shared a scorpion bowl and it tasted pretty good.

This is probably the kind of place you want to go after you've already had a few drinks.

Thanks

Such a cute little spot with a backyard in Brooklyn! The whole place is decorated with tiki decor and everyone is super friendly (including customers). And don't worry about bugs and mosquitos, they have buckets of insect repellent for you. For those of you who get bored easily or are unlucky and swiped right for the wrong guy or gal, there are board games to pass time. Don't forget about their special tropical drinks! Prices start at $7 and are very strong.

As for food? I recommend you eat before stopping by unless you consider hot pockets real food.

I'll be back to try their scorpion bowls!

I love tiki bars in theory but usually don't end up spending too much time in them. Zombie Hut looks the part and the decor is fun, but the drinks are far from great. Early on a Friday night, neither was the crowd yet: not much mingling or laughter, mainly 20 somethings talking among themselves and an apparently single dad who brought his kid :/ Oh Brooklyn.

Neither the Mai Tai or the Spicy Cucarita came in a tiki glass (maybe it's like Otto's and you have to put in a down payment, not sure, no one offered one to me). Not a huge deal, though that is part of the charm. The spicy drink was way, way too spicy, drowning out whatever taste of cucumber was supposed to be there. I love spicy drinks but this tasted like someone had made a mistake pouring in an ingredient. The Mai Tai was good. Music alternated between alternative to vaguely whiny pop.

They don't serve food, but don't allow you to order your own, so there's also that.

This place is great. Great vibes, perfect lighting (dark), and the drinks are amazing. Me and my gf tried the scorpion bowl and it hit the spot real quick. I definitely recommend this drink if you want to bring out the best fun version of yourself lol. The back of the place outside is great but it's more for a bigger group. If it's just you and your lady then i recommend sitting inside by the couches.

Came here post dinner in the neighborhood- pretty small but it was not to crowded when I arrived (8:30p).
Good selection of cocktails- I opted for the Skinny Colada (perfect after a super filling dinner) and a ton or interesting beers.
They have a bunch of board games that you can take to your table which is always a fun option- so we snagged a Connect 4 game and hung here for about 2 hours until it started to really fill up!

Very nice stylish, yet authentic tiki bar. Great decor and lighting-not divey at all. For me, the drinks were just okay. I tried the Mai Tai and Blue Hawaii and thought they were good, but nothing special. The recipes seemed to incorporate a lot of artificial flavors and sweetness. The Frozen Zombie was the best drink I had-sort of like a boozy rum Orange Julius.

Our bartender, Brandy, was fantastic. Great location on Smith Street. Recommended!

I go to places I like. Good drinks surrounded by good friends... how can you go wrong? Usually I stop in before and after a Gallery opening at MF Gallery. The alcohol probably tastes similar even if there isn't an opening to go to. Worth experimenting!

Came here on a warm night with former co-workers. I couldn't believe this bar was still around on popular Smith Street, but then I remembered how nice it was back then:

1. comfy although a bit divey and I love the red, floral lanterns at the bar;
2. good outdoor space for summer nights;
3. frozen tiki drinks galore!!!

It's been around for ages though, by ages I mean more than a decade. I don't know where it came from but there was a cheesy vibe in the room. Perhaps me and my partners-in-crime for the evening?

Or, perhaps the drinks weren't strong enough? I hadn't been here in years and unfortunately good bartenders don't stay put in one place for long. I remember the drinks I had many years ago were, in fact, a bit impotent but still tasted delicious.

The drink I had here the other night was not strong enough and not tasty enough to make me want to come back.

But I have a really great memory that happened here, so I'll give it another shot.

I have lived in the neighborhood for years and never went here until recently on a nightcap-needed whim. Once I got past the initial terrible smell, the atmosphere was chill and cozy!  My drink was good and well-price ($7 if I recall), I ordered some kind of sweet tea drink on the menu. The bartender was laid-back; not attentive, but that's ok by me; as I don't drink much. I would perhaps return again for an after-work drink... or probably just a nightcap.

This was my first time and I had a good time. When you walk in it just like a regular bar. Nothing nice or fancy. The have a selection of beers but the draw for me were the cocktails. The cocktail menu contains around 15 choices and I set out to try a few. Bartenders were friendly and ready to serve. The drinks were really good, had a kick and inexpensive. We got 6 cocktails and the total was $39. You can't beat that.
There isn't wait staff so you come in, find your spot and get your drinks at the bar. If the weather is nice there is a nice sized outdoor area. The tiki theme is really shown there.
There is a selection of games you can choose from to play with your drinking buddies such as jenga and connect 4.

The drinks here are cheap sure, but that's because they taste awful. Truly terrible. I've been shocked to see this bar on numerous "best tiki bars in America" lists, because while the ambiance and decor is 1950's tiki kitschy cool, I can't get over the nasty, artificial, convenience store drink mix taste of the drink I ordered. I've had better drinks at overpriced resorts in Mexico. Save your money. Get a beer and a shot any other bar on this block instead of ordering the toxic sludge that Zombie Hut calls a cocktail.
