Didn't expect it but, Henry Public was simply mind-blowing. Excellent location. Turkey Leg Sandwich was the menu item that I really desired to try, and it was really amazing. Crew is extremely helpful and definitely will help you with anything. I have nothing bad to say about Henry Public.

Henry Public is absolutely charming!  From the worn and weathered original wood flooring, wall paneling, and saloon style bar booths up front to the semi-private wallpaper adorned dining room featuring an old brick fireplace in the back, Henry Public has a ton of character.

This historic neighborhood pub offers friendly service, delicious fare, well-made classic cocktails, and a wide selection of ice-cold suds on tap.  The burgers are also pretty incredible!  See you soon, Henry Public!

Great drinks menu, and bartenders who know how to make the classics, too. Laid-back, rustic saloon atmosphere. Very pleasant place to spend time with friends. Turkey leg sandwich is out of this world.

I have to start of by saying two stars were docked for the service. I never rate a place based off service but this was unbelievable. My group got to the restaurant around 6 and were told it would be a 20 minute wait to get our table. We ordered drinks while waiting and then 40 minutes later inquired about the wait time. She said she'd set up our table and seat us in 10 minutes. 20 minutes later a new waitress came by who'd just gotten on the shift and told us our waitress didn't realize we wanted a table. Turns out she gave our table away. So they said it would be another 30 minute wait. We patiently ordered fries and another round of drinks while waiting. Another 40 minutes go by and I inquired about the wait time. The new waitress tells me to go sit down because it had only been 15 minutes (it was actually 40). We decided to politely grab our checks and the waitress brings an apologetic basket of fries.

So the whiskey sour was pretty good, but nothing spectacular (even with the egg whites). The smash drink was bitter. The fries were really awesome.

Disappointed would be an understatement to describe how I felt because I was really looking forward to trying their food.

I don't often leave reviews but I feel like I have to in this case. I work late on weekends, which can be really annoying when you get off and everything is closed except for fast food, but this gem stays open late, and unlike most bars, their kitchen does too. The macaroni was amazing, shell pasta with 4 cheeses and bits of baby asparagus baked in mini cast iron skillet and served up still bubbling. There's a gorgeous runny egg nestled under the breadcrumb topping and fresh herbs as well. I can't wait to be back!

Side note, I love the relaxing vibe of the old school music.

I was exhausted and starving.  At the moment when I thought all hope was lost, Henry Public's turkey leg sandwich restored my body and mind to full health.  Great cozy interior evokes European pubs.  Great service.  Will come back.

SHAME!.... SHAME!..... SHAME! Is what I am yelling at myself for waiting 3 FREAKING YEARS to come here! I live like 3 blocks away, and here you are.....waiting patiently in all your magnificent glory.

Cozy and classic atmosphere that is both vintage and perfectly inviting for any group of friends. SHAME!

$5 beers during happy hour. SHAME!

Bone Marrow app that my friend licked clean after all the succulent buttery marrow was scarfed. SHAME! (ok, on him this time)

The Turkey Leg Sandwich......Tenderly moist turkey leg meat piled to the clouds with a fried onion topping and sliced homemade pickles on the side if you so choose to add them. All placed in between the heartiest thick cut multi grain bread. The BEST Turkey sandwich I dare say I have ever had! DELISH! SHAME!!!

For all these glorious blessings brought on to my neighborhood, and for ignoring the Henry Public sign for so long. I....am....SHAMED. (Cue me walking home butt naked with turkey sandwich in hand)

This is probably my favorite spot in this neighborhood. A simple menu where everything on there is delicious. The staff has been around for years so you see familiar faces when you arrive - the decor and lighting is really nice and chill - I love the burger, the fries, the deviled eggs - I haven't indulged in it but I hear great things about the turkey sandwich and the steak + eggs. Most times I bring someone out in this neighborhood, this is usually the place I take them.

A great local haunt...

This is my go to during the winter and on Sundays. The atmosphere hardens back "old" New York, circa turn of the century. That alone, keeps me coming back regularly.

As for the food -- the turkey sandwich is a must, followed by the marrow bones -- also, a hidden gem is their vegetable side dishes. They usually roast them and offer a mixed variety hat usually rotates (carrots were amazing)

Check out Sunday's when they have live jazz -- outstanding trio who take requests...

Overall: love this place and so should you!! Also a great place to have a drink while you wait for your table at Hibino sushi (not to be missed)

What a hidden little local spot! HP has a very historic, classic, vibe to it - from it's wooden pub-type atmosphere, candle lit tables, and old photographs of dead, famous folks like Fredrick Douglass (not sure why).

Excellent cocktails, and if you are looking to order food from the menu, I recommend snagging a table in the small back area to avoid the louder bar scene.

As everyone who goes here says - just order their famous Turkey Leg Sandwich w/ fries ($18) - a giant pile of moist, flavorful, rich, shredded turkey (think pulled pork style!) served in a perfectly charred thick toast. This isn't your basic dry Thanksgiving turkey, folks. Don't hesitate on ordering it, even if you aren't the biggest turkey fan.

Their fries were also on point - perfect amount of crisp and chew.

We also tried their bone marrow w/ toast dish, which was forgettable. It was quite dry and required a lot of effort to scoop out the tiny marrow from the bone.

I was in the mood for a burger on Saturday, and my fellow burger hunting wife had heard good things about Henry Public. Great, old-timey feel.

She went with the popular turkey leg sandwich and I the burger. I also had a seasonal Kolsch if I am being completely honest.

Anyway, I like my burger dressed a certain way. They typically just have pickles on the side, but they made it happen with the lettuce, tomato, and onion. I was very impressed by that. The burger was very good. Cooked the perfect medium, as I requested. Fries are good, too.

If you have read any reviews, you know the turkey leg sandwich is great. No complaints there.

I'd like to think that service is the only aspect that keeps this from being a five star review. (Server was cordial, but not attentive) I personally don't like to complain about prices, as I can find that information before choosing to dine there. But I do think that the sandwiches could be 3 or 4 dollars cheaper than they are. That being said, I really enjoyed the food and would recommend it if the price (and cash only stipulation) jive with you.

Very cool old school bar. They had live music when I went in on a random Sunday. It was late afternoon and only a few people in the bar, but the band was still on.

To say the decor is vintage would be understating it. The walls have aged photos. The bathroom looks like an elementary school. There are folding chairs to sit on.

They don't have the most beers, but what they have is decent. Definitely worth stopping in for a low key drink.

Walked by on our way to dinner and decided to go back for a drink after - can't comment on the food but our drinks were great. Definitely pricey but standard for what it was - nice, interesting cocktails in NYC. The service was quick and the bartender was friendly. It was very busy when we went but it wasn't too loud. Would definitely go back if I was in the area again.

Such a cute place!  Old school vibe with live jazz every Sunday from 3-7.  Fun and unique cocktails and a super friendly staff.  A great place to hang with friends.  The tables are small so I wouldn't recommend large groups.
Really cool little neighborhood bar, with an awesome colonial feel! The drinks were equally good, though the beer selection was kinda lacking IMO.

Love this place neighborhood spot. Well-worn (in the best way)  and comfortable with the feeling of a country pub in England. Fabulous music during the day on the weekends (I think Sundays but check on that) and the food is gastropub-style but less heavy.

It's rare to find a place like this that serves up great drink, food and wonderful service (especially the bartenders) and a really nice, varied crowd.

My husband and I loved this place until I got sick to the point of vomiting. It was so bad! :(   The first time it happened, I thought to myself, perhaps I have some sort of stomach bug, but when it happened the second time after eating the exact same thing there, I began to wonder....Hmmmm...Anyway, not discouraging anyone from going there, just warning you to take heed.

I feel like I just made love to a sandwich.

There should be a complimentary cigarette after every meal.

Service was great. Cocktails were great. I would run away and start a new life with the turkey leg sandwich.

If you walk in here, it's going to feel like you stepped back in time. It's like an old house became a bar/kitchen for locals to escape the norm.

I've yet to try the food, but drinks are great (albeit expensive for this area) and there's live entertain regularly. My favorite drink is the sweet liberty smash -- yum!

OH, it's cash only, so remember to bring a $100 bill for ya drinks!

Always wanted to try the burger here. Today I did and I was extremely underwhelmed by the quality, old bun, dryness, lack of add-ons (pickles only). I will say that the fries are pretty solid.
The drinks are also good... but I'd hold out for a superior burger elsewhere.

The service was great! The decor is lovely and I do appreciate the flashback to old English country. The food however solidifies the stereotype of bland gastronomy that even the English speak of themselves. The burger was a bad combo of powerful cheese and bland over cooked beef (though I asked for it rare), the fries were boring skinny salty sticks. The English breakfast was as boring as it sounds as well.
Nice place for drinks. Keep it at that.

I can't even begin to tell you how excellent my meal was.    My son and I were in Brooklyn for one night, and were starving at midnight.  When we found Henry public we did not have high expectations. When you enter the restaurant it's like a step back in time to an old New England pub. The waiter was very helpful and kind. I ordered pot roast which was the best pot roast I've had in my life. The smashed root vegetables and roasted parsnips were delicious. I don't remember but my son had but he was thrilled. We finished with homemade donuts with caramel sauce. I will definitely come here again when we visit Brooklyn.

*Now accepting credit cards*

I could have loved this place. The decor is cozy and charming, and the turkey leg sandwich & fries are perfect comfort food. Great cocktails.
But the service! I can't think of an excuse for how inattentive and slow the employees on the floor were. It was a quiet night and the bartender had plenty of time to chat with a friend & eat dinner while we waited for the waitress to appear... and waited for our drinks to appear... There seems to be some confusion & lack of communication between employees- or maybe they're just uninterested. Left us feeling not quite relaxed.

Bad burger = bad food.   cheddar cheese is sourtasting and messes up burger.  They only offer cheddar.

Fries are not exciting.  If coming for the "cool" vibe, i get it.   But the food is not cool.

Ok this quirky bar is still quirky and I am just not enough of a drinker to appreciate the quality of the cocktails they make but I must say I was pleasantly surprised by Henry Public's brunch.

After walking down Atlantic at 2pm on a Sunday in search of a place that would seat 5 of us and repeatedly being told the wait would be 45 minutes, we arrived at Henry Public and sat at the bar enjoying some drinks waiting for our table which only took 15 minutes. Score!

The menu is small, but everything on it looked delicious. They also have daily specials. My recommendation is to get an order of the Wilkinsons (dough balls with jam) and the Sweet & Salty French Style toast for the table and then order your own meal on top of it. It's a lot of food but then you don't have to make the decision between a sweet brunch or a savory one like the Turkey leg sandwich (which is enormous) or an egg dish.

I'm not sure I've ever been to Henry Public during daylight before but it gave me a chance to appreciate the decor a lot more than I do during my night visits. You feel like you're sitting in someone's dining room in the 1800's (and you probably are).

My only complaint is a minor one. There seemed to be only one waitress for the entire restaurant which slowed things down a bit. It's not enough of a minus for me not to return.

Excellent brunch!

Over priced and over hyped but it's open late and serves food which is why I keep coming back. The drinks are good and the staff is very nice and quirky. The crowd is what I would describe as upscale hipster but not quite ready to be a full fledged yuppie.

I wish they had a bigger menu and it were a little quieter

Came around 7pm on a Friday for dinner. The timing was perfect because it appeared to get pretty packed as we were leaving. Cute little quaint place, felt like I was in someone's house. Turkey leg sandwich was delicious and I was even more impressed with their sweet potato mash. They were so light and fluffy! Sadly there was a long hair in my sandwich. Understand it happens, I was just a bit grossed out. But customer service was good and I am glad I checked it out. Order their speciality dessert. Reminded me of zeppoles. Warm and delicious. I would like to come back for brunch or lunch. Was

Yeah, I'm so not feeling it. I walked into this place and immediately fell in love with the old timey vibe, the Edison bulbs hanging from the ceiling, the old, tiny booths and pressed tin ceilings. Circa 1938. Not quite Speakeasy, but Post Prohib chic (really, you can tell me I'm talking out of my...) This kind of bar has been popping up on the regular in this part of Brooklyn. But what else hit me as soon as I sat down? The lousy acoustics. Expect to be shouting to the person sitting one foot away.

But that wouldn't be so bad, really. I probably would opt to go elsewhere on Atlantic (love that cute new French place that opened up, but it seems to close hella early on a Thursday night) and if I wanted a loud and boisterous setting, Last Exit is right there, too. It's just that the loudness is so at odds with what seems like an intimate vibe.

Again, that's not my main issue with Henry Public. It's the utter bull$hit of being cash-only. Seriously. If a tiny one-person operation in a gallery on St. Claude St. in New Orleans can take credit cards when the average tab is $5, so can a "gastropub" where most cocktails are around $13 (I had two decent champagne cocktails that I liked OK, though nothing to write home about). End of story. No sign on the door warning you, either. How incredibly ridiculous to be scrambling for cash in this day and age when there's an app for that.

You can keep it.

Popped in for a quick drink before dinner. Was tottering around like an idiot trying to find it because they are doing some construction or something on the lot next door and it completely threw me off. Doesn't seem like this gem of a restaurant should be there but it is!!

Staff was SO nice! Very accommodating, I only had one drink (something with Pimms in it, I forget what else but honestly you had me at Pimms) but I am very excited to come back for more! I got there maybe around 8pm on a Friday night and within the hour the place was packed with people jostling around the door!

Off the beaten bar path CASH-ONLY $11 cocktail joint with good sandwiches.

it was a little annoying that "cash-only" was hidden in fine print on the menu but the service and food were good.

They are known for their turkey leg sandwich, which is stuffed with potato chips to give it some crunch. delectable.

2 cocktails, 1 beer, grilled cheese, turkey sandwich and brussel sprouts with bacon = $70. a little pricey but delicious nonetheless. I'd go back.

I guess a smile is too much to ask for.

Interestingly, this place has charm to burn. It has an old world vibe and decor that just brings you right in. You want to love this place. You want to "fit in" to this cozy little world, a world that makes you wish you wore more bow ties.

The charm ends about there though. The service - the whole lot of 'em - couldn't be more disinterested if they tried. I've been here a few times over the past year and the service is consistently cold, icy, distant. The bartenders are prompt, but in an aggressive "let's get this done" way. I've never wanted to "hang out" here, because the service is so flat and weirdly intense. No smiles. No "thank you's." Nothin'.

I had an Oddfellow cocktail, and it was quite fine. (The cocktails are inventive and done well.)

The last time I went, Saturday midday, the place was packed, to a degree I suspect reviews of HP are irrelevant. My hope though, is that someone who works there reads this, and attempts to learn & share the fine art of being hospitable.

Inconsistent service and the meanest, rudest waiters and bartenders.

I used to love this place. They have one of the best dishes to eat in all of Downtown Brooklyn; however, my last three visits have turned me off and I'm not going back.  Usually, I would just say, "Oh well," and never return, but I don't think they deserve to prosper anymore.  They are inconsistent with their standards (sometimes they let you order the turkey leg sandwich with the meat on top of the fries, other times they do not; sometimes they let you place an order to go if you've been drinking at the bar and just want to take something with you; other times they do not).  However, the biggest turnoff is the staff!!!  I understand that the venue is going for a certain feel and vibe - and maybe they want the staff to look and act a certain way - but, goddamn, at least be nice to your customers.
