3 floors. Good crowd. All ages. Fantastic happy hours deals. That's why it's packed on a Friday night. Where else can you get a $5 IPA during HH?!

Friendly crowd. Straight forward bartenders. They run a tight ship. I respect that. Down to earth joint, especially located in FiDi. Can't speak to the food. Will try and update next time.

Come one, come all! Cheers!

My colleagues and I came here yesterday for our office holiday party. It was a lunch buffet style setup where we had appetizers, entrees, and cake. The party was held on the 3rd floor and the room was brightly lit and spacious. The food was good and I really like fried calamari appetizer, chicken marsala, and the cake.

The only thing that I didn't like was that we had to wait an hour before the entrees were ready to be served. Our party time was from 1 - 4pm and the hot entrees wasn't ready until 2pm. At least the appetizers were already setup for us when we arrived. Overall, the service was still good here.

Love this place! Was in town visiting from the Detroit area and was so happy we found this gem that reminds me of a bar back home. On the high end of a dive bar with good bar good, nice alcohol options, friendly service and just a cozy welcoming pub.
Went there twice within four days if that tells you anything!

I went to White Horse Tavern for lunch and got the Bridge Street Burger Deluxe with Sweet Potato Fries. The burger had bacon, Swiss, mushrooms, lettuce, and tomatoes on it. Although it had standard ingredients, it was a very tasty burger. A couple minor points for improvement would be that they cooked the patty a bit more than I would have liked, the bacon was a little too crunchy, and there could have been more cheese. Also, the ketchup in the bottle was super liquidy, which was slightly concerning.

When we arrived at the restaurant, we were confused because there was no one to greet us or guide us to a table. After waiting for a minute, we were told to just sit down at a table and wait for a waiter to come (he came after a few minutes). He was not the friendliest, but that was understandable given that he was the only waiter working at the restaurant. The service speed was pretty good. The interior of the restaurant has a classic dark tavern kind of ambiance.

Overall, the White Horse Tavern is a solid place to come for an affordable burger (mine was $11 + $1 for the sweet potato fries). I would recommend it to anyone interested in a tavern kind of vibe in the Financial District.

Love the old school neighborhood bar. They have A limited list of drafts, but they had something for everyone.
This place is simple
And good - a place that hasn't succumbed to the yuppie high end "gastro pub" or clean foodie movements. There is a warmth and family feel - it felt like a bar with family.

I ordered the burger and was very happy! It was a classic old school burger with special sauce and some shredded lettuce. This type of thing holds a special place in my heart. I also opted for the onion rings. I usually  succumb to the temptation of fries, because not that many places make good onion rings. Often I find onion rings that are some frozen food fast fryer product called onion ring.
Not these! They were hot, juicy, and have plump big slices of sweet onion. Delicious!

This is a great tavern to visit in the financial district. They have plenty of friendly faces and a great bartender. It seems like it is a regulars hang out. They have some great bar snack food including some awesome wings. They were so friendly in there that we ended up buying drinks back-and-forth with the regulars. That made us feel like we were really part of the place. Very welcoming.

The drinks were priced well, beer was cold and the food was delicious! What else can you want?

The atmosphere feels like an old Irish pub, the mixture of the work crowd, a few tourists, etc on a Monday evening was great while in route to the ferry. The pastrami Ruben was delicious, the whiskey chicken sandwich was great according to my dinner mates, so good I never even got a bite.

I stopped in with 2 coworkers for a quick drink after work. It was a little before 5pm, so it wasn't super full. We sat at the bar and ordered some well drinks. I think it was HH, so there was a discount. Drinks were good and strong.

We also ordered mozzarella sticks and onion rings. Both really hit the spot.

Bartender was nice and attentive. I'd recommend White Horse Tavern if you work in the area and are looking for a good spot for HH after work.

This place was so cute and quaint! I don't eat meat and asked about the veggie burger- they went so far as to bring me the label from the packaging so I could read the ingredients. They were just so helpful ! Also after spending exorbitant amounts of money on food in NY it was so nice to find a place that was good and didn't break the bank. Employees were all very friendly !

Great service. Family Friendly!  The burgers were good. I would pass on the brisket. Being a TEXAN I am very particular about my BBQ. The beer was cold and fries were hot and crispy.
Sorry was charging my phone when the food came.  Another great service feature.
Thanks again!

I left a review about 10 months ago, I was unhappy with my order. Frank (the owner) reached out to me and expressed his concerns and was extremely apologetic about the whole situation. He explained things to me and told me that he'd like for me to come back and offered a complimentary meal / drink for returning. The last time I went to White horse, was my last week before I resigned from working at the Statue of Liberty after 8 long years, so I had not been there since. I recently came w. an old co-worker sometime in February and I can say that the hospitality, food & drinks were fantastic. I met Frank, he is such a pleasant person and attentive to patrons needs. What I appreciated most wasn't the complimentary food but his concern to my bad experience, which most business owners tend to ignore. Frank, thank you so much for making my return worth coming back when I'm around the area.

I like coming here, simply because it's close from work and many of my co workers come to hang out for drinks. Today was different... I came w. Friends to share goodbyes and see you later so we ate there. I LOVE WINGS and my was I dissatisfied. The worse wings I've ever had in my life. They were so distasteful, bitter and raw ... I showed my boyfriend the pictures and he told me I should of sent those wings back. I had thought well maybe the first few that I ate were okay being that I was so hungry I tolerated it and once I got to that one it was just awful seeing uncooked wings.

One of the oldest bars in Manhattan, and also very reasonably priced. I was here with a long-time friend and we both really enjoyed our meals. He plays in a dart league and has played here before. It is just the perfect part divey and the perfect part historic. We had dinner here and a couple drinks. The drinks are so much less expensive than the venues over on Stone Street. Well worth a two block walk to come over here instead. It was crowded on a Friday night, but not obnoxiously so. Bartenders were slightly indifferent, but they did what they were supposed to do, and our food came out quickly. I'll be coming back here again.

After work hours for Happy Hour was desired for day's end wash out.  After reading all the reviews of their Happy Hour it was a opportunity not to be missed.  I decided on Cupcake Prosecco $8 (Italy).  Customer service is not attentive albeit it was moderately packed for a Thursday evening.  Atmosphere contains boisterously loud background music as it can be heard outside by the entrance door.  White Horse is a dive bar in the Financial District of Downtown Manhattan where many white collar workers flock here to alleviate workplace stress and pressure.

I loved this place ! Took a minute for someone to take our order. But food was good, reasonable in price . Cute little tavern!

Fish n chips was large portion for 12$.
Hubby had soup w corned beef sandwich finished it all and he normally doesn't eat sandwiches. His fav part was cheap beer! Important when your on vacation.

We would have went back but they were not open the next day.(Sat)

This has to be the worst service I've ever received. The manager was rude, condescending, and slow to even bring out water.

Fast forward to the food part of this and it was nothing less than underwhelming. The only good part of the food was the cheap price but I was more than willing to pay for better food.

Save time, money, and the pain of dealing with the staff and Eat somewhere else. New York has a ton of food places to offer.

No sign of gentrification here. They still have their fall decorations up well into November, which I appreciate
I needed a pick me up after a particularly rough afternoon at work-it's not 5pm yet, but I was in good company with a few bar flys. This is a place for jack on the rocks and beer, and I love that.

I should have known this place was going to be bad when I walked up and 4 men were literally carrying a guy out because he was incoherent. I decided to take a chance because I was hungry and wanted to wet my whistle with a good beer.

Upon arriving we were not greeted by anyone and made our own way to a table. We sat for about 7 minutes before the waitress/bar tender came over. She was soft spoken and hard to understand because it was so loud in the bar. I ordered a Brooklyn Pilsner to try the beers of NYC and at first I thought she got it wrong because she was mumbling. She did get the right order but it took another 7 minutes just to bring it over.

As for food, we ordered the sampler platter and the white horse burger. I have to admit the fried Mac and cheese is AMAZING!!!! These are a must have if you decide to step into this place after reading my review. Burger was average, chicken fingers were sauce-less, and everything else was average. The wings were the worst thing I ever ate, and I'm not just saying that because I'm from Buffalo. They didn't even look like wings and they were soooo undercooked! My husband was actually afraid he was going to get sick! We weren't able to tell our waitress because she NEVER came to check on us!!!! Terrible terrible service! Once the waitress came over, when we were ready to leave, we showed her the raw, bloody wings and she seemed disinterested and unconcerned about it. She did not offer to replace or comp any portion of our check. When we went to pay, we took our own check up to the bar because we couldn't stand to wait anymore. I would never come back.

I ordered at the counter for to go - and it took about 15 mins.  I just wanted brisket and I believe they charged me for the deli sandwich which was around $6 plus tax.  I got some fatty pieces and some leaner pieces, so it was a perfect variety.  Super tender and delicious.  It was pretty packed but I went on a Friday around 1pm.

I would recommend this place for their lunch specials, or a quick drink at their bar.  The bar looked fully loaded!

Pretty cool spot in FiDi. Some people call it a dive bar, but I'd say their menu and layout is more like a laid back restaurant. Stopped in here for lunch right as they opened last week and was happy with the choice. Was looking for a nice quiet place to have a meeting and this was the perfect spot.

We both ordered sandwiches, and were pretty satisfied. I will say the roast beef I had was a little dry, but the flavor was there.

Main takeaways from this place were that it is far from what you'd expect in lower Manhattan if you're an outsider. Prices were cheap and the atmosphere feels much different than being in a big city. We didn't drink, but it seems like a good spot to come for cheap drinks during happy hour.  Looking forward to coming back next time I'm in the area.

Came to check it out and it was very chill at when beginning, bartender was not attentive to what I order so she got my drink wrong twice and after she realized she said it was "on her". Whatever, counted how many beers I had. Then just sitting there I felt water dripping down my back. The guy next to me (a stranger) push me out of the way before water starts to pour down from the ceiling, my jacket got wet but whatever it dryers fast. My back was wet and I think some people next to me (whom I think are the owners) said "oh I know what it is".  I didn't care, it just took me by surprise. I just hope it wasn't toilet water cuz I still had a couple of places to go. Well they said this was a place to visit. Eh it was okay. Besides getting a shower bartenders should be nicer and maybe check on pluming ever now and then. (Btw she did charge me the "on me" beers)

I like honesty. I had the chicken tenders with a salad mix thing on the side- it was nice to have an option as opposed to having fries thrown at my face. Bill total, with apple cider? $14.00 A manhattan deal, if there is one. Also, they have real honey mustard. None of that Kens dressing packet business here.

I've come here a few times.  It's about what you would expect from an Irish pub with a few nice surprises.

For the food menu, they have your typical burgers, shepherd's pie, and fish & chips.  They have some interesting varieties of burgers that have some unexpected flavors for an Irish pub.

In addition to the typical American mainstream beers, they also have a number of craft beers from the region.

The service is decent.  They're not super attentive, but they are friendly.  My last time there, the bartender was all alone and the tables were pretty much full of large parties and the bar was pretty full, too.  He was doing his best, but he certainly needed a server to help out.

This is a tavern in FiDi that is frequented by both locals and people who work in the area. The bartender that we were chatting with was awesome. She has this no-frills kind of attitude and sarcastic humor that is really cool. She's Irish so she has an amazing accent.

We came in for what is known as the special - which is 1 can of PBR and 1 shot of your choosing for $5. The shots are pretty big. Worth the money.

The interior has a warm and cozy feeling. Will be returning.

We were looking for a place to have lunch after visiting the Statue of Liberty while in town. Decided this looked like a great local experience and kept with our "no chain food" during our trip.

Loved the look and feel as soon as we walked in, truly feels like an old tavern.

My roast beef sandwich was great, perfectly cooked. Wife had a BLT that she really enjoyed and my son had a burger which was also executed well. No complaints about the food at all.

Where i had to take off points:

Not the friendliest staff in the world. When we walked in and asked if we should seat ourselves, the bartender just waved his arms and said "open seating..."

Same with taking our order, just didn't really seem interested. We were quite obviously tourists ( was carrying a camera bag, my son wearing a hat that gave it away...) and he made no effort to engage us at all. Maybe if we were regulars it would've been different, but I didn't really see the staff engaging as we sat there eating our lunch.

Second...we ordered sodas and i'm pretty sure my mouth fell open when he sat cans down on the table with cups of ice.

Neither of those are huge, they're not deal breakers for me, but...enough to knock a couple of stars off.

If you're in the financial district/battery park area and looking for a good tavern/bar where you can get a good bite, be left alone, this is your place. I would certainly go back for another try if I was in the area.

Came with kids after NYC tourist trip to Statue of Liberty.  Excellent, quick and friendly service.  Food was great, beer selection was solid and place was calm and not too crazy for a Friday before noon.  History is permeating from the walls, but not too dreary.  Waitress was kind and owner came by to check on us.

I am a big fan of old, divey bars and I love that this kind of bar still exists. The prices are the most affordable in the area, the food is pretty dang good for dive bar pub fare (get the rueben) and I am glad places like this still exist in the city.

Is it fancy? No. Is it innovative? No. Is it cheap and unpretentious? Yes, and I love it!

I came here with my coworkers to say farewell to a leaving coworker! Definitely not a place to come for a quiet talk over drinks. It was super, super packed and loud! They have great deals on drinks, and their food is pretty standard. Classic bar food -- we got the sampler platter and fries! The fries were not as crisp as I would have liked -- but they came out hot!

We were unsure at first but this place was great for lunch! We went with a large party and kids and it was a good experience.

The burgers and fish and chips were stellar. Really great bar food at reasonable prices.

The service was dry but very attentive and nice. We enjoyed our visit! The building seemed historic and had been there for over a century!

Great stop after Battery park. We highly recommend.

To be honest id pass on the food, there aint nothing spectacular here about the food. but in this area, youll get cheap prices on drinks. i was a little surprised by the house tequila, it was good. not sure what it was, but ill take another shot. also the choices on draft were a little more variety than i would have thought. plenty of tables to sit at, second floor, and bathrooms are spotless.

We hopped off the Staten Island Ferry and walked a block and stumbled upon this tavern.
It was pretty packed but we had great service and got our food quickly.
The food was delicious! I had a grilled cheese and soup and my husband had fish & chips. Excellent!
Definitely will return.
