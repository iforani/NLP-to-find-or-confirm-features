I went for a friend's birthday. It was so much fun. It's a nice, chill spot to hang out with friends.

I love Kick Axe. I love it because I love to axe throwing.

I went to a fellow Yelpers axe throwing bio celebration back in February and since then I was hooked. Since that one time I've tried another ace throwing location that I will not name and it was not up to par.

My coworkers organized a group event here at kick axe and I fell in love.

The decor, the instructors, the cleanliness of the location and the fact that they change the boards often is what sold me.

The pricing per session is about $38/39 for 1.5 hours. If you have a larger group (12) you'll receive your own lane. Light snacks (pizza) is sold here and they have lots of beer and canned Rosé. Unfortunately it is not BYOB like other axe throwing locations but the drink prices are reasonable.

I've been here probably 4 times in the last year and I recently celebrated my birthday with a group of 23 other friends here. I wanted to share my love of axe throwing with my closest friends.

The only complaint I have about this location is the fact that there are no fans or some kind of air conditioning system. I've been here in just about every season and I'm always sweating. Granted yes I'm performing a physical activity but there is never any air circulation. Besides that this place is perrdr to me.

I will 100% return for more axe throwing and who knows maybe I'll join a league or something.

Who knew throwing axes would be so much fun? Initially, I thought it would be difficult but I got the hang of it pretty fast. I think axe throwing might be my calling in life. We registered online and signed waivers as soon as we entered. They have a bar, snacks, and Table 87 pizza while you wait.

The instructors we had were pretty nice and encouraging. Some of the target boards were in pretty bad shape which affected whether or not our axe throws stuck to the board or not, I think. Also, it can get loud and cramped. Also, unless you have a group of 8 or more, you probably have to share two lanes with another group.

They make competitions out of each round and it's pretty fun. I would totally do this again.

I had tons of fun here. All you need is an open mind and enjoy friendly competition. It's like darts but with axes. The cost to play is $35 per person. You can have a group of no more than 12 on a range. That will allow the trainer to break you up into two teams for the games. I have to say, getting the axe to stick in the wood was a challenge, but with practice I definitely got better. The trainer is with you the entire time to give pointers, ensure you are safe and to keep score.

The more people playing the tighter the waiting area on the range becomes. Therefore you can't have any issues with close quarters. Lol.

Kick axe has a bar and offers some food, like pizza.

The main waiting area has some couches, jenga, and connect four.

I went on a Saturday at 7:00 and it was pretty busy.

I think it's worth a try. I only gave 4 stars bc of the time allotments. It's either 1 hour and 15 min or 2 hours and 45min. I feel like I could've used another 1/2 hour on my reservation but the almost 3 hours would've been way too long.

Had a great time bringing a party of 16 first timers (including myself) to Kick Axe this past weekend!

We had to arrive a little early to sign waivers (doesn't take long), and waited with our buzzer until it was our turn. We booked two ranges and had ample time to throw axes which was nice because we had a little corner of the area to ourselves.

The staff were extremely friendly and carefully walked us through do's, dont's on axe throwing and tbh, throwing axe is actually a lot harder than I thought haha

We also played two games to spice things up a bit and definitely got us motivated to get better at axe throwing. The bar was also a great additional to our experience and definitely would come back again.

Great place to have events. The event is fun in which you and your party play at least three round of games against each other. The instructor will use the initial round to teach the party on how to throw axes and proper postures for throwing axes. Later rounds are for fine tuning and to find the best process, force, and dynamic to throw axes. I can see this event as team building event and to build some competition : )

The only con of this place is that they turned the AC so high that it was very cold inside. The super cold feeling wasn't enjoyable... Everything else was fine

One of my favorite unique activities to date! Great beer, good snacks, and AXE THROWING!

For $35pp, you get 75 minutes at the "range" with an axe throwing specialist. My boyfriend and I were paired with another couple, and we had a blast. The axe specialist taught us safety and proper throwing techniques for the first few minutes, we had a few practice throws, and then we played games! The axe specialist monitors the games: Who can get to 60 points first, "21," and "Around the World." The time flew by so fast while playing games.

The bar is awesome! They serve my favorite cider, "Austin Eastciders!" There are also some tasty looking bar snacks.

The interior is rustic meets outdoorsy. Wear your plaid shirts!! There's a cool Photobooth area with great props, Giant Jenga, and Giant Connect 4!

Parking can be a little rough since it's street parking, but it's nothing like trying to find parking in Manhattan.

What a fun time!

I wasn't sure about axe throwing at first... but I'm always down to try something new and my friends wanted to go so it was perfect when they set it all up.  I believe I paid $38 bucks

We went on Friday night and it was actually really busy!

Although I didn't set it up -my friend did who made reservations ahead of time

They tell you to come in 20mins earlier than your time slot to sign paperwork etc

You get a staff member per each group who instructs you, keeps score and helps make sure everyone is safe.

Ax throwing was easier and more fun than I thought!

We played 3 games for our group of 10 and used two booths. Area to place drinks , sit and hang coats/purses

They tell you to bring closed shoes - if not they have shoes to borrow ( ehh) .... just wear sneakers or something lol . Wear comfortable clothes . I had to take my hat off because it was getting in the way of me throwing

My throws at the end were so much better than my original throws

Our staff member Chip was awesome! He was friendly and helped us be safe. He have tips on how to throw better!

You could get drinks and food if you want....
I didn't because I knew we were going to grab dinner and drinks after

Inside was cute ... like a trendy lumberjack lodge lol

You can play games and take photos in the waiting area

They have several bathroom stalls

I really had a good time.... actually better than I thought . Would definitely try it again.

This is a lot of fun! I've never done this before and found the experience really well run, educational, and a great group activity. Also they do a great job making sure this is safe, after a couple throws you won't feel nervous at all.

Throwing the axe  is different than you would expect. It's not a sport where you want to use a lot of power, you actually do better throwing slowly and gently. I guess this is a bit like darts.

Each ally gets a host who runs a series of games. The games can be 21, where you have to get exactly 21 points to win, or just first team to 40 points. The host we had was really funny and helped us learn how to throw better by constantly giving us pointers.

There's a full bar and food available at the facility  as well.

Definitely give it a shot if you have a group that wants to have an interesting evening!

This place is wonderful, I came here with a group of friends for a birthday, 13 people in total. Being the unorganized group of people that we all, we all bought our tickets online separately. Fearing we would have been with a random group, I called to ask them if we could be grouped. They let us know that adding a hostname in the checkout will let them know the party is together.

The atmosphere was fun, we got there around 10 PM for our 10:30 appointment. It was super packed but after a while, the rush started to leave. They have a bar there which is awesome, they also have some seating near the entrance with board games and a giant connect four.

The event lasts for about an hour and 15 mins. Our instructor (Will) was super awesome and gave us a safety demo and we had some practice runs before the games began. Overall it was a great time and a very enjoyable experience will go back again.

I went here for my friends 30th birthday! This place is awesome! This place is also pretty well organized.

I walked here from atlantic terminal, it took about 10 minutes (pretty convenient for fellow mta riders).

They have a cute outdoor area that we did not take advantage of since the weather was very cold but it had a huge bull and some nice high top tables to hang out at.( maybe I'll be back in the summer next).

Inside the team welcomes you and assists you in finding an iPad and signing there waver. Then you can have a beer or cider and lounge on one of the couches or tables. Or maybe take pics with some props while you wait for your session to begin. This was great for us since we had a big group of 21. They even had board games like jenga.

This spot has light food like pizza and a great array of craft beer. Got your safety don't drink too much, I just had one cider here.

Then for the best part we got 4 lanes since we were a big group and got to throw axes! Throwing an axe is quite challenging and even when you think you got the hang of it you might still strike out the next time. We had a blast learning how to throw and competing in the different array of games they set up for us to keep us motivated to win. Our instructors were great and kept everything lively, light and fun.

Kick Axe thanks for making my friends 30th a night to remember. I will definitely be back in the near future to throw again!

Who knew throwing axes could be so fun. Not only was it a great time but I also feel like I'm very prepared in the event of a zombie apocalypse. Ax will probably be my weapon of choice.
To get your ax throwing experience started you sign up online (and pay) for the day and time you want. Online you can see how many slots are available per time slot. I recommend not waiting until the last minute to book because you're preferred time may be full. They recommend You get there early to sign a waiver.
Each session is 90 minutes and the entire time you have an ax-pert with you. Teaching you how to throw, giving your pointers, leading the games and keeping score. I've done this twice so far and it's so much fun. Don't forget to tip your axpert.

So this was an outing with my staff and it was and good gathering with not a lot of pressure. I wish they had more snack or food options but despite that it was a good spot. It was a tad bit warm I know it's cold outside right now but I need venues in general in NY to understand when everyone is inside and throwing objects the are gonna g wet hot. Please keep it cool And comfortable and not a toaster inside.

Our coach Jared was awesome super personable and nice. He helped everyone get their optimum throwing abilities so we could have the most fun.

Very busy place. Stopped by here one Sunday afternoon with a group of 6. Reservations are made prior and payment is required during that time (we paid $38/per).
They paired us up with an Australian family and gave us a guide. Every group has a guide to avoid injuries and they never leave you.
He'll spend some time explaining how to properly throw the hatchet, where to stand, hand position and such. He'll then ask everyone to try to get a feel of it. Throwing hatchets is something that gets easier the more you do it.  So we practiced for a bit then competed with the Australian family.
Food wise we o lot had some beers and this weird hot chocolate drink in a can that tastes pretty good. I think it's from Belgium and they know chocolate so no wonder it was good.

Overall, I'll come here again. Good atmosphere and vibe for some fun.

I dig it, if you axed me.

Space is "cool" and rustic - basically bare bones but still clean and comfortable. They have plenty of ranges but it gets REALLY loud. It's really fun depending on your group. The axeperts are friendly, professional, fun and helpful. With a big group, it DOES go by quick and you don't throw as much but it's still a good amount to try and to get better. Once you get the hang of the throw and start hitting some targets, it feels awesome. The space also has a lounge area w games if you wanted to chill after or before.

They don't sell hard liquor but have some beers and seltzer's and wine.

All staff is knowledgeable and you feel safe (somewhat...) ;)

Good time all around!

A friend of mine wanted to mix things up from the norm for his birthday so he decided we should hurl axes in hipster Brooklyn. I'd been here before and thought this was a great idea for a social way to spend some time with a group of friends where we weren't made to scream over club/bar music or be confronted with sitting at a table limiting who we interacted with.

We had a little area to ourselves right up front and had a fun ax-master who led us through a few games. Alcoholic drinks are only served one-at-a-time which is a somewhat annoying policy when we're trying to play a game and are time-constrained. Snack food choices are very limited, but it works because there's a Dinosaur BBQ a couple of blocks away that's a perfect next stop from here.

The only real gripe one can have is paying $35+tax+tip per person to our ax-master in a group of 8 where the pressure seems to be "on" to try to get adequate value out of the 75 minute "lane" rental. The price per person should probably scale differently when there are so many people on a lane.

Anyway, fun place with a good energy. I'd recommend it, but definitely make a reservation for prime nights/weekends because you'll need it.

I've never thrown an axe in my life, but thanks to Kick Axe Throwing, I can actually say I've not only done it but I love it. I am not saying I have a natural affinity to throwing these axes, but somehow I find the whole process quite therapeutic. They are pioneers for the NYC area and easily among the best at it.

Prior to this amazing Brooklyn spot, I had never heard of axe throwing as a thing. Fast forward close to a year later, there are places opening up left and right with the same premise and now there's even a Yelp dedicated category just for these types of businesses.

I don't think one should ever come here without a decent group of people. It's a great way to bond with others, a fun nightlife oriented activity that is beyond the bar (though they do serve adult beverages!), and great way to destress.

A few tips:

* First timer? Don't worry, there is always a staff person monitoring the space and will act both as an instructor and referee for games.

* Try to show up on time, preferably 15 minutes prior. Paying $35 a person and only throwing an axe for a short time can be a real drag.

* Groups of 16 will always get their own exclusive area. Smaller groups might be combined with others. Nothing beats networking over axe throwing.

* Drinking is not going to help one's game, but it's fun anyway. Food is also available, but outside catering is okay as long as it's been pre-arranged with their special events coordinator.

Love Love Love this place!
.
If you're looking for a date night activity, just a casual hang out with family & friends or celebrating something that's filled with a rush of adrenaline & fun, @kickaxethrowing is definitely a must do
.
The kick axe sessions have their Pros that teach the basics for about 10-15 minutes and then you get to compete in some fun games against your friends or enemies. The Axe Pro is with you throughout the experience to assist and help keep score.
.
The ambiance is like a cozy cabin with a bar to grab drinks at, couches to chill on & props to dress up as vikings to take pics in Either way, it def worth checking out at least once!

What a fantastic location.  Kick Axe Throwing is VERY well taken care of establishment.  From the second you walk in to the minute you walk out you are surrounded by exactly what you think you would be.  Wood, beer, and fabulous fabric, deer heads, and lots of 10" pizza options for $14 each.

Don't have enough people in your group to start a tournament? No problem! Kick Ass Throwing will assemble a tourney for you!

1. Price: $$-$$$
2. Tipping $: Remember to bring cash to bring your "Axepert" or individual who leads your tournament. There is no where for you to leave a credit card tip!
3. Food: 10" Pizza's and snacks galore!
4. Beer/Wine: Great list of beers and wines to enjoy while you're kicking axe.  You CAN drink while you throw!
5. MUST WEAR CLOSED TOED SHOES.  If you do not they have bins of shoes labeled, "shoes of shame" that you are welcome to.  No one is turned away.  The shoes of shame aren't fashionable but they are comfortable!  If you're coming from the office in heals- fear not!

Overall, a great place for a birthday, bachelorette or bachelor party, or a night out after a long day at the office.  Two axes up!!

Axe me how I like it... I loved this!! I've heard of people doing this more often lately and glad I tried it! It's super fun, I did need to get the hang of it and didn't get the board the first few times. But they walk you through it, the instructors are engaging enough for needing to walk you through demos and safety rules, and they give you tips to help you throw better. You don't get any safety gear and our group did have a couple times where the axe kinda bounced back toward you. but it wasn't really that dangerous, at least imo. No one got hurt or even close! Overall I thought it was a really fun activity, good for team building and friendly competition, but the time does go by quick!!

My office came here for a team outing last week and had a blast! I don't venture out to Brooklyn much and have never gone anywhere other than Williamsburg, but I enjoyed the hike over. The outside of the space looks super cool with a little patio and painted garage doors.

As soon as I stepped inside, I was transported to a lodge style setting and was immediately greeted by the sounds of axe throwing, something else I'd never ventured into. Our group signed our waivers, headed in to nosh on the cold and stale lunches we unfortunately did not get to eat in the office, and listened as the axe pros laid down the rules and explained the games and techniques.

We split up into 3 ranges and played amongst our groups with our axe pro encouraging and roasting us all the same the whole time. It was a great time and definitely a fun bonding experience!

There's not much that I love more than getting drunk and flinging very sharp, heavy objects around. I used to just do it at my home and the homes of various friends...but since some of us have had children, we've started throwing the children instead, and throwing knives and such has fallen a bit by the wayside.

Luckily, Kick Axe is here for me.

It's just a good time. The space is comfortable, large, well-decorated in contemporary log-cabin chic, and perfect for throwing some axes. If you've never been, there will be an axpert ready to show you how to do it. After a little instruction, you'll be able to show your friends how much more valuable you'd be in a zombie apocalypse.

You definitely have to reserve some space beforehand because they are just about always busy. I would also recommend showing up on time as opposed to getting too drunk at dinner and only having about 15 minutes when you paid for an hour, but that's your call. You might be better off just bringing in Dinosaur BBQ or something else from down the street, as opposed to trying to wrangle your irresponsible friends into a certain place at a certain time.

If I have one complaint, it's that it's beer/wine only, and that they only allow you to grab one at a time. That last part may only have been for us though, as SOMEONE was visibly drunk.

It may have been me.

Came here with a group of friends in July to celebrate my friend's birthday.  Even though I arrived late, I was able to join my group.  The instructor gave me instructions on how to throw the ax and retrieve it safely.  We had so much fun.  They had food and adult beverages also.  This is definitely a fun activity.

Came here with large group and I gotta say this place is so much fun. Kick Axe is friggin amazing. Definitely have to book before hand to reserve a spot for your group. Once you arrive with you entire party, you guys get situated in your area and every group gets a great "axer-pert" axe thrower who does a stellar job explaining the do's and don'ts of axe throwing. The instructors are comical but they stress the importance of safety so you don't get hurt. Other than that they give you a quick lesson on how to properly throw and axe and you are one your way to an hour of a hella good time.

You play various games through the hour of axe throw. All the games rely on scoring points on the axe board, kinda like darts, except this is a huge knarly axe you chuck at this wooden bullseye.

Honestly a great spot to hang with friends and have a fun/unique axe throwing experience. There's also a bar! so drink responsibly and have a great time!

Fun fun fun! This was my first time ever doing anything like this. I had no idea where I was going so I came pretty dressed up. Thought my heels would hold me back but once you view my pics and videos, you'll see that I dont play around when it comes to challenges lol

Ronnie (I hope that is his name) rocked! He had alot of energy and kept us all entertained. I was  nervous at first but once I got the hang of things no one could stop me. Shout out to my personal coach who gave me extra tips (Kei)  I ended up winning!!

There are couches around the place where you can lounge around until it's your time to play. We played jenga while we waited. I believe there were other little games to play too. This is a must. Probably better to go with a group but 1 on 1 was perfect too. They will put you in a group even if you came with 1other person. There are a few different challenges they set you up to do. Everyone gets to practice a few times, then the fun begins. Our little VIP area was cool.

There are no cocktail drinks- just beers and wines.

There aren't many activities that are both fun and preparation for the end of the world. But throwing axes is definitely one of them.

To be honest, I thought it was just a fad, but judging by the gigantic corporate crowd on a Friday afternoon, they're still doing great! I'm guessing this constant sense of impending doom has something to do with it.

I was here around when they first opened for a Yelp Event (read my thoughts here: yelp.com/biz/elite-event…), and it's still as fun as I remembered.

Every time I tell people about this place, their reaction is always "axes and alcohol shouldn't mix". But guess what? They do! Luckily, they also have safety precautions to prevent accidents. Trust your axpert! Ours was Tom, and he was a cool dude.

Speaking of drinks, they got beers and now they have this weird thing that's whatever the opposite of a refrigerator is. A heater? I dunno, but you can get canned hot chocolate or canned hot coffee. I went with their Stumptown cold brew, which was a whopping $7.50 for an 8 oz can. Luckily, it was on the work tab!

Also because it was a work event, I won't begrudge them for being successful. But the groups next to us were gigantic and kept encroaching into our space.

The one thing I will fault them for was our board was pretty torn up before we started, and because we're so talented, we basically destroyed the bullseye and could no longer reasonably hit any halfway through. They definitely replace them often (we could see/hear them drilling nonstop for the first 10-15 minutes we were there), so I guess we got the short end of that stick.

But all in all, a fun place to bring a group!

Four stars for the fun, three for the food and beer selection.  All in, I definitely had a fun time and want to go again, but it's fairly pricey, and then they want tips at the end as well.  Don't see that changing, however, as it was crazy busy.

The venue itself can accomodate a lot of throwers, and does so in a way that seems as safe as a venue where you throw axes could be. It was hard to move around, however. The axes are in good shape, easy to throw (seemed like everyone playing had at least intermittent success/bullseyes), and our "Axpert" who stayed with us and coached /refereed the entire time was very helpful and nice.

The food...? We had a pizza, and it was expensive, tiny and terrible.  Not just mediocre...terrible.  Notably worse than frozen pizza from the grocery store. I imagine no one ever orders a second..

The beer selection had quite a few options, but mostly ones for a younger crowd.  I would like to have seen some more local Brooklyn options as well.

TRUST ME, JUST DO IT.

I promise you won't regret it, and you're bound to have a great time. The venue used to be a performance space called Littlefield a couple years ago, and I love what Kick Axe Throwing has done with it in terms of décor! Very warm, rustic interior. Perfect for a wintertime date.

You must purchase a reservation in advance, and once you're there an "Axepert" will go through the safety policies and teach you the appropriate axe-throwing techniques. Afterwards, your group will be split into two for some fun games. For amount of time spent, you definitely get your money's worth.

Plenty of craft beers available, and a comfy lounge with board/card games to play if you still want to hang out afterwards. I highly recommend if you're the competitive type, enjoy novelty activities, or just want to do something a little different!

We had a great time. It was my friends birthday and we came here to celebrate on a rainy Monday night. Lawrence was great. He was able to teach us very well and we all enjoyed our time there. It was fun because they had different rounds and different rules for each round. He was super funny and chill and definitely had a great time. Would come back and recommend!

I'd never heard about this until my husband came home from his trip to NYC and told me about this place that someone took him out to.

Great place to hang out with friends or big parties! There were only 4 of us, so we got 2 other people joining our group.

First we signed the waiver and ordered our drinks then the instructor came to collect us and took us to the the area. I've got to say, our instructor was SO hilarious while half the time being super serious while giving us instructions and tips. We were divided into 2 teams and I did pretty well a couple of times. We had a lot of laughs and giggles. I didn't drink much because I was really worried I could have hurt myself, but it was really safe!

I would definitely do it again if I'm in the area. I mean, when you're in Brooklyn, don't miss out on the Axe Throwing shenanigan!

This place is not too far from the subways. It's in the walking distance. Also, you can easily walk from Park Slope, get food there and come here, just like we did!

What a blast! My boyfriend and I went on a surprise date after finding them on Groupon and had so much fun! We were there early in the morning and so our session was just us and we had so much fun! We played games, competed, laughed, listened to music! We didn't have food or snacks there but everything was clean and the employees were great and answering all question. We felt safe throughout the time there and we did not have a single issue. Highly recommend and would absolutely come again

I am so happy that this place was open and we were able to celebrate my husband's birthday. It was safe and clean. We had to wear masks the entire time unless we wanted to take a sip of our drinks. We had an amazing instructor as well. Definitely would recommend as something fun and unique to do.

The only reason this place has "good reviews" is because the company freaks out if they get a bad one and try to bribe the customers to removing/changing their post.

Its expensive, crowded, loud, and the entire experience is rushed.
The staff looks miserable screaming the same stupid script over the noise/shitty music - management looks inexperienced.
All they care about is money. they book as much as possible and don't even have time to change the beat up boards which makes it impossible to stick the axe

They have a decent selection of beer but the "snacks" are a joke.
They have a microwave at the bar!!!! LOL

I've been encouraging my friends, family and coworkers to not give them business.  Just a bunch of Caucasian transplants appealing to the other NY transplants. It's like a scene out of Get Out the second you walk in there. Corny decor, stupid props, overpriced everything and fake smiles.
Will never give my money to this place again, there are far better establishments (more rustic, not "pretty") Support NON gentrified businesses.
