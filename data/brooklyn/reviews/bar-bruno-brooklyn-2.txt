This restaurants food was exceptional however their portions were small they still made the food look appetizing in to go containers for COVID. However the restaurants staff were horrible time wise and service delays are understandable but unpleasant. Would recommend if you have a lot of time to wait.

NA Critic Score: 7/10

I'm so glad they're still open during this pandemic. Super friendly staff, lots of plants between tables helping social distancing and it looks so beautiful.
The burgers were absolutely delicious!
Great experience!!!!

Grabbed dinner here with an old friend around 5:30pm on a Friday night and the outdoor seating area already looked packed! Despite that, the waiter was able to seat us right away. They used plants to help social distance the tables, which also made it seem like we were in our own world.

I ordered the grilled shrimp tacos and my friend ordered the battered fish tacos. We also ordered shishito peppers to share. I got a strawberry juice (didn't know that was a thing) and my friend ordered a mango margarita. I didn't see any happy hour specials as an FYI.

The waiter that served our food wore a mask and gloves which I appreciated. My shrimps tacos were well seasoned and cole slaw and mango salsa elevated the flavors. I tried the fish taco but unfortunately it was lacking in taste. The shishito peppers were pretty good but a bit oily in my opinion. My strawberry juice was good but it wasn't anything special. My friend said her margarita was strong

It started to rain and the little awning didn't help cover both of us, but I scooted in. It was nice watching the rain and catching up. Overall, my food was pretty good and the prices were decent ($14 for 3 tacos)! I enjoyed my visit here and would recommend the shrimp tacos if you go! (:

I travel often and love trying different places with good reviews. I'm also a business owner and look at different things while in restaurants.

First, chips and salsa. Stale chips and a much different salsa. Then the food. Mediocre. I got a chicken platter as recommended, my husband got steak tacos, and my cousin had a burger. The fact my plate was $23 was insulting. No flavor.

Bathrooms were gross, during Covid especially I think this is huge.

I remember the day that I discovered Bar Bruno like it was yesterday...Ok, so it was actually last week -lol. Either way, it was truly magical the way that I found Bar Bruno on social media, began salivating at the food + beverage pictures and quickly ordered take-out via delivery.com. Everything looked so good that I only made it to Carroll Park and quickly sat down before devouring the Bar Bruno Fish Tacos and my Margarita. Now, that I got that out of the way. Let me describe my experience at Bar Bruno....

Bar Bruno is a Mexican restaurant located in the Carroll Gardens section of Brooklyn.  I ordered my food to be picked-up by 1:30pm which gave me enough time to take the G train to Carroll St. Station and walk the multiple blocks to the establishment. Once I arrived, it was pleasant to see that they have outdoor dining consisting of several tables and plants around the seating areas. Bartender Sabrina kindly greeted me and handed me my to-go order that was on the counter. Scanning the bar area inside caused me to see a cocktail/wine menu near some frozen beverage machines. After inquiring about the various drinks, Sabrina mentioned that Bar Bruno makes frozen margaritas, mezcal drinks, etc. She also explained that flavors can be added to the frozen drinks....Yes to that! Sabrina made me the best Blueberry, Strawberry and Pineapple Frozen Margarita Ever!!!  Great Food and Great Drinks!

Fast Forward to 7/20 and I decided to have us come here for my birthday dinner. We sat at the outdoor table that is by itself around the corner from the other tables which made me feel comfortable. We ordered Fish Tacos, Carnitas (Pork) Tacos, Tater Tots, Side Orders of Rice + Beans, a Quinoa Veggie Burger, Grilled Zucchini, etc.  The tacos and burger were flavorful and Mango Margarita was nice and sweet. I had another Blueberry, Strawberry and Pineapple frozen Margarita like I had the other day and it tasted amazing!

Due to the Pandemi/Health Crisis, Bar Bruno will continue to offer outdoor dining as well as the option for patrons to pick-up and take-out their food/beverage orders. Every staffperson wore masks, gloves and our dining food, cocktails and plastic utensils were served in disposable packaging like cartons, plastic, etc which was much appreciated to promote cleanliness. Thanks to all of the hardworking individuals at Bar Bruno for giving me a nice to-go order and a lovely birthday outdoor dining experience!

You will find high quality drinks here! I ordered their passionfruit, blueberry, and pineapple margaritas and loved them all. They were excellently prepared by Sabrina - tasty, refreshing, and FUN.

The staff are communicative and chill people. There is a new gov regulation requiring food to be purchased along with an order containing drinks. They respectfully explained and we got habanero wings, which were very good as well.

I recommend Bar Bruno for margarita fans who want an awesome bar with fun cocktails and excellent staff.

Went to Bar Bruno on August 8th  with a friend after an intense day of shopping at IKEA. Had to wait about 30 minutes to get an outside seat due to COVID restrictions.

Once seated, my friend and I ordered. We couldn't decide on drinks so we got to taste their cucumber based frozen drink. Even though it was very refreshing, we decided to go with more fruit based margaritas instead. We also shared some wings, which were really good.

My lunch was corn and chicken quesadillas. Both were really good and tasty. Had some quesadillas to go home with and eat later.

Staff were friendly and very helpful.

Bar Bruno is an excellent neighborhood restaurant and bar.  Located at the corner of Henry & Union Streets in Carroll Gardens, it seems always busy.  Still a table seems to always be found. Only a block from my family's home, it is a regular spot for us to eat.

Enter to a busy bar area.  Tables are in the bar area or further back, away from the noise.  Sidewalk tables are available for warmer times.  The decor is modern and clean.  The music was nice.  I heard songs from my generation, which is a definite plus.

Mexican with additions of American can be found on the menu.  The food is excellent, both well prepared and presented.

My favorite is the Bruno Burrito, which has just the right mix of rice, beans & tomato.  Addition choices are available.  My pick is always carnitas.  It makes for the perfect burrito.  The side salad that comes with the burrito is yummy.

My grandson loves the Skirt Steak with fries and veggies grilled on a skewer.  They also have Vegan options, which appeal to my son.

For dinner or drinks in the neighborhood, it's hard to beat Bar Bruno.

The area, outdoor dining setup & the staff are appeasing but the food wasn't to my expectation. The food was a little bland & the Mezca tequila they use for their drink is not my preference.

So I was trying to have a spontaneous night with my friends and the waiter was very rude and hostile. In between our meals he never took the initiative to check on us and later pasted a snorky remark  saying we should've came sooner . In addition, our food were cold and insipid. I am totally disappointed.

I love this place! Not only is the food delicious but the staff are amazing. They have outdoor seating with plenty of room between the tables & chairs (social distance). The staff wear mask & gloves at all times & are all very attentive to the customers. This place is a win win, you'll get great food, great customer service and the drinks DELICIOUS! I recommend the frozen passion fruit margarita, it's so tasty. Thank me later, lol!

The food, drinks and service was pretty good. We tried their guacamole with chips which was different with nuts in it, chicken quesadilla and their Bruno Diaz Burger, all pretty good. The drinks were a bit expensive ($17) but strong, with high quality tequila

I reluctantly write a negative review during the pandemic but I really felt taken here. Dirty tables, staff could not be bothered to clean between customers? Even with Covid? Ordered rare burger which came out medium well with a slice of inedible tomato and greasy, soggy fries. Oh, and served in take out containers that are awkward to eat from. A paper plate would have been better. Sorry, but there are many other struggling restaurants that appreciate your business.

Bar Bruno is a fun, festive, casual Mexican eatery.  The bar serves high-quality drinks, the food was spot-on, and our waitress was incredibly friendly.  What's not to like?

We started out with an order of the Guacamole.  Really solid dish with unique ingredients (pumpkin seed) and spices (unknown) vs. the traditional overpowering flavor of lime, jalapeno, and sea salt (get's boring after a while, folks).  The homemade chips were delicious, thick, and extra-crunchy.

Next up, we split an order of the Fish and Shrimp Taco's (three per order).  The portion sizes were impressive and the seafood was perfectly cooked.  We opted for a side of french fries (yum) and rice.  The rice was ridiculously fluffy, with crunchy bits reminiscent of socarrat mixed in.

An all-around great dining experience.  Plus, Bar Bruno serves Pacifico on tap!  Which is kind of cool, since I've never seen this on the East Coast.

It's such a cute spot. Great for a date. The outside seating and vibes are nice and romantic. The food is great too! Service was a little disorganized but I don't expect too much considering the circumstances with Covid and changing guidelines. Loved the hibiscus margs and kale dip!!

Tried them for take out, this was not a sit down meal. The food is good, the staff was very mice. I hope to come back and have a sit down meal in the future so I can provide more information.

The one good thing is if you want delivery you don't have to use Seamless or Grubhub so you can speak to a person. Many of the other restaurants in the area are very impersonal when it comes to delivery or take out. I would recommend Bar Bruno.

I'm very sad to write this review.  I've been to Bar Bruno several times over the years and it has always been great.  The food, atmosphere, the staff-a perfect local hangout.  Sunday afternoon, I had lunch with my friend.  She ordered the pulled pork tacos, margarita and the spicy chicken wings.  We shared the chips and salsa.  I ordered the kale salad with shrimp, Rose and the tortilla soup.  We ate half our meal and brought the rest home.  Later that evening, we had the rest of our food for dinner.  I had a chicken wing and a pulled pork taco, but she didn't have my tortilla soup or my kale salad.  *The only other thing I had that day was a Nespresso coffee.

The reason I'm writing this is because at 1:30am I woke up with SEVERE food poisoning.  It lasted until 5am and it was violent and scary. I won't go into details.  I'm still not feeling 100%.  I missed a day of work.  I called Monday to let them know in case it happened to anyone else.  What if I was pregnant?  I left my name and number with someone so the manger could call me back.  They never did.  It's now Wednesday.  I tried calling back at 5pm and 5:30pm on Monday and it goes straight to a message, not even voicemail. There is no email on their website.

I know these things happen but here is why I'm upset.  No one called me back. If the person who answered the phone didn't relay the message, that is a problem.  If someone had called me back, I never would have written this review.  Cross contamination is a very serious thing especially for a restaurant who has an A rating.  Something went wrong. Someone didn't wash their hands.  The food wasn't handled properly.  I was the unlucky one. The scariest part is the food was delicious but I will never go back.

I've been wanting to go to this restaurant for a while and was very disappointed when I arrived. The service was terrible. The waiter was rude and we received no customer service, never asked if we needed anything, no follow up on drinks, rude from beginning to end. I recommend the drinks, the frozen hibiscus margarita was great, food was good but service I give a 1.

*disclaimer: this place is a little pricey - don't let the laid back atmosphere fool you* Bar Bruno was great. Quality and cozy neighborhood spot where the service is warm, the food and drinks are excellent, and the atmosphere is chill. We heard about this place from friends and wanted to check it out. My lime margarita was great. We got carnitas tacos and shrimp tacos. The carnitas tacos were some of the best ever - the shrimp tacos were good, but the shrimp left something to be desired. Kind of wish I ordered the fish tacos. Plantains were good! They had a little kick! Next time we want too order apps and check out the drink specials. This is truly the first good Mexican food we've had in Carroll Gardens!!

The lady and I ventured to Bruno for a late afternoon, New Year's Eve lunch since a handful of Carroll Gardens spots were closed for the holiday.

I'm SO glad we went here because the Pollo Loco Torta was first class! They also have an updated menu - so the photos shown here include even MORE options.

I'll start off by saying the restaurant was moderately busy with lunch patrons (it was roughly 1-1:30pm when we arrived) and there was only ONE waiter tending to about 20 (TWENTY) people. Despite the chaos, Leo was beyond courteous, attentive and non-stop checking on tables (as well as bar patrons) to ensure they weren't being ignored. Management - give this guy a nice bonus!!!

We started things with the kale dip, which was akin to a spinach artichoke dip with tostito chips. This was an excellent start and we paired it with a pitcher of white sangria. WOW, was it strong, but boy was it tasty! We didn't leave our table without making sure to down every last drop (it was infused with pineapple, as well as pineapple char that the kitchen uses for its tacos, which added a subtle sweetness + smokiness to each glass). Highly recommend, but if you're solo or not in the mood to share the same drink as your company, then peruse the michelada options - they have enough variety to satisfy any taste.

My girlfriend went with the steak tacos, and I ordered the Pollo Loco sandwich (tortas). My lunch came with french fries, but I was entirely too focused on the main attraction: crispy breaded chicken breasts stacked on top of one another with aioli sauce, onion, avocado and some other salsas sandwiched between two perfectly toasted slices of bread (hero roll). No cholula or valentina salsa picante necessary.

I knew I wasn't going to be able to box this up to go (it was NYE after all), so I manned up and challenged myself to push through to the very end. The food coma was waiting in the wings...

I don't regret it and left beyond satisfied. Major props to Leo, as well as the kitchen staff who took care of people on a BUSY holiday. They kept business going without a hitch and people were smart to be patient, because the food was well worth every penny.

Tip your wait staff in places like this. They deserve it.

I'll be back for sure (maybe to watch some rugby or soccer, which the bar seems partial to based on the decor).

Four point FIVE stars.

Why did you remodel?

Why do you allow the old neighborhood locals to sit at the bar after a few too many, ruining any sense of ambience?

Why do you serve mayonnaise and ketchup from plastic to-go packets?
It's totally gross.

I used to go weekly for a burger, taco or quick beer with friends, and haven't been back in a year.

Go back, go back, go back!  New owners?

AMAZING customer service, food, and drinks!! I ordered their pineapple frozen margarita, and habaneros salsa wings! They are definitely not stingy with their alcohol,  are extremely accommodating, and give off wonderful vibes. The drinks are a perfect combination/ratio of sweet/tart/alcohol. An amazing worker Sabrina helped explain the drinks, spiciness levels of the wings, and was extremely patient. For sure will be back soon!

I'm giving this place the benefit of the doubt with this review. Ordered the shrimp tacos and verde salsa. For starters, it's stupid to charge $1 for a little thing of sauce. Most places give it for free. The tacos were reasonably priced however. While the overall flavor of the tacos was quite nice, they were incredibly wet. They just weren't very pleasant to eat. I think that's partly because whoever delivered them did not care at all as most of the contents of the tacos were falling out. I'm assuming if I ate at the restaurant that would not have been a problem. Would like to try again!

We went here to wait for our table to be ready at Lucali and it was really a good place to have a snack and drinks.  The guacamole and chips was fresh made and had a ton of flavour.  The drinks were well made and the service was great as well.  Everything was well priced and neat, clean and I'll be back hopefully for a full meal and not just for a pitstop.

Comfortable and relaxed neighborhood bar with a small food menu.  Recommend it for drinks with friends - food is nothing special, $ 15.00 for 3 tacos on the smaller side.  Bar snacks at best.
Service is easy going and friendly -
would be back for drinks and fries or guacamole, not for dinner.

Talk about an EXPERIENCE!!!! Amazing food, atmosphere and not to mention the service! Our waiter Jonathan  was like professor x a mind reader he had our drinks filled up before asking and hooked it up with the appetizers. Constantly came over to check to see that we were having a good time and if we need anything. Our drinks were on point! The bartenders Eduardo and Joel has the perfect mixture for my passion fruit margarita and made excellent recommendations for the appetizers! Now the enteres I got the "El Torro" that steak was cooked to perfection I thought I was in heaven man I'm about to order another one as I'm writing this. If you don't stop here while your in town or live here your missing out!

Stopped by for drinks and apps at the bar. Contrary to other reviews, we thought the bartender was very friendly and attentive! She was so cheerful, she made me relax a little, even though I was exhausted.

Ordered the michelada (bloody beer) and a $5 Modelo bottle as backup in case we didn't like it. Never had a michelada before, but I love Bloody Marys, so I was hopeful. My boyfriend tried it and was instantly grossed out, but I liked it at first. After a while, the tomato juice tasted too watery and it was a little off putting, but that was my personal preference. I know these are a fan favorite and Bruno certainly made a nice drink, it just wasn't for me.

We were really hungry and I was sad there were only a few appetizer options. Ended up ordering the guacamole. It was unique, with pepitas and cotija sprinkled on top, but I thought the main dip was way too heavy on tomato and onion, the avocado wasn't very prominent. Also, at $11, I expected a larger portion or at least some salsa as well.

Expensive - Chicken burrito with avo $20.

Mediocre - food was not great.

Slow service - eventually stood up to get the check.

Great spot for dinner and or drinks! All of the servers were so friendly and attentive. We were able to sit outside on the evening we went, which I highly recommend! The margaritas were awesome, we would go back for those alone, but the food held its own as well! Everything was very fresh and flavorful. Loved it! Will definitely return

Great place to get a quick drink. We had a frozen margarita for five dollars. We also got a flight of mezcal. Get the three tequilas limes and house tomato bloody Mary mix.  Great atmosphere, very friendly bartenders. Even though the bar was full and packed and the bartender is busy she took her time to explain the menu and the drinks.

Plus yelp check in gets you a $5 margarita!!

Such a neat little spot. Friends and I went to Bar Bruno around 5pm on a Friday. The interior is a bit reminiscent of a diner with retro-Mexican flare. They had great beer deals, $5 cans of Modelo and Tecate. A huge plus for this place is they bring out chips and salsa to every table. Places with free chips really have a special place in my heart.

We split the kale and poblano dip and also the guacamole. Both were incredible. The flavor of the kale dip was very, very good. One of the better appetizers I've had in a long time.

This place has great drinks, food, and vibes. Highly recommend.

Thank you for serving proper Mexican sugar cane coke and pure guacamole in the Carrol Gardens area.

That creamy roasted corn is something really special, a simple concoction that needs much much more public attention. The bar top stone cold, a quite inviting feature when coming in from the summer heat. Plus street tacos and spicy rimmed mezcal cocktails that will put a smile on even the worst curmudgeons face.

My first time visiting here was awesome! We stopped in for a few drinks a small bites to eat. The cucumber margarita was refreshing and had good cucumber flavor. The jalapeño margarita had a kick to it and was also very good! I would get both again. They have classic margaritas, pineapple margaritas, and other cocktails. The margaritas are $12, but worth it because they are strong and made well! We ordered their chips and guacamole. The guacamole was amazing! It had pumpkin seeds in it which is unusual, but was really tasty! They give you a generous amount of guacamole. Overall, loved this place and will definitely be back!

Placed a pick-up order from Delivery.com, waited 30 minutes, went to pick up and they said they hadn't received the order because they weren't logged into Delivery.com so I had to wait. The bartender was very nice about it and offered me a free drink while I waited, but the music was so loud and atrocious I would have preferred to wait outside until my order was ready. Seriously it sounded like a club in this place on a Sunday night. Not sure how anyone could hear each other or think straight. Definitely won't be dining in anytime soon.

I will say that when I got home I noticed they had thrown in a free chips and salsa AND dessert, so that definitely made up for the wait. I'd just recommend turning the music down to a reasonable volume!

This was a great find in this Brooklyn neighborhood!

My five friends and I were quoted a pretty long wait over at Lucali just down the road, so I quickly yelped something for some appetizers and drinks while we waited.

They were able to seat us right away and we got straight to ordering. We got a pitcher of sangria, two orders of chips and guacamole, an order of chicharrones, two tortilla soups, and an order of plantains.

Wow. My friends and I were all very quiet while eating because we were impressed at how good and fresh the food was. The guacamole was chunky and so tasty. The chicharrones came straight out of the frier and were so light and airy! You couldn't eat just one, they're dangerous. The plantains were cooked well and had a white sauce over them. I don't know what it was but it was great haha My two friends loved their tortilla soup.

The sangria pitcher provided just the right amount of portions for our group of 6. It was not too sweet and so refreshing!

Everything was reasonably priced and proved to be great for appetizers! Stumbled upon it by accident but would totally come back again.
