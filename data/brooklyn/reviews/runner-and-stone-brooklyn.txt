Delicious bread! We tried the buckwheat baguette last night and ate the whole thing in one sitting! Nutty and delicious. We highly recommend. The croissants are also amazing. Almost like Paris. They are open during this pandemic - support local business and get amazing bread!

What an adorable little spot! Not even sure where to begin, the food the wait staff, the ambiance and the experience was all 5 star quality. Julio, the manager gives great service and will leave you feeling full and even a little tipsy!

The food menu  is well rounded and adaptable to food allergies. The lumache is so amazing- a vegan option that would be unrecognizable to someone who eats dairy. The pastas are all made in house which makes them so fresh.

Dessert- get the cake with the chocolate gnash (spelling?) you will for sure want to drink it up with a straw.

Overall a great dining experience and would recommend to anyone!!!

I trekked 25 minutes by foot specifically to try Runner & Stone's almond croissant, after reading the myriad of glowing reviews about this particular item. Forking over $4 for the somewhat smaller-than-expected pastry, I had high expectations. I would say that it met, but did not exceed, my expectations. The almond croissant was very flaky, but overall I found it to be overbaked and somewhat dense. The almond paste, however, in the middle is a thing of beauty. I appreciated that it was rich and abundant, but not too sweet or cloying. I probably wouldn't seek it out again since I found the outer layer too crusty, but I enjoyed it for what it was worth.

Really disappointed by the size to price ratio of their pre-made sandwiches today. I purchased an egg salad sandwich that measured roughly 3"x3, which cost $12 but probably had 1 tablespoon's worth of egg salad in each half, and was mostly pickled red onion. I'm not in the business of complaining, but I work in the industry myself and have standards and expectations. I've enjoyed your sandwiches in the past and felt their were worth the cost, but definitely not today. Either lower the price of the egg sandwich, or actually make it worth $12.

I came here for brunch during my lunch hour. The service here was really fast:  getting seated, ordering, and my food coming out happened in a 15-20 minute window.

I ordered the french toast with a side of bacon. The french toast had an amazing marmalade on top of it. That marmalade with the very savory syrup was a perfect blend. I was tempted to order another french toast to go. The bacon was good and had a nice crunch to it. I expected to get a bigger portion of bacon for the price.

The restaurant seems small but I didn't venture past the bar seating. All of the pastries displayed had a nice presentation and I will definitely be back to try them out or maybe just go for french toast.

We had a private event, around 12 people for a baby shower there for a Saturday Brunch.  We were able to utilize a private room area downstairs that was the perfect size (can fit a few more) for our crowd.  Julio was very easy to work with in organizing the event.  The staff, including Emily, was very helpful and accommodating the day of the event.  All of their food was delicious, the fried chicken being a crowd favorite!
Pricing is reasonable, especially considering what many places in NYC ask for / require in spending.  Definitely recommend this restaurant, especially for an event!

The Gowanus neighborhood in Brooklyn has many resident's, and no real bakery. Runner and Stone is the only place in the nabe where one can purchase a loaf of bread, and pastries. If you own a vehicle make a trip elsewhere. To begin, staff and patrons are not adhering to social distancing rules, and nobody is wearing a mask. Bread is tough and tasteless, and pastries aren't any better. Their prices are higher than average for Brooklyn, but there appears to be no shortage of money in this neighborhood. 3rd Avenue monopoly.

I dislike posting negative review's, but i feel obligated to post one of Runner & Stone. I dined there recently along with a friend, and was disappointed, to say the least. Runner & Stone is a tiny restaurant located in the Gowanus section of Brooklyn. I went in with high expectation's, after hearing good thing's from a dear friend. My dinner was less than spectacular. I started with a glass of Chianti, A tiny glass of insipid wine for $15. My guest ordered a Martini. Three sip's and the glass was empty, cost $19. We ordered Duck Prosciutto as our app, it was tough and tasteless .Entree's weren't any better. Squid ink Bucatini was overcooked, contained only a tiny bit of Crab and Lobster, and the dish was drowning in Butter. My Orecchiete was overcooked, and full  of Pork fat.  When I complained to the manager, Julio, he shrugged his shoulder's and replied "I can't please everybody". I guess I won't be returning.

Stopped by for pastries because I had tried the anise fig bread a while back and loved it. I've seen the bad reviews in regards to service and thought, how bad could it be for ordering at the counter? While it wasn't terrible, the worker was obviously dreaming of the end of her shift because me and my sister requested the buckwheat bread TWICE and when we got home we realized that we were charged for it and there was no sign of the bread. Not to mention that we were told they were out of the anise bread and I pointed to a loaf in front of the worker and she was surprised and acknowledged that it was indeed anise.

I've been overcharged at other bakeries before and tire of it when there's no excuse of the place being packed or there being a long and complicated order. None of that here. Moral is either to shop elsewhere or CHECK YOUR BAG BEFORE leaving the place.

Excellent! I Roth going to just for a loaf of bread or a pastry. The ham and cheese croissant is delicious, and they have a stand at the farmer's market on sundays. They're sit down food is also delicious. Great for brunch, afternoon hangs, or a date night dinner.

I'm just going to go out on a limb and say this place is probably best for breakfast and lunch, but not for dinner. Our Saturday night meal was pretty tasty and the service was very good. But not so memorable that I can recall what exactly we ate (it was pasta for me). It just didn't knock my socks off. And the portions - particularly for the appetizers - were very small. Surprisingly we didn't care for dessert either - it was some type of rye pudding. Another dessert had booze in it and the one non-drinker at our table seemed to get it all in one bite. That said, I will gladly say that Runner and Stone has delicious baked goods and I love their chocolate croissant. And if you can get their Christmas stollen during the holidays, it is out of this world. I just don't think I'll be back for dinner.

My second time here and both times had such a bad experience with the services. People at the counter are so rude that we eventually decided to leave everything and run out.
We used to buy their pretzels and bread at the park slope farmers market for years and decided to come to the bakery to try it out. The first time we came in, the staff was quite rude, but people have bad days so we decided to give it another chance today. Today was even worse so this will be our last time here. I'm not coming back again.

TLDR: Nice relaxed bi-level space with great food and even better pastries/breads. I definitely look forward to returning! Overall rating: A+

I made an easy reservation through Yelp. My friend and I were seated right away on a Monday night though arriving 10 minutes early. Its a casual, friendly place. I was pleasantly surprised by the comfortable spacing between tables, low noise level, and good amount of light. The service was wonderful! It was prompt but they didn't make you feel rushed! Clean bathrooms. Now into the good stuff, the food!

-Complimentary amuse bouche: Small square of flaky bread like a extra crunchy croissant with olive pieces. A

-Complimentary bread assortment: Buckwheat Baguette, Bolzano Miche, and a third unknown bread with house-made butter. I've never had such flavorful bread and that homemade butter just put it over the top! A+

-Duck Pastrami appetizer with beer mustard, pickled onions, rye bread: My favorite appetizer of the night! Fatty and juicy, paired well with the accompaniments! Smaller portion though. Only 5 pieces total I believe. A+

-House cured chorizo with pink flavored goat cheese, pickled ramps, and served with bread: This was a special of the day. While decent, not as good as the pastrami. Not spicy, kind of oily for me. Even smaller portion than the duck but more expensive too. I'd pass on this. B+

-Carrot Lumache pasta with rabbit ragu, spring peas, rosemary: I got the small/appetizer size. So good! Lonely housemade pasta. It was a really flavorful and light spring dish! I wish I got this as the bigger entree portion! A++

-Semolina Gnocchi with caramelized onion, mushrooms, red cabbage, pistachio pecorino: I got the small/appetizer size of this as well. I wasn't really a fan of this dish. It was very heavy for a vegetarian dish! The homemade gnocchi was too al dente. Worst of all it was lacking in the flavor department. I didn't really taste the caramelized onion or pistachio. Pass! C

-Squid Ink Bucatini with lobster, crab, pepperocino, herbs, chilies: My friend got this as the entree size. The pasta is in the shape of long straws. It was interesting since I never tried squid ink pastas before. It's very fishy though. Probably due to it being topped with seafood. Also garnished with crunchy breadcrumbs. So if you don't enjoy the taste of the ocean then skip this. Since I'm not a fan of fishy things, I'd hard pass on this! C-

-Coffee Panna Cotta with whipped cream and cacao nibs: It was served with chocolate shortbread on the side. This was excellent! Lots of delicious coffee flavor and not too sweet. I appreciated the contrasting textures between the soft, custardy panna cotta vs the crunchy cacao nibs and shortbread. A

-Croissant, $2.50: I asked our server to set aside a croissant for me since I heard such great things about them! It didn't disappoint even after 7pm! A+

Pro Tip: Half price bottle of any wines during Monday and Tuesday dinner! We got the Terre Di Marca Prosecco. Normally $42, but we got it for $21. Really great deal when a glass of the same prosecco is $11 each!

Everything came out to about $130 after tax (not including tip yet). Not bad for 2 appetizers, the equivalent of 2 entrees, 1 dessert, 1 pastry, and 1 bottle of wine. Only thing I didn't love was the industrial/empty streets of this neighborhood (Gowanus). I still felt comfortable walking around though. This would be a special occasion place for me. Looking forward to my next visit. Hopefully, when their menu rotates with the season!

Hands down, best almond chocolate croissant that I've had in New York City and the only croissant that stands up to the ones at b. Patisserie in San Francisco. The almond filling is thick, wonderfully textural, and not too sweet. The filling also subtly tastes like egg pudding, which I love.

Even their plain croissant is sooo flaky and melts in your mouth as you chew. They also have a unique einkorn croissant, which is like a whole wheat croissant that has a more wholesome, grainy taste. It would be perfect to make an egg sandwich with or to enjoy with some jam.

Besides being a bakery that has croissants you can't get anywhere else, Runner & Stone is a full restaurant plus bar. They manage to maintain a very relaxed and welcoming vibe in their chic, modern space.

For dinner, their roasted beet salad had a unique cumin dressing that was warming and satisfying. It was a nice way to start the meal and I'd order it again. I usually don't like gnocchi because I find it can get mushy very easily, but theirs had a nice chew to it. Plus it was generously topped with... pistachio pecorino. So good.

The cherry on top was the excellent, down-to-earth service. It really makes it feel like a go-to, neighborhood spot. Can't wait to go back again!

Delightful lunch with my son. It's a quiet little spot. The lunch menu is small but the selections are varied and will satisfy any palate. They have home made potato chips that are yummy.  Looks like they have a nice wine selection although I don't know if they have a happy hour.

I LOVED IT HERE.
Super chill vibe that was filled with kindness.
Loved the decor.
Came around 11am on a Sunday. Plenty of seats available. Our server/host was perfection. She was so calm and smooth. It just made you feel good and that you were in the right place. (Hey. I know. It was Brunch. Like relax, Molly. It isn't that serious. But man, I realllllly liked the vibe.)

I will be back to experience the dinner menu.

Oh, I must also mention the selection of treats from the the bakery displayed in the front. We grabbed a few before we left.
The guy managing that section was super kind and funny. The treats were out of this world. Cheers to this team!

Wow, I adore this place. I had the great fortune to come here with some professors who have made this their spot for special dinners and so we got treated like royalty. But I have no doubt Runner & Stone is consistently the bomb dot com when it comes to service.

First off, the liquor and wine selection here is impeccable - local gin, orange sparkling wine, a whiskey sour that perfectly hit the spot, etc. Then, the unbelievable food. We opened with these crunchy olive baklava type bites and then some of the most savory and flavorful bread I've ever had. We had some of their specials (the potato and ham croquettes were unbelievable), as well as some of their First dishes (the beet salad was very, very good). Then the entrées: oh my GOSH that fried chicken is so good, on a bed of tart slaw. And finally, the mindblowing desserts: I had the elderflower creme brûlée with black currant jam and buckwheat shortbread and my word, did they do that creme brûlée justice with the perfect caramelized layer and the sweet sweet jam underneath. The staff was helpful and offered personalized suggestions to guide our decision-making.

They sent us on our way with loaves of bread (so psyched to try this stout cheddar bread) and bellies full of warmth and good food. Needless to say, if you want a truly satisfying dining experience, which features all of the little things I mentioned, Runner & Stone is the place for it.

Went for dinner .
Atmosphere 5 stars
Food 4 stars
Service 5 stars

Husband loved the fish ( I felt it was slightly underdone )
Kids loved loved loved the brown butter gnocchi
I enjoyed the fried chicken ( didnt think it was the best I had tasted but still a good rendition of fried chicken with crispy skin, moist meat. It just fell short on the seasoning department. Wasn't the best seasoning mix I'd tasted.
They had yummy bread  and butter- they better ! They are also a bakery / restaurant with a stellar cast of freshly baked pretzels, croissants, bread etc
I plan to return one morning to gorge myself silly on their baked goods.

I keep going back and I continue to be impressed! This time we took my brother, mother and father in law and they all agreed. The spaghetti with duck ragu was delicious, the fried chicken was better than blue ribbon and the chicken liver pate was excellent. Plus, the service is amazing - Julio has been legendary every time we've visited.

I went here with my wife on a Friday night. We had reservations for 8pm and we were sat straight away next to the front windows. The service was prompt and friendly, we had the crostini app with mushrooms, ricotta and truffle oil. It was delicious. We ordered pasta as our mains having heard of how good the bread and homemade pasta was. We shared the squid ink pasta and the ragu. I'm happy to say it was some of the best pasta I've had in NYC, all boroughs included. We will be back many, many times!

Had a good time here with family.

Tried the
duck pastrami-best duck I've had!
baby iceberg salad-pretty good
grilled porkchop-very nice flavor and quite tender

One of our party had the fish of the day which was a black bass that she really enjoyed as well.

The service was really good and prompt.  Only thing was, at the end of the night I asked for a whiskey listing and indicated I might want scotch but ordered a bourbon instead and the waitress made a huge deal about how that's not scotch...like yea, i know...chill.

Overall, good meal but really expensive and I wasn't that into the vibe of the place.  (this is personal not a "fact" of the place)  I just didn't feel like it was worth the money to me.  Probably won't be back but would definitely recommend it to others.

What a lovely place. Went with a group for dinner and couldn't have been more welcomed by the owner. The Squid Ink Bucatini with Lobster was worth wanting as an appetizer, entree and the dessert. I didn't just want more... I needed more! The ice cream selection was yummy with the Sour Cream being my favorite. Next time I'm in Brooklyn, I'm definitely coming back!

For a place that's a bakery first and a restaurant second...this is a damn fine restaurant.

I'm not sure if they are simply the nicest folks around or if the waitress was desperately in love with me,* but they started us off with fantastic mini-croissants, and when we were leaving they sent the two couples at our table our way with a loaf of excellent bread each (again, bakery first).

In between, we indulged in fried chicken, strip steaks, amazing pastas, chicken liver pate, and much more. I'm not going to complain about any of it. The wine list, while short and sweet, is surprisingly on point as well. We aren't winos...wait, we are winos. We aren't wine SNOBS, but we definitely found their curated selections to be delicious.

Personally, I've cooked and I've baked, and baking is more difficult. It's not surprising that the talented bakers here can also cook delicious things. See you again soon.

*I lied. It's definitely the former.

Step 1: Cut a hole in a box.
Step 2. Order some palmiers.

I forgot what I was talking about, but seriously, the palmiers (you may know them as elephant ears) are fantastic. And really, all the baked goods from breads to pastries are outstanding. Get some of them.

I've been to Runner & Stone on several occasions, and from what I can tell, they are serving quality food in a cozy little atmosphere. It's an excellent place to hold a business meeting over a few shared snacks, or to have a nice sit-down lunch. If you're there for the former, palmiers are a must (I can't stress this enough because I really do enjoy butter), and for the latter, I really like the braised chicken sandwich.

If I had any criticisms, they are:

1. It's almost impossible to read the specials at the wrong time of day, thanks to a combination of handwriting and them being written on a mirror reflecting blinding light into your eyes. (And I really wanted to know about that corned beef sandwich, because it was good.)

2. The service is a bit awkward. Not because of the staff, they are all complete sweethearts. Rather, because it's very unclear how you're supposed to proceed when you want food and/or beverages because there is an odd combination of table service/counter service. So let me help you:

Even if you're the only one in the space, you have to go up to the counter (which could be five feet away) to order, and to pay when you're done. If you want water though, there's a little station where you can serve yourself. Your food will be brought to you, but silverware is up at the station as well, unless you want spoons...then I think you have to ask.

I feel the need to answer these questions because I watched every customer ask them; perhaps a sign (or a system change) is in order. I haven't been for dinner yet, so I think you're on your own there.

I came here for dinner on a Monday night.  The place is larger than you would expect from looking at the outside.  We ordered the duck pastrami and the large orecchiette with pork sausage and broccoli raven.  The bread basket was really good since they bake their own bread so the bread is fresh.  The duck pastrami was interesting - making your own pastrami sandwich with duck breast instead of pastrami.  The duck was not warm though.  I wish it wasn't so cold.  The orecchiette was tasty and the sausage was juicy.  I would come back to try their brunch.

What are you doing right now? Nothing you say? I think you should run over to runner and stone! (Haha cheesy I know, but true)

I love runner and stone. It is the cutest little place for great coffee/tea as well as a good meal. The staff are all very nice and welcoming and the atmosphere is very Sunday afternoon everyday of the week.

My absolute fave thing to have here is the chamomile tea and the ham and cheese croissant. It is the best ham and cheese I've had. If you are going in hopes to try the ham and cheese croissant it's best to go as early as possible because they do sell out fast. I've taken many walks over to find they were sold out. They put the perfect amount of ham and cheese inside and the outside is topped with seeds and flavor almost the same tastes you would get on top of an everything bagel but more subtle.

The soft pretzels here are also very good they are nice and soft.

If you are ever looking for a good breakfast or brunch spot this is the perfect place to go.

This was my first visit to Runner & Stone. It was a Sunday at 12:15pm.  After a hearty welcome by the staff, I took a seat at the empty counter although all tables were occupied and there was a wait in the small confines. Strategically placed mirrors make it appear as a larger space than it really is. I ordered the Chef's Omelette for my brunch item which came with potatoes. I enjoyed my meal while listening to music that was drowned out by patron chatter. For $17, the meal was limited in quantity plus I've tasted much better. As a runner, I was hoping for more from those with Runner in the name.

Been here twice after work meetings.  I had the duck pastrami salad (delicious) and a latte (fantastic).  The server, who I have seen twice, was extremely personable and attentive.  While this experience was nice and all, I need to mention the best part: the baked goods.  I bought a hot cross bun to take on the road and goddamn it was good!  It was the best one I have ever had.  I plan on going back just to try more from the bakery.

First I will say that the food was very good and our waiter, Jeremy, was top-notch. That said, we won't be going back due to our interaction with the Host, Julio, which left us with a bad taste in our mouths (pun intended). With so many other restaurants to choose from, I will go to one that acts like it wants me as a customer. Here is what happened:

Our party of 4 arrived for our reservation and Julio said he had a table for us downstairs.

We asked to be seated upstairs at an open 4-top.  He told us no because he was keeping it for a  party of 6.

Julio led us to the charmless basement that at one point filled with not so pleasant cooking aromas from the kitchen below.

The table he gave us was so close to another table on one side that we couldn't get into our seats.

We asked to push it back as there was 5-6 ft of empty space on the other side. The request was not greeted with enthusiasm and he said couldn't push it too close to a door marked "employees only".  He moved it a fraction.  We had to move it more ourselves so we could sit down and be comfortable.  During the evening one employee did use that door a few times -- he carefully opened and closed and seemed quite fine doing so.

All of this was annoying, but what pushed us over the edge was that we could see the table we asked for and it stayed empty for the first hour of our meal, and then was filled with a party of 4.

We got the message.  We won't be back, but we do thank Jeremy for his sense of humor and his excellent food recommendations.

I came here on a whim just to kill time while waiting to meet up with a friend. I've read a lot about their pastries so I grabbed a table and ordered their almond croissant and a cup of cappuccino. The almond croissant was probably one of the best almond croissants I've had in a very long time! It was really crunchy with lots of almond flavor in the filling. This is what almond croissants should be...both flaky and crunchy at the same time. Their cappuccino was also spot on. While most people around me were ordering brunch meals, I was pretty content with just my croissant and coffee. The people here were really nice and didn't rush me especially since I had a table all to myself. I would definitely come back again and try either their brunch or dinner.

We were a party of 6, went for dinner on a Thursday at 7, made reservations in advance. They had our table ready when we walked in, and we were seated immediately. (score 1 for Runner & Stone for knowing both how to take the reservation AND honor the reservation!) Service was great ... friendly and attentive. I ordered a glass of wine, and our server brought the bottle and gave me a taste before pouring. Nice.

We'd heard about the bread. And yeah, the bread is fantastic, and the butter is cultured in-house!

From there, we shared a few apps - all were great -  and moved onto the entrees. Actually, to cut to the chase, all the food from apps to dessert was prepared well and quite delicious. We had a wonderful tiome here and highly recommend.

They gave us some chocolate croissants to take home for next-day breakfast as we were leaving. OMG best I've ever had! We shall return!

Amazing service, the food was perfect. We even got an amuse bouche that wasn't part of our order and went to a birthday after that we didn't even need to get drinks at because we were so stuffed and pleasantly satisfied by our drinks at this restaurant. Perfect for an anniversary dinner, date night, or just a good spot where you can hear each other for dinner with friends!

Super friendly staff as well
