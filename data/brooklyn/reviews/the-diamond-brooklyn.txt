A perfect place to day drink in the backyard. Shuffle board too. They have a lovely beer and wine list but didn't serve liquor.

Very cool spot with plenty of personality and drafts. Cocktails are good, too. The outside patio is dope, including the stabbed Pinocchio a few feet underground (no further explanation available). I was just here for a birthday celebration and had a great time. Shuffleboard available for those who get bored easily. It's an odyssey away from my apartment, but when I find myself in Greenpoint again I may totally go back.

The Diamond (in the rough) is another great douchy bar in Greenpoint with a decent sized patio--5 benches--and a shuffleboard. I stopped by for some saison on tap. They feature two good saison this time; ICONYC Hollapeño and Catskill's Oak-Aged Saison. The latter one is pretty dank which I recommend.

Oh, a cheese plate came in a small portion when I ordered it large. Anyway, the bartender is friendly.

Solid bar in greenpoint. Has outside seating too if the weather is nice. Small tap list but all very good beers. They have some cocktails/wine on the menu and a few bits of nosh if you get hungry. My friend got the spanakopita and liked it.

One shuffleboard court and a decent amount of seating inside but its a small place. Prices were NYC, no deal here. Good vibes and would definitely return.

This is officially my favorite bar in the city.  Not a new bar to this area in greenpoint, by any stretch, but a new bar find for me, and I am glad I found it.

They have some awesome beer and wine here.  Each of the options, tasty and delicious.

The outdoor space is where its at.  I think this is a new thing, and Im not sure if its every night, but they have two lovely ladies slinging grill-made tacos in the back.  They are amazing.  Each of them.  That night, the pork (carnitas) were the clear winner but they were all very good.

This guy. Does he care about business? Clearly it's not his. He said he didn't want to accept my global entry bc he didn't think it was real (I'm 30- the ID is real, it's a Sunday afternoon). Then we were googling global entry to show him that it was legitimate. And he said he didn't FEEL LIKE IT. This was after we asked about the drinks on draft and he told us to go over and read the menu. We couldn't see the menu but we could see there were 6 beers and asked if he wouldn't mind just telling us which was an IPA. Then he said nevermind to our IDs and changed his mind from the legitimacy of IDs to serving. Sucks.

Comment from David P. of The Diamond

Business Owner

3/18/2019Hi Victoria, my name is Dave and I am the owner of the bar.  We were happy when your group came in and were looking forward to getting you guys on the slot car table.  You may remember me on the table getting that started with one of your friends.

In regards to poor service, I never like to hear this and am sorry that you had a bad experience here.  We often tell customers to look at the board when they ask about the beers because its generally an easier starting off point for the customer and the bartender.  We are generally, of course, happy to answer any questions about the products.  But, taking pictures of someone and threatening to report them on yelp because they are not comfortable accepting your ID is not likely to get you the best service.  This should not be overlooked to anyone reading this review.

In regards to the ID, when our bartenders see someone that they think could potentially be under age, they must see a US passport, drivers license, or military ID.  That instruction is a non-negotiable directive that comes from me.  They have no say in the matter.  Global entry ID's are not something we have been shown before and therefore we would have to take time on our own to research it and add it to our list of acceptable ID's or not.  Its not something that we are going to change policy on in 5 seconds because a customer shows us something on google when our entire license and business is at stake.  It doesn't matter what time of day it is or what day of the week.

This is a cute place that's a little off the beaten path.  They have a nice enough beer selection.  There is definitely a "locals" type of vibe going on here, so I felt like a bit of an interloper as I tried to enjoy my draft.

The shuffleboard is kind of neat to watch and the decor is nice.  Service was a bit slow for a place that only had about 10 people total in it, but again, I think that's because I'm not a regular.

If you're in the neighborhood, you wouldn't be disappointed if you stopped by.

Recommended by those In the know, this did not disappoint.  Super-cool ambience, fairly amazing cocktail concoctions, friendly service.  Nerd note:  the music they were playing was incredible.   Almost all female-fronted new wave/post-punk like Girls at Our Best, Raincoats, etc.  If I lived here, I'd live here.

The Diamond bar is the best bar in New York City. I've been a patron for over 10 years. They have thoughtfully curated beer options. The options change regularly but are always delicious. They have booze now, too. The staff is knowledgeable, funny, and simply the best around. The backyard is lovely. Only good things here. Stop by.

Fantastic bar, just a little unfortunate it's a far from the train. I'd say The Diamond is a harmonious marriage of a classy beer connoisseurs bar and a low key dive bar. The place is very clean, friendly, and fairly spacious. Don't expect Bud light here, they have a very unique beer list (tap and bottles). Their beer list is separated on three pages, Lightweight, Middleweight, and Heavyweight beers (categorized by abv%), prices range from a $4 Otter Creek copper ale to beers hovering around $20, most options are $6-8. Their food is limited to a few Tuck Shop "pies" , a cheese or pickle/olive plate, and another option or two. Their backyard patio is a dual level beauty. The space is great and has a fun enclosed ski lift car, not for the claustrophobic.

Lastly, one of The Diamonds greatest features besides it's back yard is it's full sized (and free) table shuffle board. Any bar that dedicates that kind of real estate to a game or games, gets an A in my book. If it wasn't for the beer prices and location I would have given them a 5 star rating.

I really need to spend more time in Greenpoint...

After the conclusion of an epic House of Vans concert featuring Future Islands (you really need to check these guys out) just down the street, myself and a group of pals decided to hit the nabe for a quick nightcap before retiring to bed. 2,000 concertgoers seemed to think they were all going to get into Northern Territory right across the street, so we pulled a fast one and headed north to The Diamond. It was one of the wiser decisions I've made recently.

It's a pretty simple bar with a nice list of beers, wines, and plenty of spirits to choose from. You can choose to sip these within the cozy confines of the bar or take your libations to the back patio for a relaxing hang on a handful of picnic tables or even an old gondola. And if you're a shuffleboard player, they take it pretty seriously here. If you've never played, you'll get a full tutorial by way of an infograph along the south wall. Again, they take it pretty seriously.

If you haven't been, you'll really dig it. Get in there ASAP!

We stop by this bar thinking they offer flight of beers but when we got there we will told they dont do flights. Nevertheless we stayed for a drink. We were there on a Wednesday night with only 3 other groups of people. Since it was a quite night we did not have to fight anyone for the shuffle board. The shuffle board was a good touch and the bartender is nice. It's a cute spot but there's a lot of other better spots around you can go to.

Definitely a nice place for locals, but not really anyone else. It's right down the block from House of Vans, but everyone kinda defaults to the rooftop across the street. They have beer and wine, and if you like anything else you're SOL. So, I was SOL and for that reason, and for the fact that I felt completely out of place (I'm actually from NYC and no, I didn't just go to college here) I don't think I'll be back.

We found this gem thanks to Brokelyn's Beer Book (30 coupons for beers in North Brooklyn for only $30). We can't wait to return to The Diamond! This is our new fave spot in Greenpoint. We came here at 10pm on a Thursday and quickly become fans. Friendly bartender (Will), unique beer selection, kind people at the bar, and a vintage red phone on the wall you can actually use were just a few highlights. Also, the backyard looked awesome.

While waiting in a depression-era soup kitchen line to try the release of Cuvée Noire at the Brooklyn Brewery, I met a sound engineer for a video game developer. We're making conversation and he starts describing a beer-centric bar with shuffleboard tournaments and Southern boiled peanuts that definitely sounds like my bag. What was really grinding my gears was the way he was eye-boning my half French+Cuban friend's chest the whole time. Then I remembered he worked for Rockstar Games, where if your boss catches you watching Seven Years in Thai Butt, she showers you with praise for your research ethic. We had words, he apologized and we made-up en route to the aforementioned brew-lover's lounge...The Diamond.

Beverages should be organized mathematically. Ranked according to alcohol % rather than the archaic Linnaean classification by origin. Mon petit ami used to say, "I don't drink according to percentages, I just want to savor the taste." Good for her, but somehow I got the body of an NHL player but the dainty stomach of a figure skater. I start at double digits and work my way down --

't Gaverhopke Extra: 12% Belgian Quadruple is the best alcohol bang for your buck at $10. It's so yeasty I thought it might give my mouth an infection.

Oktoberfest Drafts: available during fall, these 8% Märzens were tapped directly from barrels plastered with EU protected designation and Reinheitsgebot (German beer purity law) certificates. Best accompanied by $2 local brats served on pretzel rolls with whole grain mustard.

Sinebrychoff Porter: I hate every Finnish dish I've ever tried because they all taste like salty licorice. This 7% dark beer is no different.

I missed the complimentary Lombardi's pizza at the event but thankfully Frenchie and I shared common interests, mainly fatty/pickled/savory foods. Our ranks had swelled so we ordered assorted Charcuterie, Cheese Board, Pickle Plate and --

Brutus the Barber Beefpie: Aussie-style pot pie with chunks of meat, pepper-jack cheese and gravy named after this WWF villain --

d2tq98mqfjyz2l.cloudfron…

They picked the wrong dude to be a drug-free role model. I don't know what's going to explode first, his liver from the roids or his heart from the yayo.

Everything was going just swell. I was buzzing, full and happened to bump into some long lost high school friends, when Sammy Hagar showed up. How dare the Red Rocker show his face around me after the Balance album! I don't bring weapons into bars, so I grabbed the next best thing out of a nearby patron's hand...5 darts.

1. This one's for Red: My Uncensored Life in Rock. I wouldn't burn that book from fear the smoke would smell like shit. My hands were trembling with rage so I missed.

2. This one's for taking 4 minutes 42 seconds of my life with the I Can't Drive 55 music video and pierced his ear.

3. This one's for making Cabo Wabo Tequila so goddamn expensive and took out his right eye.

4. This one's so you'll never sing again and hit him right in the corner of his mouth.

5. This one's for just in case you recover from the last one and left him with one dangling from his Adam's apple.

When my anger subsided, I realized it was only a picture of the man that single-handedly destroyed Van Halen, on a cork board.

The management of the D does not condone displays of violence, so I was forced into time-out in the cable car outside. It was cramped in that little red télécabine but Maybe Partying Will Help by The Minutemen was playing while I thought about what I did wrong.

I like the way the Diamond does business. The staff want to be there, the menu always has something new and something familiar on it and you can just be a kid again. A raging alcoholic kid that likes to watch girl-on-girl arm wrestling --

youtube.com/watch?v=qWD_…

Note to self, don't wager on half-Asians because you think their superior ability to strategize will lead them to victory. Place your bets on the 6' Red Sonja clone. I wonder who won the Women vs. Waifs (men under 145 lbs) challenge...

Stopped in here for about an hour during the Bon appetite grub crawl. The owners and staff were very friendly. I liked the outdoor patio area in the back as well... Perfect for a good weather hangout. The jukebox had unlimited credits when I was there, so I got to jam out to the few hip hop songs they had ... Mostly 70-90's rock.

Definitely stop in again while visiting .

Decent beer selection, ok food and one of the better shuffleboard tables in BK. Unfortunately, the bartender working on 7/30 was one of the most pretentious and snotty people I've ever come across. Complete stereotypical Brooklyn hipster clown and I won't be returning based on that (and some of the other reviews I'm reading now that claim the same thing).

This is a story all about how
My night got flipped by a bartender
Ruder than most
She didn't card my friend
Cause she "looked older"
But wouldn't serve me
Cause I left my id at home
My bf tried to buy drinks for us both
And got denied
Even tho we're both 25
She was rude and unapologetic
She makes her own rules

Go to another bar on the franklin strip
You will enjoy yourself much more
I guarantee it.

Me: "Do you have Stella?"

Bartender: "No, we something exactly like Stella. It's as if we just put a different label on the Stella keg."

The beer I got was absolutely nothing like Stella, in fact, it was wheaty and skunky. Sooo...either the bartender knew nothing about beer. (I hope) Or, he just figured he was so much smarter than the patrons of his bar he could say whatever he thought the patrons wanted to hear and they would be happy.

So as a New Yorker born and bred, and a recent transplant from Manhattan to Greenpoint, looking for a local place, I would never go back. Just another example of how this area of Brooklyn is becoming so "hip" that most places are off limits to the thinking New Yorker population. Real New Yorkers are just not smart enough to drink in Hipsterville. Sad.

I knew I was going to love this place the second I walked in. Mainly because the bartender was wearing a lady gaga tee - but also because the vibes were A positive. They just celebrated their 6 year anniversary... Perhaps going on 60.

Good vibes. Fantastic decor. And I can afford the drinks.

Great prices and amazing atmosphere!

My favorite parts of this place are the patio, beer selection and  atmosphere. It was divey without being dirty and the staff were super friendly. Super chill and a great place to have a drink.

The only downside was that there wasn't any shots available but... that was probably for the best in most cases

Great low-key bar on Franklin, at the end of a string of decent low-key bars.

First thing, GREAT beer selection without being a pretentious craft beer bar. They have a lot of my favorites here: Brooklyn fire and ice, Brooklyn East IPA, Koelsch, Schneider Weisse, and then a lot of beers that I didn't know would soon be my favorite. The beers are also well categorized by ABV percentages.

Also, in the winter time I love their mulled wine. They also have shuffleboard, darts, a nice outdoor area. Overall, great casual atmosphere. Its a little off the beaten path so it's never too crowded to comfortably order at the bar.

Great service, go out of your way to go here.

Here are some observations for The Diamond:

Great draft and bottle/can list, with beers arranged from session to middle weight to strong in ABV.

Beware of the floating Michael Landon head guarding the stairs.

The fire alarms are functioning properly.

The single bathroom needs better ventilation or an industrial strength air freshener.

The gondola can accommodate up to 10 people.

You will most likely not unseat the people at shuffleboard who were already playing when you walked in.

Accepts credit and offers meat pies.

The Diamond is a nice little bar in Greenpoint/Williamsburg with interesting decor. The curved wooden bar table is really nice. The bathroom is covered with cassette tapes from the 80s and 90s (when else really).

The beer selection is not particularly massive, but there will be stuff that most of you have not had (the beers I drank there had less than ten ratings). The bartender was a pretty nice person, and she seemed to be generally familiar with beer and was aware of the reasons why all the beers were chosen to be on the menu. However, she did play nothing but Nirvana for the three hours that we were there (one band wednesdays).

The place was not too crowded on a Wednesday, but it did not feel empty either.

The prices are generally pretty reasonable as well. Beers on tap cost between $6 and $8. The bottled beers were, however, more expensive. Fortunately, they do not serve Bud Light.

The food was good. The savory pies were tasty and filling and the pickle and olive plate was pretty tasty.

Free shuffleboard.

I would certainly go again.

This place is AMAZING. Hands down, I shit you not, amazing.

I'm a little biased, because this is where I had my first date with my fiance. A friend recommended it, cause if the date sucked we could always play shuffleboard.

Well we totally rocked that shuffleboard and had some amazing beers as well. All of the brews are delicious. You won't find any bud here, but you will find delicious, fine craft beers.

The atmosphere is great for not only dates, but as a good neighborhood hangout. Is it worth it to walk from the G stop to check out this place? Oh, yes! They have good tunes playing and from what I hear, some great food too. The bar is very bright and inviting, especially with the huge painting of Michael Landon's head, Little House on the Prairie era. The backyard area is definitely unique with a small, grounded sky car off to the side, horseshoe in the back, and enough picnic table seating to hang out with a group of pals.

The service here is also impeccable. I mentioned that I had my first date with my  fiance. We actually used the bar for a private engagement party this past weekend and it was spectacular! Sara, our bartender, was A+ and happily accommodated everyone.

Thanks Diamond! You guys rock!

Hands down, one of my favorite bars in town.

The place is beautiful on the inside.  Very cool curved bar, awesome mural on the wall by the SHUFFLEBOARD TABLE (!!!) some pretty sweet art hung on the walls and an overall classy interior.

The backyard is amazing.  They have an old gondola from a ski mountain up by Lake Placid (see my photos added).  You can sit in it and smoke ciggs.  Or you can relax on one of the many wooden benches and picnic tables.  They also have a horse-shoe type game all the way in the back.  The back wall of the backyard is an old factory wall with ivy growing all over it.  The picnic tables are painted this awesome vibrant orange color.  On certain days in the summer (i forget which days, sorry) they have a beer-soaked bratwurst cookout.  For $5 you can get these enormous bratwursts that are delicious and juicy and right off the grill.  No joke, these are so juicy that a bite out of one of these brats spewed a stream of juice and soaked my friend's shirt about 4 feet away.

The drink selection is great, and they often have a beer on happy hour special for $3.  Nice wine and liquor list as well.

My only gripe with this place is the cheese and charcuterie plate.  The cheese is off the hook....you get 3 small slabs of cheese with it.  The cheese is great, but the slabs are tiny.  Check the chalkboard, the cheeses rotate.  Sadly, the charcuterie is a joke.  You get one thick flabby slice of some sopressata that resembled spam.  Nothing sharp or tasty about that meat whatsoever.  The guy who prepared my plate when I ordered it seemed to have no idea how to hold a knife, and made absolutely no attempt to slice it thin (how cured meat should be).  For $12, I was unhappy with the plate.  I devoured it, but wouldn't order it again.

Other than this sopressata travesty, this place f*cking rules.

My home away from home. Dave & his wife are probably the coolest in the neighborhood. The steady stream of quality beer, the warm & unpretentious ambiance, the shuffleboard & the backyard keep me coming back. At least once a week.

Some things that add to this awesome-ness:

The Diamond is always teaming up with neighborhood businesses for benefits, be they dance parties or bake sales. I was there this past Saturday for an incredible event - Kill Devil Hill representatives DJing and pulling out raffle tickets. The prizes included wares from many Greenpoint establishments. Amazing.

And the kicker? $3.00 chili bowls on Monday nights. Delicious hearty dinner under 5 bones? Hellz yes! Paired with a happy hour brew, or a Southern Tier Winter for $5.00, you have a solid Monday evening pick me up!

I love you, Diamond. I hope you love me.

Yeah. I'm updating this...again!

Dearest Diamond,

Usually once I get close to someone I suddenly find myself repulsed, and cut off ties immediately. Over the past year or so, this has yet to occur. With each rendezvous I feel more and more attached, this bond...it's frightening.

You refresh me with your Sunshine Pilsner, you entice me with your stouts. You fill me up. With your meat and cheese plate. That thick, girthy chorizo. That creamy brie, the bleu...the parmesan tasting cheese. My eloquence, and memory has clearly been affected by the feelings you've stirred up.

But this past Tuesday...you did something that I will never forget.

Your pickles...they are the devil! Wondrous, spicy pickles...heat lingering in my mouth after we have parted. It's as if you wish me to be thinking of you at all times! My other lover would never forgive me.

Please, Diamond, I beg you...stay shiny. Stay with me. Let's keep this going as long as we can. It just...feels so right.

Love,
Yours Forever,
Passionately,

Briana

I guess I should update my review...

This Saturday I came here with a group of friends that mysteriously grew larger and larger. Which was unfortunate because the Diamond was the busiest I've ever seen it. The bar area was crowded with plaid clad hipsters struggling to get a pint or a glass of high quality beer. There was no seating to be had inside or outside, so we perched ourselves in a corner of the patio, which really should have more tables or benches.

This is definitely the perfect place to stop for a beer on a warm summer day, or evening. The bubbling of conversation is soothing (outside!) and never overwhelming. My only complaint is not within their control - the closing of the patio at 12:30 am. Boo! I just want to smoke my butts whilst sipping my brew, be it an IPA or a Banana flavored Belgian!

YEAH, this place is awesome!

Fantastic staff, excellent beer selection, great wine selection, amazing, amazing happy hour.  I love it to pieces.  It's a bit out off the beaten path, but that keeps the hoi polloi to places like Berry Park (WHAT is up with that place).  Totally worth however far you have to travel.

It is not a huge space, but it's perfect - laid-back crowd during the week and weekends it's crowded in a fun way, not in an "I want to pull out my eyeballs with tweezers because I can't get a beer" way.  Another bonus, the many times I have been there, nary a douchebag in sight.  Woo!

Apparently they had to retire the Ladies Arm Wrestling for insurance reasons.  But that doesn't mean it can't still happen, unsanctioned.  Who wants to go?

Only came here for the first time last night, but was definitely favorably impressed with:
A) the super mellow atmosphere (one other person at the bar at 7.30 on a thursday night, and a few more outside).
B) the obviously super smart beer selections, many of which I had never laid eyes on before, including the only italian beer i have ever seen which is darker than a peroni, and a fantastic Kolsch in 0.2 L, $3 doses.
C) way personable and friendly service from the bartender.
D) rows of cassette tapes lining the bathroom wall, at least as eclectic a selection as the beer
E) the CHEESE AND CHARCUTERIE PLATE. which apparently is changed up regularly, but last night included of an incredible old pecorino, an downright evil blue cheese,  and a near candy-like brie.

we can't wait to go back for more awesome beer and the very promising-looking list of savory pies!

Awesome spot. Shuffleboard is a plus and reasonable drink prices. Will be back in the summer to check out the backyard!

Fun divey bar. Love shuffle board, so a clear plus.

Beer selection was great.

Not a huge food selection, but what they have hits the spot.
