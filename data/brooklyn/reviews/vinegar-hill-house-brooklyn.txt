I cannot believe I never posted a review until today because Vinegar Hill House is my (and my husband's) absolute favorite restaurant. For years now, it's been our go-to celebratory restaurant and we always look forward to their impeccable service, delicious cocktails and incomparable food -- it's seriously the best chicken you will ever eat! Finally, as someone with numerous dietary restrictions, I want to add that I am amazed that they always manage to accommodate me, even though the menu is so small. We cannot wait to visit the restaurant again as soon as the social distancing measures are lifted.

On a beautifully chilly Saturday morning we decided to venture to Vinegar Hill, Brooklyn. Upon walking in your greeted by the hostess asking for reservations or taking names. The environment was warm and eclectic; there was interesting lights and so many geodes(really cool rock formations look it up!)  all over the place. I felt very relaxed. The noise level was pretty calm, and it did have ample sunlight for pictures.

NOW for the main event! THE PEAR SOURDOUGH PANCAKES make me wanna cry from excitement! They were so warm and sweet and tangy. The pancakes were the butteriest and fluffiest I have ever eaten. I have been searching for pancake home and I'm never leaving. BEWARE they switch to apple every other week so call ahead to see if pear is on the menu. I was so upset they only serve one, but the guy next to me ordered two!!! I know for next time, its soo good and one leaves you wanting more two is the best number.

My brunch mate ordered the shrimp and grits and it was really good. I do feel that the shrimp could be bigger and have a more of a gravy but it was ok. The grits were the main attraction in my book. The were a course grind, full of that seafood flavor,and perfectly cooked.  The omelette.. was ehhhhhh.. underwhelming and could've done without. It needs to be improved. The egg is perfectly cooked it was fluffy and creamy. I just wanted more from the mushroom and goat cheese

Overall this was a great experience and i will be back for the double stack of Pear Pancakes

This place has been on my bucket list for a few years now and finally got there with 2 friends and a couple
Of cousins. The neighborhood is quiet you can find parking in the street
I have to say I was a bit disappointed. I don't like being charged for bread and butter, however it was amazing.
I also don't like being charged for sparkling water although I know it's a "thing " now with hipster joints.
The chicken liver mousse was awesome and probably my favorite dish however it was a tiny portion. The flavor was outstanding and the crostini was perfect. The octopus was also delicious but a really small portion

Main dishes- 2 had port chop which came sliced and rare. Delicious
Fish- hake - was told it was good. It came in a broth
I had the rigatoni with lamb Ragu. Also good but sauce was a drop overwhelming and tasted a bit salty

Desert- we had 1 of each-chocolate cake with the cream cheese topping. The cake was a little dry.
Panna cotta was good but extremely small portion

Just on the expensive side and we didn't even have drinks!

I'd heard great things about Vinegar Hill House and finally got the opportunity to come here last night for a work dinner. It's very cozy inside, and has that great quiet, laidback neighborhood restaurant feel. That said, I do not recommend for a dinner with your coworkers, as it's pretty small and you will essentially be sitting on top of each other and elbowing your neighbor every time you need more water.

We got the bread and butter, pear and arugula salad, and the octopus to start. The bread and butter was amazing - the whole wheat bread very fluffy but hot and crisp on the outside, and the butter had a slight sweetness to it. However, I cannot recommend ordering the bread if you're the one footing the bill, because they give you four small pieces of bread for $6. I get that New York has embraced charging for bread now, but $6??? I'm sneaking a baguette in my purse next time. Salad was decent, but forgettable. The octopus... meh. It was very tender but the sauce had an odd flavor and didn't seem to pair well with anything else on their menu. I am still annoyed I let the waiter lead me astray on that one instead of getting the chicken liver mousse, which I've heard rave reviews about.

For dinner, we had the cast iron chicken and the famous pork chop. As someone who usually avoids getting the chicken option at all costs (so many dry, sad, bland chicken breasts out there in this world), I was pretty impressed by the cast iron chicken - it's hot and crisp, a giant portion, and the meat is very tender. That said, be prepared to just eat chicken. I expected this to come with a few carrots or roasted potatoes, or something, but it's really... just chicken (I mean, there is an onion in the skillet, but come on). Which is very good! But not entirely satisfying to eat on its own. The pork chop is another fairly large portion, which comes on a bed of cheddar grits. I had a bite of this, and as someone who doesn't usually love pork chops (are all pork chops inherently dry, or was my ex just not that good at cooking them?), I was impressed here too.

We also got the sweet potato, which is roasted and topped with a generous heap of masala spices. It was good, but again, the flavors didn't seem to go with the rest of our meal, which was solidly in classic American territory.

Desserts, however, were a highlight. We had the chocolate Guinness cake and the earl grey panna cotta. I'm not a big panna cotta person, but this one was silky and the perfect density. The chocolate Guinness cake was basically everything I ask for in a rich slice of chocolate cake.

Had some misses, but overall enjoyed my meal here and really loved the atmosphere. Good place for a casual dinner with a friend on a rainy night, or some drinks and dessert at the bar. I also want to come back and try their famous pancake for brunch, as well as check out the outdoor space in the spring!

I'd been wanting to come to Vinegar Hill House since I saw it was rated as the most romantic restaurant in New York by some hipster magazine. So naturally, I grabbed a friend and came for dinner on Saturday night. It's a small restaurant, so make sure to make a reservation. Ambiance is quaint, dimly lit, and warm. Unfortunately, the food left me unimpressed and unfull.

Bread and butter - I can't believe they charge for this. It was indeed the best butter I've had in quite some time, but they also give you such a small portion.

Hake - light, small, forgettable, bland, simple. I mean, I enjoyed it - all three bites of it - but I wouldn't say it's worth $30! The price-to-market ratio left me regretting I chose this. The portion really was laughable. The few spoons of beans on the side were good and not too buttery.

Bourbon chocolate cake - good, but so dry!

It's more of an ambiance place, for sure. I was seriously let down by my entree, to say the least. Service was alright, but they kept taking plates away before I was finished, which is so rude. If I'm paying $6 for butter, you best believe I'm going to finish every teaspoon!

Cosy interior, friendly service. This place had never been on my list to eat, but apparently it was a trendy spot to go to a few years ago, and one of my friends suggested it for a catch up dinner, so we ended up here on a Monday night.
We shared the cheese platter to start, and each had one main dish. I don't normally order cheese platters at restaurants, but it was the beginning of a cold winter, and I figured I'd have another couple of months before it would be time to get my summer body back.
The cheese platter was actually a great snack to start off with, with crackers that I've never tried the likes of elsewhere. We finished these off quickly.
For mains, I had the fish, while my friend had the pork. I don't normally like eating pork, but Vinegar Hill's pork is excellent. The fish was a bit bland, and I wouldn't recommend eating this. There are no main dish options for vegans, and just one vegetarian main dish choice.
I probably would not come back here based on the food during this visit.

My friend and I decided to go to Vinegar Hill House (which is in Vinegar Hill, Brooklyn) it's a quaint little spot in a residential neighborhood. I'm telling you now that there isn't much around, and you might even pass by the restaurant if you aren't paying attention. But, once you go inside you will blown away by the interior, which is rustic and warm. The brunch menu was also unique and versatile. I ordered the Eggs & Tomatoes, which is basically Shashuka, and it was pretty delicious. My friend ordered their shrimp and grits, and they absolutely loved it. If you've never been you have to go, especially during the summer time

So cute! Outdoor space is very sweet and inviting. Menu is small, but what they offer is so yummy! We ordered the shrimp and grits, roasted potatoes and the pear pancake. Everything was very yummy. Only con was small portions for the price.

So I'd like to give this a better review.  Overall the food was really well done, and on par with what I had hoped it would be.

Then came the octopus.

We were there for my friend's birthday, and the three of us were sharing all the dishes.  The octopus arrived, a sad tentacle on the plate.  It seemed kind of like a joke -- $20 for that?  It wasn't a tasting menu, this wasn't le Bernardin.  I asked the waiter if that was actually all it was meant to be and he sort of bristled as if I was being rude to ask.

I spend a lotttt of money eating out in New York, but there is a reality that restaurants cut corners all the time.  It's at times egregious given when they're asking you to pay.  If they'd wanted to be gracious they could have replaced the plate.  Even if they're short changing people who won't mention it they could have saved face with me.  But they didn't.

If it were possible to adorn this establishment with zero stars, a thumbs down, a sad face, a photo of a dumpster fire, I would happily bestow such an honor upon this establishment. Alas, one star it is.

For those reading this review who are short on time, the essence of the complaint is that this establishment is not to be trusted and management sleeps on a bed of lies, as they say.  If you have an additional 30 seconds, read on dear friend, read on.

We negotiated an agreement with the event coordinator whereby my little brother's post wedding proposal and SURPRISE dinner jubilee was scheduled to held here. The evening, family only, was guaranteed-to-be full love, happiness, and of course the occasional tear of joy (likely mine) ...all commencing at 7:30.  We would eat, we would laugh, we would drink, and we would make memories never to be forgotten.  Or so we thought.  After negotiating the price, setting the time, picking the food, and arranging for a custom "Congratulations!" to be written on the top of the prix fix menu, I hung up the phone thrilled, knowing that the special day is soon approaching and that our siblings and parents, flying in from around the country, would have a place to join and celebrate the happy couple.  Apparently, management had other ideas. I received an email ..."not a phone, call?" you ask - correct, not a courteous and professional phone call... saying, and I'm paraphrasing, we're changing your start the time to be an hour earlier (mind you they know the proposal is ACTUALLY OCCURRING an hour earlier) and, oh by the way we're increasing the price.  If that doesn't work for you, "perhaps, this isn't the restaurant for you."  Needless to say, substantially changing the terms of an agreed upon arrangement and throwing us into a tizzy to find a new place without even the hint of an apology is abhorrent and a practice which, in my humble opinion, mandates a scathing review of what I can only describe as terrible business practices and a complete lack of concern for other human beings. And for that I offer the free advice of, "Try to do better."

Oh wait, dreams do come true...

I'll [try] make this short and simple. Vinegar Hill House is great! It's intimate, cozy and the food is delicious. The menu is pretty simple. (I've only been for dinner and it was a date with my boyfriend). If you're looking for a date night spot or just some yummy food and a drink with a friend then Vinegar Hill House is worth checking out.

I have to knock off one star though because of the Octopus dish. I'm not sure exactly what I imagined when I ordered it but I was super excited when I did and majorly disappointed when it arrived to the table... It was one tentacle with a couple of raw sliced vegetables next to it. Honestly it was comical my boyfriend and I just couldn't believe it was $20 for one tentacle. I think the dish needs to be revamped in someway. Might I suggest a puree of some sort, or lemon confit.. To make up for it we did order lots of other dishes.

Now for the star dish of the entire evening, it goes to the Chicken Liver Mousse. When I first read the dish on the menu, I thought yuck! Now way. My boyfriend was convinced we had to just order and try it based on how odd it seemed. The bartender told us it was very good and we wouldn't be disappointed and boy were we not! We have talked about this chicken liver mousse whenever possible, especially when talking to friends about food and places to go and eat. It's delicious and we will definitely be back just for that dish alone.

We will definitely. Thank you to all the staff who were very friendly as the service was also very good

This place is known for its sourdough pancakes and yes they do live up to the hype. The pancake is thick with a slightly gooey center, which I'm a big fan of, but the best part is that it's completely soaked in maple syrup. And if you think that's not decadent enough, they also add two knobs of chilled butter at the top which slowly melts as you eat the pancake.

Service was friendly and attentive. Decor is rustic barnyard chic (so hot right now). They have a decent drinks selection at brunch, including a delicious aperol spritz.

This was my first time here.  Set on a small cobble stone street in the vinegar hill section of Brooklyn.  It's situated between Dumbo and the navy yard.  The closest subway is the York stop on the F train.   It has the appearance of a quaint storefront with a warm antique feel inside.  There's a small bar used for dining and a mixture of 2 and 4 seater tables.  They can combine for 6 easily.

The night I was there the menu had a good mix of appetizers from salads, octopus, chicken liver.  I had the chicken liver and octopus.  Both were tasty and octopus perfectly prepared.  Both were pricey  at about $18 each.  I enjoyed the chicken liver the most served with freshly charred bread and frisée and pickled red onions.  Plenty to share with the table of 4.

The main choices ran the gamut of pasta, chicken , pork and fish.  I ordered the pork chop served on cheesy grits.  It was sliced like a fine cut of steak and done medium rare.  The pork was tender juicy perfectly seasoned and rich.  It was well worth the $34 price.  Entrees ran between $24-$34.  There were two sides and we ordered the eggplant.  It was good and well prepared.

Service during the meal was attentive and professional.  I can whole heartedly recommend this place for a quiet romantic  dinner, family gathering or small celebration.  For 3 people with 2 beers and 4 wines 2 apps 1 side and 3 entrees the meal cost $240 not including tip.  I think it's reasonable to expect $100 per person for dinner.   It's a wonderful fine dining option in Brooklyn.

Delicious food!
I ordered the asparagus, beets and Brussels sprouts for the table and had the Pan roasted chicken as my main entree. Everything was perfectly seasoned and very flavorful. The chicken was tender and moist with a wonderful thin crispy skin. The caramelized onions and sprig of thyme were the perfect touch..Served right in the pan! I tried the homemade sodas and they were absolutely refreshing! For dessert I had a cup of coffee and the olive oil cake which was the perfect finish to a well rounded meal. Good service,Fresh food and a cozy ambience. Parking was very easy to find so it's def worth giving this place a try if you're in the Dumbo area of Brooklyn!

We stopped in on a Sunday morning for brunch and sat at the bar. Paul the bartender was cool as hell and was very attentive the entire time without being annoying. We ended up getting the omelet and the shrimp & grits with a side of bacon and a side of potatoes. The omelet was packed with big slices of squash and goat cheese which was the perfect combo of salty and sweet. The bacon was plentiful and perfectly cooked. The shrimp & grits were a delight to the taste buds and the potatoes were a nice surprise topped with creme fraiche and tomato peppers. Of course we had to have Bloody Mary's which were good n' spicy and we finished things off with a few mimosas. Paul kept topping us off and he gave us each another complimentary mimosa after we paid for our meal! Lastly, he made a great recommendation when we asked where was a cool place to drink some good beer. He told us about The Gutter; a fun, divey bar with great beer on tap, good music and you can also go bowling. This place was right up my alley (pun intended) and turned out to be my favorite part of the day. Thanks to Paul and to Vinegar Hill for the great food and good time. Cheers

Brunch review: A pioneer in a very remote & interesting  area next to Dumbo. The restaurant is charming and I've been here twice for brunch with different experiences. Their brunch menu is very very limited and first time was less than impressed. This trip was long overdue and enjoyed their food at 55 Water St especially the roast chicken.
Ate:
Shrimp and grits
"the pancake"
Greens
The shrimp and grits are tiny sized yet tasty. No bread or greens unless you pay $13 for some salad greens so value- eh. Now on to the PANCAKE - a superstar made from a sourdough starter and cooked in a cast iron skillet. It arrives bubbling with butter and syrup and baked with tart apples. I got the small size which is perfect for one or two.This is pancake pleasure at its finest and a top pancake, which redeems alot of misses.

Extremely salty food. Random incoherent flavors and also portions. A menu full of unhealthy and/or unethical options (chicken and pork, pulpo and foie gras). Careless, rude staff. The hostess showered our menus and table with drinking water--no one wipes it off, ever. The wait staff is too busy demonstrating inflexibility and angst.
Terrible salad, forced $6 bread and butter (toffee butter ?! Absolutely horrible). Main courses, which are 4 btw, take around 30/40 min to get out on the table--unappetizing, unmemorable. Ugly stemless wine glass, then a white wine glass used for bubbly. Extremely expensive for what is offered. Two stars for charming warm setting.

A hidden gem that chefs up a pretty solid brunch. No clue this place existed as I don't really frequent that block and didn't know there were any restaurants there. Yelp! to the rescue when I was looking for a brunch spot. This place is a bit eclectic ... it's a house with sitting on the main floor, basement and out back. Really chill vibe and thus draws a brunch crowd. I would definitely suggest give it a shot. The burger was legit and the service was friendly.

Usually a favorite brunch place but was disappointed when I went yesterday. Their sourdough pancake is ridiculously good. But when I asked for extra syrup the response was: "it has syrup already." ummm ok # 1 don't shame me if I like my pancake drenched in syrup #2 did you really just charge me an extra dollar for syrup?? I mean...Plus my wife got  the squash omelette but the squash wasn't peeled?! Hopefully they weren't on their game because it's thanksgiving weekend and the real pros were maybe away?

I used to love this local neighborhood spot. Unfortunately I don't know if they changed owners or management but the service and quality of good has not been on par. We had a dinner reservations for 7:00 pm and the staff asked us to wait at the bar, which was not a problem. But ended up waiting for 40 mins and while they took other guests that looked like walk ins ahead of us! We mentioned something to the staff when we saw this but just explained that they were waiting as well. Anyways we finally got seated we ordered and service wasn't an issue but the food from what I remembered used to be 10x better. Lacking flavor and just nothing worth going back for. I don't think we'll be back here again until something changes. It makes me sad to say this because it really used to be an amazing spot.

Made a reservation for dinner Monday night for a quiet meal in a new area. Restaurant is tucked away in what looks like a normal home, including a quaint outdoor area optimal for summer nights.

After spraying ourselves down with insect repellent (free of charge), ordered the Roasted Shishito Peppers ($12) and a couple glasses of red ($12 each) to start. Peppers are marinated and covered in a tangy spice; easy to eat and more than enough to get the appetite going for two people. Wine is strong, as we tried not to finish the glass while waiting for the food (about 25 minutes). For the main course, decided on the Cast Iron Chicken ($29) - a large half chicken marinating in a supremely lemony broth and a few heirloom potatoes. The chicken is tender, with crispy skin to give a nice balance. I found the lemon taste to be a tad overwhelming halfway into the meal, but didn't want to mess the dish up with hot sauce.

To finish off, had some Alpage Sbrinz cheese ($7) and a coffee ($3.50). Cheese is very similar to parmesan, a fine pairing with the jam and select crackers. La Colombe coffee is always amazing.

Considering the amount of food ingested, the price wasn't as bad I thought it would be. Service takes its time, but came often to check on us and the food was definitely well-prepared (not thrown in an oven). Would like to sit indoors next time if not too crowded.

Similar to some other reviews, I really wanted to like this place but there were some serious communication issues with the staff. Our party of 4 was forgotten.  We sat at the bar while we waited and the bartender was extremely rude and not accommodating at all. We tried to be patient and did enjoy our food when we finally got sat but I don't think it's worth it.

4 stars for great food: squid ink pasta, kale panzanella salad and the beet dish were all very delicious, fresh and light!

5 stars for superb atmosphere. The backyard is so lovely, shady, and enjoyable. Absolutely worth the trip to Vinegar Hill to score a table in this yard.

Magic. I had dinner with two friends here last night and we were over the moon by the time we taste the first few plates we ordered.
We decided to share lots of small plates because we weren't sure what to eat, and I think we won, because we were able to taste more than an usual dinner. Every single choice was incredibly tasty between the acid vinegar salad, the grilled smoky octopus, the delicate asparagus with ricotta, fresh prosciutto and sweet warm cornbread.
We all got glasses of different roses and they were all good as well. To end, we shared a slice of chocolate Guinness cake with a top layer of cream cheese frosting, which was surprisingly really light! Not sweet at all, just cacao. Amazing. Can't wait to come back!

I've been here twice for brunch, and both times were amazing. The place felt very homey, but a little small because depending on where you sit, you could be pretty close to your neighbor.  Both times we got the sourdough pancake and pork and grits. Sourdough pancake here could arguably be the best pancake I've ever had. Pulled pork in pork and grits was tender, juicy, and flavorful, and perfectly complimented by the grits and tomato sauce. Both times those dishes were sooo good that I don't think I'd want to try other dished from them.

One note tho, the first time we came, it was a male server and he was VERY slow on everything, I had to wave him down multiple times to get coffee and water refilled, and order our stuff. The second time we were seated on the other side of the restaurant and a lovely lady was our waitress, and she was on point, quick, and very nice. The inconsistency in service is the reason I trimmed on star off them. Maybe train the male server a bit more?

What a gem! Cast-iron roasted chicken is the best I've ever had and our host gave great wine/cheese suggestions. The location can be tricky to find and the interior is far from spacious, but the food is great!

A one of a kind room, great setting for a meal. Have been many times since it's opening including recent dinner and brunch. While I love the light during the day, the brunch is frankly underwhelming.  Each dish we had needed something more on the plate. Dinner, however, is really great. Ate most of the menu with a group and loved it all. Simple yet delicious preparations with top ingredients. Excellent wine list as well.  Totally worth it if haven't been.

My husband and I hosted our Rehearsal Dinner here this past December. It was just breathtaking! The Carriage House has been renovated, and is an incredibly cozy, quaint, and unique space. We had nothing but incredible feedback from our guests, and our loved ones of all ages thoroughly enjoyed the evening.  The service was just phenomenal, as our team worked so hard to accommodate several requests. The night went without a hitch. We would, and often do, recommend this location for any private events as well as a meal! Great Job, Vinegar Hill House - we look forward to dining here again when we can. P.S. the Prime Rib and the Chocolate Guinness Cake ... some great stuff.

I went there on a recent rainy night and sat at the bar with my friend. The ambience is really special and the vibe is warm and cozy but the service and food were disappointingly sub par. The bartender who was waiting on us didn't smile once and seemed annoyed to even have to take our order. We ordered the liver pate (for $18) which was pretty good, although I've had better, and the portion was small with a few disproportionate pieces of toast. I didn't bother to ask our server for more. I ordered the lamb rigatoni ($26) which was tasty although a bit too salty and the portion again was very small. My friend ordered the hake which she said was simple and bland (at a mere $31). I won't be running back here. It was a lot of money for a very mediocre dinner.

Vinegar Hill House was named as having some of the best pancakes in NYC by Eater NYC, although only ranking 10 out of the top 15. Their sourdough starter is allegedly 60 years old. I'm on a bit of a quest to find the best pancakes in NYC and found these rather disappointing. The sourdough had a nice tang to offset the sweetness of the maple syrup and there was a very healthy dollop of butter on top for good measure, but presentation was decidedly lacking and the pancake was immediately made soggy by the syrup bath. It seemed like pretty average diner pancake fare.

Aside from the disappointing pancakes, the place had a nice vibe to it, reminiscent of something out of the historic part of Boston. It's got a certain rustic charm. There's no signage visible from the street so it's easy to miss, my taxi driver actually couldn't find it at first, and perhaps that's why I really hadn't needed to make that reservation. Either that or 11am on a Saturday is before the brunch rush, although that's certainly not been my experience at other places in my pancake quest.

I came here for dinner tonight with a couple of friends hoping to enjoy a "farm-to-table" type experience. Upon our arrival, we were asked to wait 10 minutes to be seated at a table that had already been open, set, AND reserved for us. Once we were finally seated, our waitress poured us a half-empty glass of water and proceeded to tell us which items on the menu were no longer available this evening, which just so happened to be all of the ones my friends and I were interested in trying. The waitress took off and didn't return for another 30 minutes to take our order from the remaining half of the menu. Of course, by the time she had arrived, yet another one of my selections was no longer available. I wonder why...

Alas, I was left to order the  "cheeseboard," Field Greens Salad, and cornbread for the table to share, and the Market Fish as an entree. The food was brought to the table another 30 minutes later, exactly at the point when all of us were starving. The "cheeseboard" was nothing to write home about and the cornbread was halfway decent--a bit too bitter for my taste. However, three bites into the field greens salad was when I realized that the main ingredient (the ham) was nowhere to be found. I brought this to the waitress' attention who then called the manager over and apologized to us for the waitress' inability to communicate that they had yet again run out of another item on the menu. At this point, I was left to wonder--how does one have enough salad, but not enough ham? Hmmm?

Our entrees arrived 15-20 minutes after our appetizers. At last, we've made good time! I took a few bites of my fish which came with a calamari ragout and my mouth was parched from how salty it was. It tasted as though the fish was captured in the Dead Sea and then broiled in the tears of a chef who had just failed out of culinary school.

Finally, the bill came and the manager was courteous enough not to include the half-assed salad we had ordered as our starter. Overall, this may have been one of the worst dining experiences of the hundreds I've had in New York. I came for "farm to table" and instead, I got a bull in a china shop.

Over all 3.7 stars. Take F train to york ave stop. Cozy rustic spot to gather small group of friends for dinner. The menu is limited but all pretty good. Our group of 5 probably shared half the menu.

I can't say anything was sooo awesome that would entice me to order again but most items were done well and satisfying. The prices are higher than expected and the location feels remote and easy to miss.

The skillet corn bread topped with butter is large enough to share (I would not get this if I was sharing with just 1 person).

The roasted chicken was tender and the onions were good.

The pork loin was super tender and served medium well with large slices and side of beans.

The chicken liver mousse was pretty good with caramelized onions on toasted bread.

The manicotti was personally my least liked. Everyone else loved it. It wasn't bad at all but I'm just not a huge pasta fan.

The tomato salad was refreshing and light.

The octopus was good but forgettable...i think it had corn and chickpeas that lightened the dish.

We tired the Guinness chocolate cake with was rather very good. The other panacotta with smoked strawberry had actually more savory notes.

I didn't care for the cocktail menu so I opted for wine..i got a voigner but I didn't like it.

The staff was attentive and friendly. Certainly pleasantly  surprising experience given the location.

This funky historic house in the Vinegar Hill  eborgood offers old time charm, eclectic and interesting decor, and amazing food. Unique offerings arrive with perfect portion sizes and deliciousness! Got the pear pancake, the jalapeño cheddar grits, and the goat cheese beet omelette. All were hot and perfectly cooked and Delicious! We split all three and were perfectly satisfied!
  The small sour dough pancake is about 6" in diameter and delicious! Probably could have managed the large pancake, but that might have been a little too much! The coffee was good, the servers nice and knowledgeable, and the service great. It was a mellow Saturday morning, and while they were nearly filled to capacity, it didn't feel at all rushed.
    Good background music, clean silverware and linen napkins. Go there!

Solid restaurant in the cut. Cool
Experience. Pancakes were interesting and delicious. Food portions are small but filling. Cocktails are yummy. Not easy to get to by public transportation and parking might be difficult but if you'd like to see Brooklyn, This restaurant and neighborhood is a must.

This place is perfect for date night. The food was exceptional -- everything we had was on point. We ordered: charred octopus, roasted beets, market fish (Bronzino), and the squid ink tajarin. They have an outdoor space as well so perfect
for summer. Enjoy!!

Great selection of natural wine. Cozy and in a quiet neighborhood, away from the riff raff. Limited menu but nice big portion sizes, delicious hearty fare.

Quaint, Cute, Rustic in what I imagine is an up-and-coming-redevelopment-area.

We arrived about 15 minutes before the door opened so we decided to take a stroll around the neighborhood. It was quiet with a feel of "please come and take me over and make be beautiful" vibe to it.  I don't know... it's just a feeling.

Anyways... when we walked back to the restaurant right when they opened, there were 6 other people standing in line out front.  Darn... guess we should have just waited, we would have been the first ones in.  Ha!

We were seated immediately upon walking in, so no worries. The building was a home, so that when you walk in ... what I imagine was the parlor is now home to several 2-tops and 4-tops that can be arranged depending on your party size.  We opted for the garden seating out back since the weather was so nice. The tables and chairs are what you might find in... surprise, surprise... a garden.  The ground is a little uneven.. cuz you are in a back yard setting ... so the table and chairs may wobble a bit.  Use your core and stabilize your chair. It's not that hard.

Service was cordial, but a couple times we had to flag someone down to get more water.

The food was ok.... my BIL and I had the eggs benedict which were a little lackluster in presentation IMO.  No small slices of fruit or a couple little berries or greenery to jazz up the plate... just the eggs benedict.  I should have taken a picture but I was super hungry and just dug in as soon as it arrived.  The eggs and prosciutto were fantastic tho!  It was served on an English muffin so ... not anything out of the ordinary. Hubby had the shrimp and grits which I got a small bite of and it was super creamy.  The BIL's GF had a green salad and a side of bacon.   The salad was nothing special but the bacon was tasty since she shared a piece with me. Portions were average.  So, if you are starving and are thinking that Brunch here is going to be your only meal of the day... I'd say order a couple dishes.  On the flip side, they don't give you huge portions so that you overstuff yourselves to a glutinous mass. Which in reality, we really should be more mindful of our portion sizes.  Anyways...

This place is cute and a great place to come that is OUT of the hustle and bustle of the city, so if you are looking for a place that is quiet... this is the place.  If you are looking to get your BRUNCH ON with hearty portions and a lively atmosphere, you may want to try somewhere else.

Vinegar Hill house is in a pretty remote location unless you live in Dumbo. It's been on my list of places to try, but always fell off at decision making time for its small menu. What's crazy though is that in my recent travels on two separate occasions, someone has recommended that I go as soon as I mentioned I lived in Brooklyn- so back to the top of my list it went.
I arrived at 10:45 on a Sunday (they open at 10:30) so there were still plenty of 2 tops available and no wait. I beat the person I was meeting, so I sat that the bar for a drink, and read through the NYTimes style section that they had sitting out to flip through.
When we sat, the waiter suggested that the top ordered item was their pancake so we ordered that, eggs Benedict and a side of potatoes since the eggs came solo. The pancake was for sure delicious, smothered in a big scoop of butter with apples baked in. Eggs were yummy but nothing to rave about at their $17 price tag. We enjoyed our meal, but I wouldn't be running back unless I found myself in the area at brunch time.
