Very warm atmosphere here! Staff is very friendly and helpful and service is fast. Upon entry there is an elevator that leads you to your theater. As you head up, there are comic-like pictures on the walls that gives the cinema its vintage feel. There are lights underneath your table to help you read the menu. Chairs are cozy! There isn't usually a line, but you can get your tickets online and just breeze right in.

This was my first visit to Alamo Cinema and I'm mad at myself for not enjoying here sooner. I took an Uber to the cinema and was a little lost but once I entered the building there were signs directing you to the top level for the theatre.

My date was on time and was just as shocked at the gem - Alamo Cinema. I bought the tickets online and chose our seats. So we were not stopped when we started our way up the escalator. We came to see Queen and Slim.

When we entered the theatre there were three ppl at the door showing you to your seats and where to locate the menus.  yes ! We ordered simple drinks; I had a frozen margarita and chicken with fries. The order came while the movies was showing but it wasn't an interruption since they took the credit card to start a tab. The server came back to ask if we would like fresh popcorn - oh hell yeah! Thank you Alamo You've made me an official fan. Next trip will be with my kids.

My friend and I really wanted to see a movie in the city and there are so many choices.  Many of which have absurd prices and should be shut down (looking at you regal union square lol). So we found this place online and she told me it was probably like the one in Yonkers near her and i would did it.  She was totally right. So it's quite possible that this is a 4 star instead of a 5 star because Ik spoils by going to Movie Tavern in Syracuse.

So the main issue I have here are the seats are just not that comfortable at all and are extremely aged. MT has full reclining seats and adjustable tables while having a stadium seating effect too.  So without all of those accommodations I can't give this place a 5.  The food is also the most expensive food I've ever seen at a dine in movie place. It's sad because it they were just 3-4$ cheaper I would have tried the food and I'm sure that there are many others like me.  Being successful is about pricing appropriately.  The staff are also kinda short tempered.

So that was a ton of complaints I know, but it really is a fun time. The screen is decent, they serve blue sky soda which is a huge perk, and the movie ticket price is very fair. This is also in a good area In brookyln so you will feel safe too.

I recommend coming here next time you want to see a movie.  I would recommend going to eat before coming though.

The concept of having a meal and watching a movie is harmonious. Alamo isn't the only game in town but it is one of Brooklyn's original.

Beyond having the luxury of a served meal at your seat you also book tickets (and seats) in advance. I can't go to the movies any other way. Long gone are the days of getting there 30+ minutes early to get the right seats for you and your family. Now you do this in the app or online and roll in just as it's about to begin (you can even arrive a little late if you don't mind missing the trailers and funny "don't text here" announcements).

The food is high quality and there's brunch and lunch options. There's also some yummy cocktails you can order. I'm partial to the bloody Mary's and the dark chocolate shake with vodka or tequila - amazing!

I've always dug the vintage vibe they have here with retro posters and speakeasy style bar you can hit Pre-show.

The only thing holding them back from a top 5 stars is that over the times I've been there they are hit or miss with service. We've ordered things that haven't arrived and it's a little difficult to flag them down during the movie (even with the system of leaving your card up to attract their attention). Things happen, but they weren't apologetic about it nor did they provide any compensation. Lastly, and good to know for families, they didn't want our 4 kids (all 5-8) sitting in the row in front of the adults. They claimed it was some policy which annoyed me and was BS. Other than that, it's a solid place to catch a flick.

We decided to check this place out. It's been open for some time but we never got around to go. Parking was a hassle. However, the trip was totally worth it. It was a really nice experience. We ate at the DeKalb Market so didn't get a chance to eat here. They do have a pretty decent food and drink menu. The seats did not recline which was kind of a bummer. Service was great.
Prices were reasonable. It was nice and quiet during the movie, which it always should be, however not always the case. They have a bar that you can hang out until the movie begins. Make sure to be there on time or they will
not let you in. I recommend purchasing tickets in advance. Overall, we enjoyed ourselves.

I moved to NYC from Austin so was so excited when a Drafthouse opened! I hadn't seen a movie at a non-Drafthouse in over 10 years for a reason. Love the pre-show clips, the service, and the giant bowls of popcorn. Besides my own home, I hate to see a movie anywhere else!

Love this place.  The fact that they are really serious about people not texting and talking during the show is good enough for me, but the fact that you can get food and drink (including booze!) in a comfortable seat makes this an excellent movie-going experience.

I've been here twice and enjoyed it both times.  The beer list is really good with an extensive selection of NY State drafts.  Craft cocktails are tasty too.   The food is hit and miss.   My chips and queso was "meh" and my pepperoni pizza was good but way too greasy.

Service has always been great.   I have to say, I'm a fan.

I have always wanted to try those bistro and movie type places and I finally found my go-to movie spot. Although it is in Brooklyn, it is easy to access if you live in Uptown Manhattan. The train stop takes you directly to the mall/movie theatre building.

The place is really spacious and clean and the customer service is by far the best I have seen so far! The first time we went here, we had a mix up with our tickets/movie theatre and they accommodated us at the bar and provided us free movie tickets for our next visit and got food at the bar complimentary! They really did the right thing by securing a loyal customer by turning our initial experience around. I had the pretzel and queso and chips from the menu and it was so good. The food is high quality and the seats are spacious and comfortable. Kudos to the manager that night for turning our evening around and for accommodating us despite the mix up!

If you come early or want to hang out after the movie, there is a bar on the first floor that you can hang in. They have loud music so not really a place to converse. You can also check out the Dekalb market with all the foodie spots if you want something else.

The second time I went, I had the popcorn, a fruity beverage, and the queso and chips again as I crave that spicey queso dip from time to time!

I will be a frequent movie-goer to this location because of the location, the service, and the experience. I highly recommend going to this place!

Came for an 11:15pm showing on a Friday night with a group of 8. Large theater with drink/food option delivered right to seat. Tickets checked at seat which was different and also nice. Ordered a margarita on the rocks which was not good. Had the largest and most buttery bowl of popcorn I've ever had.
They have a crazy strict no talking policy that borders on absurd.
Movie experience itself was fine.. good volume, lights etc.
price is steep and the food/drinks aren't cheap either. It's easily a 100$ excursion. I don't come to the movies often so can't say this experience convinced me to change my way.

It's a really good cinema. It's more expensive than other cinemas.
1. The cinema have waiters walk through to take your orders. Food orders are written on cards and left on the table. My server took a long time to get my card and when I tried getting another server to help he ignored me.
The seats are roomy and comfortable

I came here to watch a movie on a Sunday morning.  The theater is actually on the 4th floor in the City Point Shopping Center.  You have to write on the ordering card what you want and then stand the card up in the railing.  The tables on the seats were large but you can't move them.
I ordered the breakfast flatbread pizza ($14).  The portion was larger than I expected.  The pizza was delicious and crispy.  The food was pretty good.  The food was better than other eat-in movie theaters like CMX Cinebistro, iPic, AMC Dine-In, etc.  The service was pretty good too, there was always a server who saw the card up.  The only thing I didn't like was that the theater wasn't dark enough.  I guess it's for safety reasons since the servers have to look for the ordering cards and deliver food.  I did appreciate the lights under the tables though.  FYI - if you're a Victory rewards member, you get a free movie ticket on your birthday.

If a new movie is out, I pray they're showing it. Always an enjoyable experience. The waiters/food prep could be a little quicker but I get it, it's usually a packed theater.

The Parmesan truffle popcorn deserves 5 stars alone.

This is such a great theater!
My husband and I have been coming here more and more for date night since I'm heavily pregnant and more active activities just aren't on the table right now (ie museums etc). We've been able to see so many interesting independent films, animes (yes, we're dorks), and regularly playing "Hollywood" movies as well. This Friday we're seeing E.T. and the week after we're catching a 1970s Kung fu flick. For me, it's great since Netflix is so prolific it's nice to see something different or special in some way. Not to mention they serve all kinds of theater treats and snacks, meals, drinks and (for those who aren't imbibing at the moment) really tasty milkshakes : ). The staff is always great, too - polite, helpful, and willing to shush the odd talkative or giggly table. I'm so glad I live right next to this place. I even heard that they play "family movies", which is just regular movies an adult might want to see but not as loud so ppl bring their babies and don't have to worry about getting childcare or being embarrassed if they cry or whatever. This place kind of has/does everything if you're a cinephile.
Definitely download their app so you can keep up with their screenings and book in advance because tickets often sell fast. (But don't worry, you can get a refund or rain check if something comes up, how great is that ?!)

I. LOVE. THE. ALAMO. DRAFTHOUSE

This place can get all my money!

One of the many things that I love about the Alamo Drafthouse is the reserved seating--I want to know that I don't have to get there super early in order to get a seat. It's actually recommended to reserve your seat because oftentimes than not, they sellout of seats. Another thing that I like is dine-in feature. I've ordered several dishes from AD but I love the avocado toast. The chips and queso was good as was chili cheese hotdog. The flatbread was nothing memorable. I highly recommend the key lime pie milkshake (with or without rum).

AD is extremely strict about not using cellphones and talking loudly. They will kick you out--I mean, you spend almost $20 on the movie and then spend money on food, why waste time with the phone in your face? More importantly, why distract me with the lit screen from your phone?! Anyway, you try it, they'll warn you, you try it again, they kick you out. I love it! Also, you got to get there before the last preview is shown--they don't allow late entrants.

I'm so spoiled that I really don't want to go another theater.

We have been coming here at least once a month over the last couple of years and we like it.

The concept is very attractive though its not new any more. Some don't like having food along with a movie - the servers may be distracting, the sound of people eating whole meals may be annoying.

But for me and my wife this is about as comfortable as it gets. We get to have a full meal and get a movie out the way while we watch. We are not connoisseurs of movies to such a degree that we can't stand the slight interruptions.

Their truffle popcorn is especially good. And so is almost everything on the menu. One gripe is they give ketchup in an open small paper cup. And this is prone to being spilled - as evidenced by my stained shoes from a couple of months back. But that is likely more because I am clumsy and not representative of what others experience.

Shoutout to the creative 'turn off your phones' messages at the start of movies.

Love the concept of being able to enjoy a meal and a movie at the same time.

Tickets are about $17.50/pp. meals/apps range between $8-$25.

I got the bbq wings (6wings) and my friend got the hotdog which came with fries. They were both good ! The prices are a bit much but i mean ... for the experience, what do ya expect?

Drinks / Beer also offered.

I do think the seats area a bit small so it may be something to consider. Overall, a cool date night or chill experience. Must. Go.

Today I visited this theatre for the first time and  I truly enjoyed the experience. I ordered my tickets online , and I made sure to pick seats that were connected by a little gray line online so that I would be sitting next to my date instead of a stranger. After purchasing my ticket I went to the theater where I was only asked for my ticket when my waiter came to take my order. The lobby is full of books , action figures , toys and a plethora of books. One book that caught my interest was the history of various depictions of Black theatre art. Asides from the interesting literature the movie theatre follows a system . Patrons aren't allowed upstairs until an hour before the movie starts . Once it's time to for your movie of choice to start then you are allowed upstairs. There are many theaters on the second floor. I think eight theaters to be exact . I had the pleasure of watching a movie in theatre four which was spacious comfortable and had a large amount of space for leg room . The menu at this theatre is extensive and well priced . I ordered popcorn , the trick or treat cookies , barbecue wings and a root beer float which all came up to 45 dollars including tax. The food was great! The movie and surround system was great. The bathrooms were clean and very well designed . All of the staff members were very kind and accommodating ! I had a great experience at this theatre and I will definitely return .

PS there are bathrooms on both floors and in order to order food you must write your order on an index card with the pen connected to the table and place it in an area that is visible to your waiter.

I was eager to check out this dine in theater after hearing about it for a while now! It's upstairs in a shopping center so if you need to wait for a film you can check out target, etc. before or after while you're there. My friend and I decided to hang out at the bar inside the venue. They have a happy hour every day which is great! And you can even take your drinks with you into the theater. They have some crazy wax figures, some of which are pretty graphic!

The theater has assigned seating so make sure to book in advance or get there early to get a good seat. Even the last row still has a good view since it's really not that far back. The seats are very comfy and there are small tables between each set of seats where you can look at the menu and place orders. The staff come by and pick up your written order and then bring it out to you during the film. You can keep ordering during the movie as well. I found the prices a bit high but sharing something is a great deal. We went with the grilled cheese that comes with fries and it was good! Pretty decent portions.

I would definitely come back here since it's very easy to get to. Right off the Q train at Dekalb.

My wife and I really enjoyed our date night here. We enjoyed the food, drink and service provided. The wings were delicious, sweet Thai chili. Right amount of sauce and loved the char crunch on them. Our drinks were excellent, loved the many selections available. And their popcorn beats any other movie theater, evenly distributed butter and not greasy. Sound system was great. What my wife and I really liked was the very strict rules they enforce regarding talking, texting and cellphones. They will boot you out, no refunds! Kudos because we really enjoyed the movie without any jabbering in the theatre. Little on the pricey side but well worth it. Because of the strict rules, I don't recommend bringing very young kids here. Try it out, you'll enjoy yourselves. We sure did.

I LOVE this! I wish they had this upstate. A movie theater with table service! You can order food and drinks, the alcohol kind, and enjoy a movie while enjoying your lunch. The food was good. I ordered the popcorn with clarified butter. It was a nice sized bowl too so I shared some. I don't normally share my popcorn either.

I also ordered the blackened chicken Cesar salad. Nice sized bowl chock full of Ceaser salad ingredients and chicken. Paired with a nice cold Pilsner (all local beers on the menu!), it was perfect.

The service was quick, accurate and impressive! You fill out a card and pop it in a slot and they come by and take it and bam! Your food appears within 10 minutes.

I'm sure we in upstate will catch on to this fun way of going to the movies!! Hurry up already.

I've been here a few times, so I figure I should do a review!

Service: I tip my hat, and my wallet to the servers. They have to do their job, and be sure to stay out of the way of the audience, and they do just that. Be sure to tip them, being all sprinty and bending over constantly, just thank you servers for being so awesome and friendly.

Food: The food has always been super tasty, and the drinks PHENOMENAL! I had a rose milkshake, and I've been raving about it since.

Inside: The bar and stores are super fun to look around and find some odds and ends gifts (obviously a tad marked up, but its new york- it's business).

Con: ONLY complaint, is that the chairs don't really recline- so you kind of move around a lot to get comfy, and as most theatres it's chilly- but I tend to have a small blanket (literally child size) with me and no one seemed to care!

Went here for their Clueless movie event on September 12,2018. This was my first time ever going to an Alamo theatre.
Location: This is right inside of the complex where Dekalb Market, Trader Joe's and Target is located. The venue has a bar that looked super lively that you can go chill in and not need a movie ticket for. It also has a set of nice restrooms right there on that main level. The theaters are up the escalators in the lobby area that a part of their gift shop. There are also larger bathrooms up the escalator.

Protocol: Once you get in the theatre you can find your seat and sit. I found their numbering system a bit confusing so I asked an usher/waitress who checked my phone and instructed us on where to go. If you know how to find your seat alone when  the waitstaff comes to you they will verify you have a ticket and then take your order.

Menu: Fully extensive you can skip eating before you get here because you can have a seriously filling meal here. All we got here fries which were tasty.They also serve alcohol so you can get your drink on! The drink list is extensive as well.

Movie experience: The seats are very comfy and there doesn't seem to be a bad seat in the house... unless you're in the very front. I was in the last row seats 3&4 and we saw perfectly. It's stadium seating so no ones head was in my way! If you get cold easily bring a sweater or something because they spare no expense with the ac... maybe it's to keep the people who are boozing it up comfy.

FYI: After the previews, the screen announces that from that moment on it's a quiet theatre and anyone who is talking will be made to leave with no refund. No texting, no talking, no laughing or heavy breathing- okay I made up the last two! They also state if there is a loud table near you notify the staff aka snitching is now acceptable behavior in Brooklyn! This was a highlight of my experience because I hate talkers, texters and commentators at the movies. I'm happy to report that no one violated the rule and no ones phone went off during the movie! HURRAH!

Overall: I would definitely come back here for another movie in the future, but not too often since their prices are steep!

Alamo is great theatre in the heart of downtown Brooklyn. It's on top floor of a huge building which felt like a mall & it could be...I'm just now aware of it. Either way, this was my first time going to the theaters by myself & I truly enjoyed it. I went to see Spider-Man: Far from home and high was good by the way. You have the options to order food from your seats which is a nice touch. Comfortable seats & very spacious which are the two main factors for me in a movie theatre. They both were checked off so I have nothing to complain about. Will be coming back for sure whenever I'm in A mood to watch a movie in Brooklyn next time

I'm sure the movie theater experience is pretty good with all the four star reviews I am reading about. But we showed up for a screening and as the advertisement for the screening said to be one hour early. Exactly what we did. We stood on line with a bunch of other folks and waited an hour before the line started moving. Pretty much about two dozen people at the end of the line was given t-shirts and turned away because the movie we came for is full to capacity. Yup, my group was one of them. And they ran out of t-shirts. LOL. Terrible.

So, the solution was we put our names on a list and contact info on a sign up sheet for the next screening. It's been several days now and no follow-up. Customer Service seems nice but that doesn't provide a solution.

Anyway, we did check out the theater a little even though we did not catch a showing and it seems like any other movie theater. It is a small theater with leather seats and each Screen has an attendant. It also has elevators and and escalators.

The lobby has a couple of electronic kiosk to buy tickets and you can buy tickets with seating selections online.

I would consider returning to the Alamo Drafthouse. But for my recent experience it wasn't a let down at all but not good.

8/13/2018Andrew,
Sorry you didn't make it in last week. That was actually a private event hosted by a movie studio and was advertised as first come, first serve. We worked with them to get as many people into that free screening as possible, but ultimately we were at capacity and there just wasn't anything else we could do to accommodate the rest of the guests. But, I'd still love to help you out. If you're interested, please email me at mike.sampson@drafthouse.… and we'll get you taken care of.

Went to see Uncut Gems. This is my second time here at the Alamodrafthouse. It's a 3 minute walk from the 2 or 3 train. Cozy theater, it has that old school feeling to it. Nice decor. The movie was shown in theater 6. I picked seats all the way in the back. You can sorta smell the stench from the prep station where they dump out liquor, beer and cocktails. That's the only downside. But the theater itself was clean. Seats are alittle small. The service was great. This is my second time ordering a chocolate chip cookie shake and both times it came out excellent.  The items on the menu are very pricey but if your not in the mood for the food from the cinema,  on the lower level of the city point mall theirs a food court with tons of food options. I would definitely come back!!

Conceptual it's such a great idea. The idea of eating and having alcohol beverages from a restaurant menu than buying overpriced snack food is a phenomenal idea. Our waiter was great he explained how it worked. You simply write your order on the sheet of paper and place it standing on your table. There's a tiny light under you table to see.

Positive: The food was very good. Shockingly good. Not like a movie theater good but restaurant quality good. Waiter was great guy.

Negative: The wait staff walking around giving bills. I don't understand the arriving 30-45 minutes early rule- it makes the process extremely strenuous. On top of that wait, they showed very awkward previews. Lastly the floors were very sticky.

My favorite movie theater! If you're looking for a movie theater where you want to watch the movie, eat and drink in peace. This is the place to go. Their food is awesome. Their drinks great. The Parmesan Popcorn is oh so great! The best movie theater in Brooklyn!

I've only had lovely experiences here.

As many others have mentioned, the process of buying online tickets and redeeming them is very, very simple. As in, the last time I went and showed my phone screen to the friendly guys at the front desk, they glanced at it and told us we could head right into our theater where our server would check them again once we sat down. That's it.

It's great to not have to weigh the decision of waiting in line for snacks upon arrival and very easy to order anytime during a movie. Big fan of the fried pickles and milkshakes.

What I like most about this theater, though, is that although it's located on an upper level of a recently developed/very modern shopping center, the design team clearly made a concerted effort to make the theater feel truly...lived in. In a good way. Like the difference between the feeling you get staying in a room in a boutique hotel or Airbnb versus a sterile, uniform corporate chain kind of situation. It just feels like it's been there for awhile and it's a charming effect.

Moral of the story: very into this place.

Disclaimer: I'm judging this based on a private viewing where we rented out a theatre for our large group for a school event (~35).

Before this visit, I didn't realise I had actually been here before, on a random day when my partner and I were just avoiding the cold of downtown brooklyn 2 years ago. Flashforward to now with a school group, I was preparing for the worst - sticky chairs/armrests, shoes sticking to the floors, bed bugs in the seats, the smell of farts in the air. To my surprise, none of the above.

We went to guest services and the manager who was taking care of us came down shortly - he was extremely professional, courteous, and patient with 30 teenage children who were all itching for different things.

Our package came with unlimited fountain soda and pizza. I was imagining a stale slice of Costco Kirland off-brand frozen pizza microwaved, but we were actually served individual flatbreads each. I was THOROUGHLY impressed with this, though looking at the menu I was a bit taken aback by the prices - $10 for popcorn, $12 for pizza, etc. While I do expect the concession stand to be exorbitantly priced, these were incredibly inflated. However, we were given a headsup from the manager that should our children decide to buy anything, we needed to be wary because of "hidden surchages" - tax, and an automatic 20% gratuity fee for services garnered in our private viewing theatre. I appreciated the full transparency from their staff, and it made me really trust them.

The experience overall? Impeccable. I'd definitely come back here with another group again, and am interested in coming with friends/partner. The only thing that worried me a bit was that after one student got a wrong drink order, it took them about an hour to get the correct one in...Also, the "unlimited fountain soda" was a bit of a disclaimer because after the initial taking of orders, no one ever came back in - understandable, to give us privacy upon viewing, but they were no easily reachable outside the theater either.

This review is for vegetarian and vegan people! Alamo drafthouse has reasonably priced and tasty food for a movie theater. They also have a separate vegan menu and non junk food options such as kale salads and tofu quinoa bowls! The popcorn was somehow the worst of the options see below for breakdown:

Truffle parmesan popcorn: unfortunately the popcorn was semi stale and I was not a fan of tons of powder on my popcorn.

Prezels with queso: Awesome and flavorful queso.

Southwestern Tofu quinoa bowl: tofu was well seasoned and tasty! The top of the bowl was flavorful but the quinoa itself was bland. Could have used a bit more seasoning and veggies.

Grilled vegetable sandwich: Best item of thr bunch was surprised at how fresh bread and veggies were and how great it tasted. Highly recommend.

Such a cool movie theater experience!

What makes this place cool: They have so many menu options, including a wide variety of draft beers, cocktails, and spiked milkshakes. Comfortable seating and ample leg room. There is a waiter for each section.

Things to note: Early arrival is highly suggested. This will allow you to get your food right at the start of the movie. There's no entry after that movie has started. Additionally, this theater follows a strict no talking/ no phone policy while the movie is playing.

Overall, Alamo Drafthouse is definitely a nice way to switch up your movie going experience. While I may not become a regular, as this can become a pricey movie going experience, I look forward to coming here again.

It was a great Mother's Day outing. Amazing Bloody Mary cocktail. Unexpected, salted rim. I loved this twist
Deviled eggs and Flatbread to snack on!
I mean who orders Deviled eggs at 10.30am...

I saw Avengers Infinity War here. I'm familiar with the Alamo Drafthouse Cinemas having lived in Austin, TX.

I enjoyed my experience. Parking is sparse if you're driving here just FYI. Thanks guy a the ticket desk was pleasant enough I had purchased my tickets in my app so I didn't need much interaction besides where to go for my theater.

The lobby was well decorated. There's a backdrop of the city where you can take pics. The theater was very clean and the seats was comfortable. The menu could have a bit more option imo, however the appetizer menu is good if you just want to snack instead of eat. Of course  if you like beers the Drafthouse aspect will compliment your taste for that. The food service was quick and non disruptive.

I'm looking forward to coming back bere.

P.S. the movie was awesome that help too! That's my spoiler free review.

P.P.S there's the DeKalb Market Hall. It's pretty much a food mall. If you want to do dinner and a movie the economical way with way better options. I recommend to watch the movie and then head to the basement after to choose from at least 20 eateries!

I love Alamo and their concept. The idea of an intimate move theatre works for me every time! And you can order your food, drinks and snacks as you're enjoying watching the movie. We've discovered this place since we moved to Brooklyn 5 months ago and my husband loves coming back and biking the front toe seats with the recliners. It's actually quite ok. Food is alright and their milk shakes yum!
I've taken away one star for the overpriced gummy bears and popcorn that made me sick once because it's so buttery... but maybe I'm just not used to that.
Flat breads are tasty though.
Also their movies selection is slightly more unconventional and they like to bring back the good old classics.

I've never been to a Drafthouse Cinema so this was cool for me.
As we walked in I kept asking "but where is the popcorn?"

Note well: DON'T BE LATE! I was late by about six minutes my first trip here and the sign on the door almost had me in tears. "Late policy: NO THEATER ENTRY ONCE A FEATURE HAS BEGUN." I was well and truly early the day after I can tell you that.

Staff was nice when honouring seats for the next day. I guess they understand all too well the trouble getting street parking downstairs.

The experience was nice. I went to see BP and coupled with very tasty wings, popcorn and beer, I had a wonderful time! The servers were on point too. Almost cute as they darted through and fro during the show with backs bent as they proceeded to tables to retrieve orders from us without interrupting the movie.

Oh, no talking or texting. Yes!
Also, try not to get too close to the screen (especially if you wear glasses or suffer the occasional vertigo. It can be tricky.

I'll definitely be back.

The End.

My favorite movie theater to go to in Brooklyn. Big, comfortable chairs; available food and drink; plus an easy-to-get-to location.

Being as popular as it is, getting tickets can be tough. Multiple times I have stopped over only to be turned away by sold out shows (thankfully there's an eatery downstairs to pass time). However, the process inside is simple - get to your assigned seat, use the lights under the table to look at the menu, write what you want on the placard and leave visible in the space provided.  Draft list is fantastic and reasonable prices at $7-9. The popcorn ($8) is also solid - a heaping pile of buttered popcorn served in a giant steel bowl. My last visit, tried the Jerk Chicken Sandwich ($14) - a hunk of seasoned chicken on a potato bun served with sweet potato pies. Loved the veggies and bun, but the chicken was a little dry. Sweet potato fries are good.

As long as you don't mind servers running around (they do their best not to disturb movie watchers), then this is a great place to see a show.

I can't believe it took me so long to review this Alamo. I've been an Alamo Drafthouse fan since I first discovered this wonderful gem in another state. When one opened up in Brooklyn I thought it too good to be true.

I love everything that Alamo Drafthouse stands for.  No talking, no unaccompanied children, no cell phones, no disruptive people. Also there's a full menu of food and drinks. What more could you ask for from a movie theater?

The food is always good (but don't come here expecting 4-star cuisine, that's not the point), the seats are comfy, and every seat in the theater has a good view. Unlike other theaters that try to cram tiny seats in every available nook and cranny, the Alamo sets the screen far enough back that even the front row has a pretty good view.

Thank you for coming to Brooklyn, Alamo. Please never leave.
