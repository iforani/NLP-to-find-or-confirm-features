Was able to enjoy a quick snack here with friends this weekend. Pretty impressed with it.

Food: best Mexican street corn I have had at a NYC restaurant so far. Good balance between everything. Chips were delicious. Didn't get anything else however.

Service: our waiter was nice and we got our food promptly.

Aesthetic: sat outdoors so I can't tell you whether it was good or bad inside, but they did good with social distancing and had heat lamps!

This place is delicious!!! It's nearby my job and came here with my bosses for lunch. We got tacos and chicken burrito. The al pastor tacos are the best! They're delicious. I love al pastor with pineapples and it's the best combination. the tacos came with a cute little cast iron pan with rice and beans. it was so good. We also got their fruity margaritas on the rock and they were delicious. not too sweet! the food was the best part and the service was great. our server was super friendly and prompt. it didn't take long for our food to come out. i will definitely be coming back here again! staffs were following covid protocols as well.

I was so amazed at how the FiDi location was such a great time. The outdoor dining experience was a wonderful thing. There are no reservations, but when you get there expect a wait. But it's worth it.

My friends and I ordered the margarita tower and it did not disappoint. Pretty strong drinks overall and I was surprised. It says it meant for four people but I think it's meant for more. Definitely worth the money because it's like 4-5 drinks each. The food was amazing too. I ordered chicken tacos and of course chip and guac.

I have been yearning to bring my friends to this place and I will definitely be returning before the year is up!

Good find, If you like authentic style street tacos I highly recommend. I started off with an order of the street corn, very tasty. Then for main dish I had the al pastor tacos with a red sangria to drink. The tacos tasted excellent and came with a side of rice and bean. The red sangria was a tad small but delicious. A fun location.

I've been coming to Mad Dogs for years and always enjoyed myself! The staff is very polite and professional as usual! I ordered their version of the Bulldog Margarita and it was great, even though I don't usually prefer frozen drinks! My only disappointment was I didn't see the shrimp tacos on the menu! All of the tacos are delicious however! I'm glad to see one of my favorite bars hasn't become a casualty to this horrible virus! Continue to stay safe Mad dog staff!

Packed and loud on a weeknight. A good happy hour place if in the neighborhood. Took us a while to get a seat since we arrived prime dining time. Despite the place being full, service did not take long.
The two of us split the mango margarita pitcher. It came in a big big portion. We had to really work on finishing it. Our waitress advised us against the mahi mahi taco since it was a hit or miss. We settled for the steak and pulled pork tacos. They came with a small side of rice and beans which i didn't mind. Food was overall pretty decent. Would come back for drinks and definitely to get guac next time.

This place is ALWAYS full and has a really stupid policy. If you are not having an entree you cannot have a table. That is nuts! I came with a party of 5, we were going to buy drinks and appetizers but simply could not find a seat at the bar. We asked the waitress if we could get a table and were told 'no, only if we are ordering food'. We were going to spend at least a few hundred bucks so they lost out on that. We left and went to another spot nearby and had a great time. Change that stupid policy; you are losing out on business!

I did go back and was able to have lunch one day with a coworker at the bar. I had enchiladas as well as (2) guava margaritas.  The margaritas were simply OUT OF THIS WORLD! I was intrigued to try a guava margarita and it didn't disappoint! Kudos to the bartender! The enchiladas were just so so. Didn't have great flavor. The rice and beans were good. My co workers tacos were good too (in her opinion). The place has a nice lively vibe but is always full no matter what time you arrive. Their table policy is stupid and the bar is cramped. If you going for a quick bite and don't have time for a meal, pray you get space at the bar. Otherwise you have to buy an entree to just get a table.

  Thank you for coming back to see us! You may sit at the tables if you are having drinks & appetizers :) We prefer to save the tables for folks who would like to eat, otherwise we would lose a ton more business via no where for our dinner guests to sit down & enjoy their meals. All we ask if that you have food as well! Please let our hosts know that you will be ordering food & they will gladly set you up with a table! Any issues & you can ask for me, Christina (I’m their general manager) Hope to see you soon!

Thanks,

Stopped by with some friends on a Thursday evening. The outdoor seating is first come first serve with about 8 tables, two underneath a tent. It was very crowded and hard to keep your distance from others. You can also walk inside and order takeout from the bar. While a majority of the tables are on Stone Street, there were a few tables on the other end of the restaurant where you can sit after ordering takeout. It was much quieter and we felt safer to eat here. Food was average Mexican food; nothing special. Our pitcher of margarita was very strong and well worth it!

So I didn't have the best experience at the location in midtown, but decided to give this location a try with a couple of friends as it was across the street from a cocktail bar.

I ordered the mushroom quesadilla because the other location is known to have excellent mushrooms and flavor however this one used canned mushrooms and did not have any flavor. They did take it off the bill so I do appreciate that.

My husband got the chile relenos & did not like it much. Lacked flavor and texture.

Our friends got the cheese chimichanga - they were good. Smaller app portion but good enough to be full and not have to take home leftovers or waste it.

For apps, we got nachos & corn which were good.

Not the best Mexican food I've had, but does have a fun vibe & indoor decor as well as music & margs.

Seriously just the best I've been obsessed with this place for years. The marg towers are my absolute favorite. The food is really good too my personal favorite things on the menu are the guac and the wings. They have plastic straws which we LOVE. Also great coronavirus to go service.

I am a big fan.  Located near Wall Street downtown, historic area of Manhattan called Stone Street - full of outdoor seating, original brick - or maybe stone?  LOL  this street has the vibe of old New York, and that is enough for me.  However it is packed like sardines down here!  There are like 15 restaurants, bars etc you can choose from.  I get into Mexican food always, so this is a natural choice for me.  Street Corn is a NO, I found it soggy and over dressed with cheese. I much prefer my favorite place on Elizabeth street, but that is for another conversation.  Steak tacos were dry but acceptable.  Guacamole is super fantastic!  Service is Tremendous, which I appreciate on a hot summer day sitting outside hungry and thirsty.  Food is reasonably tasty, it is acceptable considering the location and ambiance/  Wonderful tequila options (let's get the priorities straight right?). This is a solid choice.

I always want to like this place but every single time they drop the ball. The food is always 3/10. Let me also add that they charged us $4 for a spicy rim on our spicy margarita - not to mention he didn't even tell us it was and extra charge? Ruben could have done better. Come here if you're drunk and can't taste anything I guess.

3/13/2020Hi Alexis! We’re sorry to hear the food you ordered didn’t live up to your expectations. Did you express the concerns with your server? We are of course always happy to switch out your dish for something else that you might like better! And yes we do charge $2 extra to add a flavor to your drink — not $4. You ordered two drinks with extra added flavor, so it was $2 per drink, which comes out to $4 total for 2 drinks. Our Spicy Marg has fresh serrano pepper purée added to it, which is what we charge extra for. We appreciate your feedback and please feel free to reach out if there is anything else you thought we could’ve done better. Thank you!

My coworker made reservations for a 12:30pm group lunch and I'm so glad she did! When we arrived, we were escorted to the 2nd floor. About 30 minutes after we sat down, it was packed. Completely packed.

We ordered guac and chips for the table to share as well as Mexican grilled corn. Both were really good.

I had the steak quesadilla and it is such a large portion. I definitely did not finish it.

We also had a pitcher of their pickly pear margarita, which was really good. Highly recommend!!

Service was attentive and friendly - despite the fact that there was another large group on the 2nd floor. We never felt ignored or neglected.

Headed here on a Wednesday night to take advantage of the nice weather and plethora of restaurants offering outside seating. Mad Dog is the only Mexican offering in the area, so quickly went over and got a table for two at one of the long table-benches.

While looking through the menu, didn't see any happy hour deals, nor any free chips and salsa to start (Downtown Manhattan woes). Instead, settled on the Blackberry Margarita ($14) and the Pineapple Avocado Salad ($13). More expensive than one would like, though most restaurants are around that price point. Drinks come first - the margarita is a frozen ensemble of tequila and artificial fruit juice. Could have been a better flavor to balance out the tequila. As for the salad, the grilled pineapple is a nice treat, and the accompanying sauce made the mix of greens more palatable.

Service here is actually really good despite the servers having to work the indoor and outdoor crowds. Not a place I'd try often due to the prices - fine enough for a drink to end the night.

Mad Dog is a great spot located in FiDi with the perfect happy hour menu. I haven't had a chance to try the food here yet, but the frozen margaritas are super good! The service here is pretty good and the bartenders make the best drinks here.

I heard they have a massive margarita tower here, which I'll definitely be trying when I have more friends with me!

I'll be back again soon!

Ehh I can take it or leave it. I came in with a few friends on a Saturday night. It wasn't packed, but we couldn't immediately get a table so we sat at the bar. It took a while to get the bartenders attention, but the first round of drinks were solid--I really enjoyed the blackberry margarita, and they seemed to enjoy their sangrias. I wasn't as impressed with the sickly sweet mango margarita I tried next and would've stuck with one of their more unique margs next time.

Unfortunately when we tried to get the bartenders attention to order food and another round, it took almost half an hour and two separate requests from us asking the other bartender to get her to swing by.  It didn't seem PACKED, so not sure what was going on down there. We skipped dinner, but might be convinced to come back if we can get a table with more dedicated service.

Great spot with the best guacamole! This place does get crazy after 530/6 when ppl get outta work.

Got the steak tacos, guac, and marg. The guacamole wasn't made at the table which is sad but was amazing and fresh.

The margs were small but they're known for them. Def have to give them a try

Absolutely worth every penny. I've been here numerous times & always wanted to try out the Margarita Tower. *Let me be clear that the tower is sold to a party of 4 or more*  .. this tower is worth the price! It is priced at $115 and it can not be frozen nor if you ask for it without any ice, you'll get more fluid. We ordered the Guava Margarita, which is my new fav I think everywhere I go now. It's strong. Each person can take down 3 to 4 1/2 depending how it already has you feeling. If you thinking about it, give it a try at least once!

I've been wanting to try this spot out for some time already. I work near by & I've heard many good news of this location. Let's start off with those delicious corn on the cob pictures that others have posted. I have to admit I've never tried it but on this evening, I swear it was the best dish on the table. I also tried the shrimp tacos, dish comes with 3 small soft shell & a small order of yellow rice & black beans. I came with friends so we doubled up on the guacamole, which is made fresh, great portion & very well seasoned. We were seated upstairs for dinner, with our own bar.  The food came out at a decent time being that it was a packed evening. The location is well spaced out, downstairs seems to be more active by the music & limited seating. The drinks, oh that Sex on the Beach was so good. We each had 4 @ $10 cost each, they were strong & kicked in quick. The service was great, our waitress was attentive & friendly she was quick with getting our drinks. Inside decor is cute with a 'Dias de los Muertos' decor theme. The pop of color went well with the restaurant. I spent all weekend thinking of that corn on the cob! But we'll back soon for more drinks!

I like the happy hour deals that they offer at Mad Dog. Came with a group of colleagues midway for a conference nearby at FiDi. We each got a margarita - I got the coconut margarita. I really like the coconut taste to my margarita, and boy the $7 per margarita special was definitely good. The drink itself was a little bit acidic from what I would expect for a coconut margarita.

Service was rather mediocre IMO, the hostess wasn't really helpful in terms of explaining where we can sit to enjoy these happy hour delights. We had to ask a few waitresses and the bartender to figure out the happy hour was only restricted to the bar section.

Overall? Great happy hour selections. Drinks were a tad bit acidic for my taste, but I guess thats what you get for margaritas. Would come back!

If you order beef burrito it is really steak. They don't tell u that. Be aware. Checks can only be split up to 6 times. Even for 19 people.

The burrito comes with all this extra sauce on both sides. Make sure you tell them sauce on the side if you don't want a wet ass burrito

Update: one of the sauces is hit ass hell again for a first timer no one told me that it comes with hot sauce on one side

Update 2; I'm still eating no cheese or lettuce in these burritos either just steak that should be ground beef rice and beans.... no worth the hype ...should have got a $2 pizza

Update to the update: Anything that says beef is really steak don't be fooled. She told us she could only split the checks to 6 but I guess she realized she gets more money making it individually ...Don't trust these people

After the waitress realize her tip would be bigger she Split every single tip up individually...interesting LIE

11/24/2019Hi Deprina! Thanks for the feedback, and we’re sorry about the confusion. The word ”Beef” actually just means meat from a cow. ”Beef steak” and ”ground beef” are two different types of preparations of beef. It doesn’t say anywhere on the menu that the burrito has GROUND beef in it, it just says beef. Which in our case means beef steak. We always recommend asking your server for details if you are wondering about how things are prepared! And the reason we can’t split up a bill 19 ways is because it would take too long and slow down service for the rest of our guests!

The only reason this place is still in business is because of the stone street environment. If you are looking for Delicious Mexican than do not come here and do not order salsa. It's literally pico not salsa. So stupid.

The fajita is gross too. Adriennes down the street is so much better. Service was awful too.

One of my favorite places to come to in the city. My server Lorena always takes great care of me and the manager Christina always comes to our table with a warm greeting. The bartender Paco makes my margaritas just right everytime!

Came here on a Thursday with a friend. Unfortunately missed happy hour but that didn't stop us from ordering some frozen margaritas. Not my first time here. The margs are great. Really have a great punch and refreshing at the same time. Asked for chips and salsa, which we were charged for. Idk, maybe it's just presumptive, but most Mexican restaurants give them complimentary. Oh well. It was tasty and worth it. Wanted to order the guacamole but I thought it was so over priced. If my memory serves me right about 14 dollars. Glad I passed because when I ordered my steak enchilada it included a serving of guacamole. The guacamole was great. The enchiladas was also very tasty. Service was good as well. Also ordered the churro with tres leche dip. Amazing. Served with blue berries and strawberries with a bit of powered sugar. Over all good eat. Can't go wrong

Came in for a quick drink and some snacks before my wife and I headed do a few things in the city . We sat at the bar luckily Nicole our bartender informed us that it was happy hour and suggested the guacamole. It was probably one of the best guacamole's we have ever had. Nicole was super friendly. Next time we are in  the financial district stopping here is a must.  Great guacamole and great staff. Side note strong margaritas.

Really missing mad dog I was really hoping to get back there when the weather got nice again but ever since COVID-19 I can't but upon reopening whenever that happens we will certainly make our way back . I've been craving that Guacamole ! Could go for some right now..

Found this place while walking along Stone St. Decided to stop on in because we saw a table with the beer tube of margaritas. There was only 3 of us so we opted to get a fishbowl. I'm not a fan of frozen margs and they were able to give it to us on the rocks even though it wasn't on the menu. It was super super strong, too. Had to keep pouring water into it to drown the OVERWHELMING tequila taste.

The food is good. We got an order of mild guacamole for the table. It's more on the lumpy side. I ordered the steak tacos which come 4 tacos and a small side of rice and beans. Surprisingly filling despite their small portion.

My biggest gripe with this place is their speed. Takes forever to get a table, even if there are so many open and it takes a long time to get approached by our waiter/waitress. We were having good conversation which kept the time going, but we definitely noticed how long it was taking.

Came here on a Monday night and service was great. Tables are set up outside and there is no indoor eating at the moment due to Covid 19. The margaritas are still amazing and the food service was pretty fast. Our waitress was pretty awesome and checked on us frequently. They didn't have a highchair for outdoor use for my child, but we still managed to enjoy ourselves.  The nacho sampler was so tasty, and the hot wings are super spicy and flavorful.

Yum!!!! I'm a fan. Drinks were delish and so were the entrees.

We ordered:
- pitcher of classic margarita - enough for 6-7 glasses of marg
- guac to share never a bad idea
- 2 Tampiqueña steaks ($22 chargrilled skirt steak) - AMAZING, so flavorful, well seasoned, and honestly just really hit the spot
- chicken burrito bowl - which I wasn't SO crazy about just because it was a bit heavy with all the rice we already had at our table, wouldn't order this again

Very reasonable prices, generous portions, and great food! Will return :)

Loved this place!!!
We were a group of 10 Ladies and as soon as we arrived they prepared tables and seated us within seconds.

Loved the attention from our waitress.
Loved the fast service of the kitchen.
Loved the decoration!!

But specially, I really really Loved the ambiance.
We were seated right in the middle, on the second floor, surrounded by other tables and some other groups. Loved how festive it felt. They were playing awesome Latin music, we were celebrating a birthday and my farewell.

We ordered many appetizers to share among the group. Everything was exquisite. The guacamole was my favorite over all the others. It was perfectly made, not salty but flavorful, not too spicy but it had something that felt spicy and tasteful at the same time. Guac was also acid enough for you to LOVE it.

We had two or three Margarita Towers to share, they are very tricky. A mixture of sweet but really strong, so be careful. :p

I am really really really looking forward to come back soon.

I came here with boyfriend for dinner the other night. It was surprisingly crowded for a weeknight, but we were seated right away. Like most of the bars on Stone Street, it was pretty loud, but we didn't really mind.

We each got fajitas, he got steak and I got chicken. It was a decent amount of food - I brought half of mine home for leftovers. They bring you the typical sides: guac, tomatoes, etc. I'd say for the amount of food you get the price isn't outrageous. Good spot for groups, but not a good date spot.

Pretty average Mexican food. Prices were fair, flavor was mediocre, and service was fine. You basically go here for the Stone Street ambience- come with a group and sit outside on the picnic style tables and have a good time. Margarita towers were alright and are more for show.

Came here for a friends birthday party with a group of approx 15 ppl, had a reservation and got this little corner with a table and approx 6 seats??
It's appropriate to say it was uncomfortable for people to just stand or sit or where to put my drink and food??
On to the food we got Guac and chips which was $25 for double had legit no flavor. The chips were freshly made they were still warm when it was served. For drink I got elderflower cocktail, it was described as fruity floral but legit reaked of mezcal, which I being a picky drinker didn't enjoy. My friend had passion fruit margarita which was more palatable.

Overall nothing to write home about as you can tell by the overall rating of this place. I have been to pretty solid places serving Mexican style fare. And this one is not to be bothered with.

Love this spot! The margs are always good along with the chips and guac. I got the chicken chimichanga and shrimp tacos and they were really good too. It's just really hard to get a table outside and service can be slow when it's very busy. But overall this is the best spot on stone street and I always look forward to coming back!

Visited with a few friends after getting our drink on at happy hour.

The food was pretty good. I had the plantains and the corn, both delicious. The queso dip was just OK and could have been alot bigger.
I had nibbles of everyone else's meal(s) tacos and such- all seemed to be good.

The service was great, our waiter was extremely attentive and made our collective experience more enjoyable.

The main issue I had was the margarita tower- It was filled with SO much ice that I didn't really feel like it was worth the price. I also felt as though the glasses they were suppose to be served in were quite small. I'd recommend skipping the tower.

While this place isnt the most expensive, its also not the cheapest. I don't know if I will make the effort to come down to FIDI to try this place again, but its not bad by any means.

Side note, the back patio/alleyway is cute perfection.

4/5

8/20/2019Hi Sarah! Thanks so much for the detailed review!! We are so glad to hear you thought the food was good and that the corn and plantains were especially delicious :) Our 100oz Margarita Tower is priced at $115 and fills 10 glasses, so it comes out to $11.50 per margarita! Our regular House Margarita is priced $13, so we actually think it's a pretty good discount. We hope to see you again next time you're in the neighborhood!
