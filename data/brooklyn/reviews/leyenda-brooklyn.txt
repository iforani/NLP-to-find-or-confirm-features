I love this bar! They are doing everything they can to keep their employees and guests safe during COVID. I'm so thankful they are doing cocktails to-go and have patio seating!

I've missed their food and cocktails so much!!

Came here for a birthday brunch
Staff is very friendly and took great covid precautions at all times

The drinks were very unique , and they had a great variety .
Sonambula is a great spicy margarita, for those whose enjoy the spicy kick
Mimos Corazon is a perfect twist of a mimosa

I absolutely loved the steak and eggs , just wow! Their chimichurri sauce hands down is one of the best I've had , perfect flavor !

The churros we all shared for dessert and those were amazing !!!!!

Leyenda has nailed it every time I go there, and they didn't let down during covid cdc regulations.
It is a good place for sharing tapas and fun cocktails. Since its connected to the Clover Club it is no surprise they have creative, refined, interesting drinks that taste smooth and often come in decorative glassware.
I have enjoyed the shrimp arepas, they are some of the lightest ones I have had.
The chips and guac were good but the guacamole is only enough to fill a half avocado which it is served in.
This time we got the pupusas which felt night and light since they are vegetarian, good for sharing.
I really thought the al pastor tacos were tasty especially once the lime and cilantro are added.
The Brookyn Burro drink was so light and refreshing! I ordered a second and they forgot about it but we had already finished our meal and they had a one hour seating limit anyway and they didn't accidentally charge us either.
Service was friendlier than ever, and it was helpful that they specifically described the behavior required and why they made certain accommodations. They explained they were only giving 1 menu per table to save paper since they dispose of them. The menu explained how they sanitized the tables after each party left and they would like people to wear the mask when a server came to the table since they interacted with so many people in a given day.
They still have their backyard but it is more spread out and they added street seating.
I would come back again soon!

There is plenty of outdoor seating out in the front and also in the garden. We sat at a high table for three in the front. We loved the food! The shrimp arepas is a must order! It is so delicious, crunchy and flavorful. Would love to order 2 just for myself! For the table we shared family style, chips and guac, chicken tacos, skirt steak (DELICIOUS MUST ORDER!!) and seafood ceviche. The seafood ceviche was different with pomegranate and not your conventional way but we liked the twist and thought it tasted great!

The cocktails are fun, I order a frozen cocktail that was lit on fire. Loved the presentation, smooth fruity cocktail was so good. It reminded me of a pina colada with mango purée. My friends also got several rounds of other cocktails that are all worth a try!

Service seemed a bit off that evening. Super lagging (from what we saw it was not busy) but we had each other's company and didn't mind the wait. After all the drinks and food made up for it. Would like to come back!

What a disappointment. We stopped by here because it was packed with people, but this place fell flat and I should've paid more attention to the clientele.

The host is really nice and attentive, but the waitress was ehhhh. First off, you have to wear a mask every time the server comes to the table. Keep that in mind if you plan I'm ordering an app and entree, plus drinks.

It took nearly 10 minutes for our waitress to come over to take our drinks and app down. They came at a decent rate, but we sat for like 20+ minutes and she never returned to take our entree order. We tried to flag her down but it seemed like she avoided eye contact. All we had was a frozen margarita and chips and guacamole.

Portions are small, in my opinion. But, the drinks were good. Overall, it felt weird being there (as the only non-white person) but what was even weirder was how quick they were to get our check and take it back when we finally caught the host's attention.

You're probably better off eating a few doors down at Purapecha. More diverse clientele (which is more trusting), better prices, better service, and though we didn't try food at Leyenda I'm sure the food is also better.

I randomly stopped by the other evening for a drink, and wow was I impressed. The Headless Horseman cocktail - which is both frozen and on fire - is one of the most delicious drinks I've ever had. I will definitely be returning here.

Leyenda definitely fell short of our expectations. The staff was friendly but the menu definitely needs some revamping. If you want variety, this may not be the place for you. My friend tried to order the steak and guess what? It comes by itself and no sides are available! There aren't any sides on the menu at all. We ended up getting guac and chip and croquettes as appetizers and then going to a near by restaurant for actual food. The croquettes were ok--the guacamole was way better. I'd never come back here for dinner, maybe just for drinks and an appetizer. Also, if you go during the summer, bring bug spray. We got eaten up :(

Disappointed. Staff was inattentive. Bacalao was soggy, ceviche was more veggie than fish, croquettes not the same as before. With limited social activity and multiple small businesses to support, we probably won't make the effort to find the time to come again. Bummed, it was close to home and one of our favorite spots pre2020.

Been coming here for years. Love the outdoor patio in the summer. The food is delicious.
I never noticed they carried one of my favorite rhums-Clarin.
The service is always great.
Highly recommend.

Leyenda was nice! I went right before Christmas for my friends birthday. The atmosphere was really festive and they had a great ambiance. It was decorated very for the holiday season and the cocktails were also on theme which was cool.

With that being said, this place is 100%  a bar vibe with tapas food. The food was good but I would recommend not going here if your very famished because you won't be full from one meal and the food is a bit pricey for the quantity you get. It's a nice for a group chatting but there is no formal table seating.

Additionally, our waiter was not friendly at all and really made us feel uncomfortable ordering most of the night. Not sure if she was having a rough day or what the case was but she definitely shouldn't be waitressing if she wasn't going to be pleasant. It really made the vibe negative and made us reluctant to make orders.

Came here for birthday brunch and sat outside. Great service & great food!

I got:

steak & eggs- so delicious, the meat was so tender and juicy.

Churros- also delicious

Leyenda bloody- a carrot juice base (I think) "Bloody Mary." With the the option to choose your liquor. It was spectacular!

Mezcal- on point

We have came to Leyenda before. We got the idea from visiting Clover Club their sister lounge/restaurant across the street. The cocktails and food are delicious there and we wanted a simpler experience.  Leyenda is a Mexican inspired tapas/cocktail bar.

Our first experience we came early got a seat at high top table and it was somewhat pleasant. The food and cocktails were okay and was willing to try it again and here we are.

We entered the establishment and no one was there to greet us. It was little later then last time but We did see some empty tables and was happy about that. There wasn't many people standing around so we thought we would be lucky.  A host came rushing over when we were going over to a table and asked if we would like to sit. We said yes and he said 45 mins. It was weird because there was just so many empty tables plus we heard they have a outdoor area.  We put our name down and saw seats at the bar and sat.  We figured if we can sit at the bar and eat why sit at a table. We ordered drinks and food and there was three tables that were empty for a good 30 mins. Really upsetting we couldn't have been accommodated.

We order a some mixed drinks from the menu a Tia Mia and a bourbon type drink. Both were okay. They were fruity and thoughtfully prepared by our bartender.

We ordered for dinner: shrimp arepas, ropa veijas, pernil with mofongo, and enchiladas with mole negro.
The arepas we ordered we never received.  We got something else in its place. It tasted okay. It was warm not hot.
The ropa veija was tasty it was over plantains. We enjoyed this dish.
The mofongo was tasty and pernil was good. We had ordered this the last time and it was our least fav dish. This time we really enjoyed it.
The chicken enchiladas was cold! Like ice cold! And flavorless. I wouldn't get this..

It's crazy how delicious Clover Clubs food and cocktails are and how mediocre Leyenda food and cocktails are. Unfortunately, I would say this is prob our last visit here. The only thing going is the vibe. It's really a shame..

Parking is somewhat easy(352)

This was the first of 3 stops for the Friday night happy hour tour with the throuple. The decor was very well done for with a Hawaii/Halloween theme decorations and drinks. My favorite part was the fact they had both table and lounge style areas

We had 3 different tequila based drinks - poloma, margarita and a spicy margarita - and all 3 were great. The trick is to have a strong kick of alcohol but with the flavor to not make it taste like burning. They hit it on the nose.

For snacks we git the Chicharon and guac. The chicharon was not what I expected, having a Colombian sister in law and a Filipino girlfriend. It was basically pork rinds. The guac was great however and came with salsa as well.

This place was once amazing. Now it's mediocre at best. The host and wait staff somewhat robotic. They have now went the route of putting some of their signature cocktails on draft! VERY LAZY MOVE. CANT CHARGE $14 for draft cocktails. I would literally commute 1hr just to grab one of their delicious Spicy Palomas now that's on draft. It taste like a cheap flavored soda. RIP Leyenda.

What a great place!! The hubs and I decided to come  here after catching a show at The
Bell  House, it was one of the few eateries open late on a Wednesday, the decor is lovely and authentic without being tacky or overdone. The food was very good, I had the pupusas, and the hubs had the Peruvian Salad, and two negro modelos, which they had on draft !
The guacamole was fresh and flavorful as well.
My only disappointment was how tiny the pupusas were!!
Guess next time I'll get two orders...
The service was superb, attentive, courteous and professional.

Had a great time here! The drinks were delicious and so was the food. Currently celebrating Christmas so there are lots of decorations and Christmas themed drinks. Our bartender was super attentive and always made sure we were doing ok. They do get very crowded the later it gets so be prepared for a crowded bar and dining room. Will definitely be back during the warmer months!

Leyenda was on my bucket list to go to in Bk and it met my expectations.  The croquetas were delicious as was the bacalao and al pastor tacos.  The cocktails were amazing as well. Was happy to see a Bourbon drink included in the rotation.  Great service overall. Would highly recommend.

This is definitely one of my favorite cocktails bars in Brooklyn. The chiller instinct is one of the smoothest bourbon drinks I've ever had & the frozen horchata drink they offer in the summer is like candy.

With that being said, they tend to mix up the drinks by the season, but almost every cocktail that I've tried here, I've enjoyed. Drinks run in the standard range for cocktail bar $13-$15. The vibe is also inviting and warm here.

I would have to dock a star for food, however. They have some small plates, including tacos that were all flavorful, but pale in comparison to the drinks.

I went to have a nice relaxing time with friends after a long week. Immediately as you walk in there is a big sign with a drawing of Trump and above it it says "Donald Trump es un pendejo"...This is right in your face as you walk in. I found it offensive and strange that this restaurant would choose to have this huge and crude political statement greet customers as they walk in. Of course it is their right to do so, and they can do it if they want to, but I think that type of in your face political stuff is annoying, for either side.

5 stars for cocktails
Food is probably overpriced with very small portions, was still hungry after paying $50/pp...
Service was pretty slow but friendly
Otherwise cool atmosphere.
Recommend reserving spot on waitlist on yelp so you can walk in when there's a seat for you

My friends and I went to Leyenda for their Christmas pop op theme two Sundays ago and enjoyed the lunch a lot. They call it "Sleyenda" and it's cute because they decorate and create holiday themed cocktails. I had the Six Geese a Layin and Coconut Horchata Cold Bree with booze and both were good. We had the guacamole and it was quite good and we enjoyed the salsa but when they asked us if we wanted more chips and salsa, we said yes because why wouldn't we?! And then we were charged $2.50 for more salsa and chips. That's a little deceiving and honestly, really not cool in my opinion. The chicken molè enchiladas were very good though, so I can appreciate that. I also mentioned to the server that I would want to finish my meal with the coquito go ho drink and then when I was finished with my meal and went to order it, it was gone. Really? I mean, I get it. If people order something you give it to them but a heads up about the drink being closed to being 86d for the day would have been awesome. Unfortunately, after a beer next door afterwards, we were still hungry so went elsewhere.

Great food but beware masks are required at the table when staff come over. Yes it's a tough time but the host/ waiter was extreme when it came to insisting on us putting our masks on every time he came over. Do not bring a first date here. Very awkward. It was stressful especially facing the wall, hoping I'd be prepared for when he showed up. He left the pitcher of water on the bench near us when we weren't masked up. I'm not ignorant to Covid but this was over the top. So overall good food and good atmosphere but I think it's important to be aware that the mask on mask off requirement is very much enforced.

I feel like I've come to this restaurant through 3 or 4 name (possibly owner) changes and right now it's the best I've ever experienced. The food is simply amazing. I'm very impressed with the quality of ingredients and  how well everything is prepared. Their drink options are also top notch. I went there a little before Christmas, and they nailed the holiday  theme. From the decorations to the spirited cocktails (no pun intended) it was an awesome experience. Will be coming back for sure.

One of my favorite Brooklyn bars, located in Cobble Hill, Leyenda has an extensive cocktail menu ranging from strong spirit forward to fruity tiki drinks!

It can get packed during the weekend nights but it's never uncomfortably crowded inside. They have an extensive variety of mezcal lining the wall behind the bar and great options for a light dinner.

My favorites here:
1) Shotgun Wedding, if you're looking for a strong sweet and creamy drink!
2) Potato, Cheese and Chorizo Flautas, need I say anymore? Good to be shared if you want to get multiple dishes!
3) Fish Tacos, I've had bad fish tacos before and let me just say this is far from bad! So good!

Leyenda, a sister bar to Clover Club, delivers on all fronts. Super down-to-earth bartenders. Great happy hour.

Ambiance is sort of Mexican saloon-like? Sort of worn, chipping wood, big wooden booths, almost picnic table-y. Oh, and there is a backyard.

The Paloma cocktail I had was very balanced and affordable (see happy hour above). I only had a quick drink when waiting for a friend, so I can't say much more. But I wish I could. Next time I'm in the neighborhood, this will be top of mind.

Note: this review is more for the drinks than the food, although I have had the chance to sample some items from the menu.

All in all a cool, higher-end Mexican and tequila spot close to the Bergen stop with an awesome selection of cocktails with unexpected ingredients, a variety of tequila flights, and some pretty unbeatable happy hour deals (M-F, 5-7pm and 11pm-1am).

During happy hour, you can choose between $4 estrellas, $5 wine, $5 micheladas, or some select $8 cocktails. The happy hour cocktails aren't the most exotic, but you get what you pay for. I've gotten the michelada a few times and wasn't blown away - I like mine a lot spicier usually (just because you're a fancy place doesn't mean you can get away without tajin!) but it's still tasty and refreshing. It's made with a papaya and carrot sangrita and adorned with a lime scored with diagonal lines and a metal straw. It's all in the details.

The cocktail menu is super cool - my favorite drink is the Horchata Colada ($13) which is a delicious, and I'm sure extremely caloric, frozen beverage with overproof rum, nutmeg, etc. It's served in the coolest skull mug. I recently tried the Life of Pablo ($13) with poblano-infused mezcal, pineapple rum, manzanilla sherry, dolin blanc, and Suze. While I was unimpressed by the drink itself, the presentation was something straight out of Achatz's The Aviary. The bartender had to run back to the garden to pick the garnish for my drink. The Daiquiri Al Pastor ($14) with pork fat-washed white rum, pineapple, achiote, agave, and lime was a disappointment.

All in all, pretty remarkable cocktail menu + great happy hour deals = I'll absolutely go back. Why just 4 stars, then? The few times that my boyfriend and I have gone and tried to sit out back, the service was just abysmal. There was a time we were seated, waited 45 minutes for someone to come over, and then eventually just gave up. Lesson learned; I just know to sit at the bar where I'm firmly planted in front of the bartenders.

Came here on a Saturday night after seeing that this place was highly rated. Boy did I make a big mistake. My girlfriend and I ordered the panuchos and the tequila flakes shrimp arepa. I was super hungry so I was thinking about ordering more but I'm glad I didn't. When the food came we were shocked to see how small the portion size was. It was literally a two-three bite meal. For over $30 between the two of us that was a bit much. We ended up going to pig beach to get more food since we left unsatisfied. I'm not sure if people come here for the drinks or what not but the food is average and overpriced. Definitely will not come back.

Came here for "Cinco de Derby" as they put it because they're awesome and understand how unfair it is to have to choose between celebrating Cinco de Mayo or Kentucky Derby. Leyenda's all like, why not both?

They had 3 varieties of margarita and 1 julep on their special menu for the night. I stuck to the classic margarita and wow, it was excellent. Actually, maybe even perfect! They used a very fine grain salt to salt the rim which made it that much better. It was so good I had to have a second. I didn't get the chance to try their julep, but that's just my excuse to come back.

On top of amazing drinks, Leyenda has an insane food menu full of Latin American deliciousness: pupusas, flautas, empanadas, enchiladas, etc. All the good stuff. We had the patacones con ropa vieja, which is a fried green plantain topped with shredded beef, crema, and queso fresco. It was my first time trying it and it was to die for! My friend and I were fighting over the last bites.

Can't wait to come back!

A mixologist's dream

The extensive cocktail menu is one of Leyenda's claim to fame. I'm pretty simplistic when it come to my adult beverages (I do not need more than three ingredients in my drinks), but folks who are really in to crafty multi-layered adult beverages will enjoy this spot. Since most of the specialty cocktails have at least 5+ ingredients, it may take some time to receive your drinks if you are in a larger group or if the restaurant is busy. Fortunately for us, we came on a relatively slow night.

For food, I went the papusas. Although they were not mind blowing, as they are in some  places in deep in Queens, they did hit the spot.

The bartenders (um mixologists) are very relatable and chill; I chatted with a couple of them and a manager for a few minutes.

They have great drinks here. The Brooklyn burro was my favorite! It is more of a bar vibe so the plates are smaller. The guacamole is very good, the al pastor and pollo tacos were great as well. My favorite dish was probably the pernil, though. It was so tender and flavorful! I think Leyenda is great for a casual date night.

Participating in an archery class really works up an appetite and boy did I find that out-lol. Before leaving Gotham Archery the other weekend, we felt hunger setting in....Deciding where to go took us several minutes. Kemi whipped out her phone and searched on Yelp for nearby eateries. We called Leyenda and they indicated that there currently was a table for party of 4. We walked there and the hostess seated us upon arrival. Leyenda had great energy with people socializing and having fun! You know that this kind of place has my name written all over it-lol.

Leyenda is a Latin-American establishment that has a bar, cozy style table settings w/ stool type seating and a semi-private lounge area called "The Pews" located in the back where groups can hang out and enjoy themselves. I walked back there to get an idea and it is cozy.

Many patrons seemed to be having cocktails. There was a couple at the bar and they had these beautiful drinks. The bartender politely informed me that they had the Tia Mia Cocktail. Well, I tried one of of course-lol. The Tia Mia has Mezcal espadin, Jamaican Rum, Orange Curcao, Lime and Orgeat. Beautiful presentation and it tasted nice and strong!

We opened our menus and started ordering. Leyenda serves small plates so we tried a variety of items. Rich and creamy Guacamole was delightful w/ the chips. Good Skirt Steak. Flavorful Tinga de Puerco (pulled pork) and Pollo (chicken) Tacos....Such juicy, succulent meat in the tacos! Fantastic!

Leyenda's staff are so warm and welcoming! Thanks!

Glad I finally got to try this place out. I had wanted to check it out when it was Sleyenda for the Xmas season but never got around to it. This place is the epitome of what I thought a NYC restaurant/bar would look like before moving here. Dimly lit, great music, brick wall accents, laid back crowd. Their drink menu has some really interesting concoctions. I had a margarita and the trade winds - both of which were delicious. To start we got the chips and guac which were delicious and the guac was amazing and smooth - served right in the avocado shell. For my meal I got the skirt steak which was one of the most juicy, tender and flavorful skirt steaks Ive ever had. It literally melted in my mouth like butter and was cooked perfectly medium rare. My only complaint was that it was kind of small and came with no side. The service was great - from the host to our waitress. 4 stars for the kind of small pricey drinks and small food portions...I left still hungry lol but I will definitely be back!

Came here for dinner last night and it was fantastic - the service here is impeccable, they're all very attentive and took our orders down quickly. I highly recommend La Sonambula if you love a spicy cocktail, it was the perfect amount of spice, sweetness and sourness in a drink. The skirt steak here i'd phenomenal, it's often hard to find a place that will cook skirt steak medium perfectly but they nailed it. I will definitely be coming back.

Stopped by last month for "Sleyenda" which was touted as a Beyonce themed pop up for the holidays. Besides the menu card which had a picture of Santa that said "I sleigh" there wasn't one nod to the Queen Bey in the place...not even a Destiny's Child song from the Christmas album included in the soundtrack. Perhaps the theme was over hyped online, but I felt a bit fooled by the advertising.

Regardless of the deceptive theme, I'd give three stars for the overall experience. It's a great little spot tucked away on a busy street. While some of the spots in the areas have lines for days to squeeze into brunch, there are plenty of tables and room to move around inside.

The cocktails are great. I had one of the holiday specials. You can tell there was time and effort put into creating these drinks and it pays off. The food on the other hand is just average. The guacamole and chips are quiet nice and the guac is served in the avocado - it's on the small side so order a couple if you're sharing with a big table. I also had the mole enchiladas in which the ingredients seemed rather simple.

My recommendation would be to go for the cocktails. If you want order food, then grab a few plates and share as they're on the small side.

Chic joint offering mexican/central american inspired cuisine and some serious cocktails. Walked in here around 8pm on a sunday evening and were able to get a seat in the cute little back patio without having to wait. Not much in way of a view but it was nice to sit outdoors. They also have a couple of seats at the windows facing Smith St along with the regular inside seating.

Started off with a couple of cocktails since that seems to be one of the USPs of Leyenda. Got the Grass Roots Persuasion and another one served in a skull shaped container, the name of which I cannot recall. Both were well presented and tasted phenomenal. They run a little pricey but are solid for the $. For food decided to get the house made guac, fava bean empanadas and the pupusas. Guac was great, served in an avocado skin and came with fresh chips and salsa. The empanadas were delicious as were the pupusas. Full marks for presentation on everything - drinks and food. They really do put effort into it which reflects in the dining experience. My only quip was that the portion sizes were rather small although we did only order what would traditionally be considered appetizers. A few more vegetarian items on the entrées would have been great. Service was on the slower side but friendly regardless. Will be back again for their cocktails and to check out their brunch.

Came in late yesterday afternoon with a baby stroller , the host was very accommodating and sat as at a lovely corner table on the back patio.   Our server was very friendly and efficient , I ordered a house margarita and chips & guac , while our server recommended the empanadas.   Everything was fantastic , can't wait to come back and try more.   Good job Leyenda !!

Drinks were awful and served in kitchy plastic cups that were maybe not even food-grade plastic. Service very extremely slow and then it was smarmy/hipster. Food was catastrophically bad. Cool igloo in the back yard.

Fun place! I came here for drinks and they have a decent happy hour with good options. The food is a little on the pricy side but the food is good so worth it. I like the look of the place- has a rustic Mexican feel and the service is good. I had the hora drink- refreshing, with a kick of spice. Is a little more of a summer drink I would say cos of the fruitiness.
Come here for a date, it is on the quieter side unless it fills up so is good for conversation.

The most important thing about this place is it offers small plates. I'm not a big eater so I like the small portions.

I was here with my son and husband they're bigger eaters then I so we ordered six small plates what a variety!

I imagine this is a great after work stop as it offered  happy hour prices which were a bit pricier  then what I am used to coming from a small town but that's the way it is when the country mouse goes' to the big city!
