Great place, delicious sandwiches and tasty coffee. They are doing great with COVID measures and everyone was polite and helpful. Definitely recommended.

A true Parisian vibe that's hard to find in the city and a total oasis in the middle of the financial district. Definitely come here for Brunch. It's so good. You won't regret it!!!!!!! Support them during Covid!

DELICIOUS breakfast, may look small in the photo but it was hearty and flavor packed!!  The bun was warm and had a crunch on the outside then so soft on the inside, and Perfect perfect salmon and avocado (and a LOT of them both) - no skimping!! Coffee was great as well.  Very cute spot & is doing great COVID wise with the few distanced tables and contactless experience (ordering, not reusing menus, paying, etc) .  Will def be coming back often!!  Also fun calm French music playing in the background :)

In the year 2020, going for a regular dental cleaning was considered risky business. I decided that since I was already outside, I would treat myself to some brunch after the cleaning. I'd walked by La Parisienne many times but this would be my first visit.

There was sidewalk seating plus 4 tables inside. The front door was left open so there was air circulation. As all the outdoor tables were full, I ate inside for the first time since March. I felt I had more social distance space indoors than out and I faced the open door so it felt relatively ok. They checked my temperature and had me fill out the contact tracing form. The utensil set was in a paper sleeve.

The cappuccino was made with skim milk (yay!!) and when grabbing some sugar, I noticed each table had hand sanitizer. I was surprised the egg in the croque madam wasn't nested in the bread but didn't stop me from enjoying a runny yolk. The side salad helped cut some of the oiliness.

The Yelp 10% off for checking in did work but I felt bad for using a coupon so I got a cookie to go as well. Overall the food is fine, the atmosphere was nice, and the CV19 safety checks were great.

UPDATE: I appreciate the business owners prompt response below, as well as the necessary actions they took to remedy the poor experience my friend I had at the establishment. I've updated my review to 3stars, and will update it again if we ever find ourselves giving the establishment another shot.

I came here with a friend due to the good reviews, but was so disappointed. First off, we called in advance to place an order for pickup, we were catching a ferry and in a bit of a rush. The person on the phone told us 10 minutes. We showed up in 15, and from what it appeared they only started making our food when we arrived. The place wasn't even busy, we were the only ones waiting!!! I ordered the croque madame (paid extra for avocado) and my friend got the avo toast. I also got a dirty chai latte. We tipped when we arrived ($6) so the total was just over 40.  At first I was handed an iced dirty chai (not quite what I ordered) but I shrugged it off and didn't think much of it. To make a long story short, we didn't get our food for another 20 or so minutes, missed our ferry and had to pay for an Uber, AND after all that they forgot the avocado on my croque madame (that was extra). So I overpaid, wasn't given what I ordered.

La Parisienne is a cozy gem in the neighborhood. Slightly off the tourist path where locals will meet for an unhurried and delicious sliver of Paris in the Financial District.

I think we've enjoyed just about every selection on the menu and have never been disappointed. The coffee is excellent and the wines delightful, the prices are reasonable. The service is always friendly, if you speak French you'll be right at home.

My number of check-ins doesn't come close to reflecting that we've been coming to La Parisienne for a few years now; breakfast, brunch, lunch, coffee, snacks.

There are only a few tables so some times there will be a wait, they do have a brisk take-out service and outdoor seating in season.

Glad they had indoor seating, temp checks and hand sanitizers on the table. While they were welcoming, the portions are so small for the prices! I added avocado to my brioche smoked salmon sandwich. For an extra $3 for an avocado addition.. I expected MORE than 3 small slices!! My sandwich contained small pieces of salmon, they were very cheap with the ricotta spread on the bun too. Coffee wasn't bad.

When I went I really got interested in a mushroom sandwich and it was a great decision, the really good flavors of the mushroom with the french cheese were great and the side dish salad was very fresh. Also, a great place to have a cup of coffee

Bookmarked this place when I went to Financial District with my father. Did not regret it. Small cozy French restaurant/cafe packed to the brim, and for good reasons!

La Parisienne was a very good experience, I ordered the crab cake sandwich with avocado on brioche and it great. Honestly, the highlight for me was the bun, it was fluffy and had a nice crunch! The bread makes or breaks a sandwich for me.

The menu is a little bit lighter than I would've thought, but I had 0 real complaints about this place so it gets my five! Check out the yelp check-in deal here as well.

Placed an order through Ritual for Tuesday afternoon lunch at this cozy cafe. Relatively small inside for a popular eatery, as I had to squeeze through all the busy tables to get to the pickup area in the back.

My order consisted of the Chicken Salad Brioche Sandwich ($13) as well a Turmeric Latte ($4.75). The sandwich has a seasoned chicken spread and veggies inside a toasted brioche bun. Bread tasted a bit stale, saved a little bit by the tangy-ness of the chicken salad. Turmeric latte lacked much flavor and had a grainy texture. Probably better off using whole milk rather than skim in the future.

Seems like this place is popular and the menu in extensive enough to try other items for lunch or dinner on a return trip.

The wait was very quick, outdoor seating, friendly and quick service. The food was also delicious, we got the avocado toast, French toast and the mushroom egg sandwich. The French toast was great, not too sweet and not too dry. The avo toast was alright, a bit dry.

Business Owner

9/4/2020Dear Laura,

Thank you for your review. We are sorry to hear (see) what happened.
This is not the way the chocolate croissant is suppose to be, something must have been done wrong during the preparation.

Our pastries are really great quality, specially the pain au chocolat, i do think it tastes even better than in France.

Again, we are really sorry about the quality that you received. Please don’t hesitate to stop by and try again, you won’t be disappointed.

We hope you will give us an other chance and maybe change the rating from 2 stars to 5 stars.

Thank you for your support.

What a cozy yet  stylish little french bakery! The decors on the walls and through out the store put one on a happy mood immediately.

We were here for afternoon coffee and snack, ended up trying the warm apple tart and the pairs-brest. The apple tart was a pleasant surprise, thin piece but was condensed with layers of apple and yumminess. Paris - brest was a bit hard on the bread, and a little cold compared to expectation, but the cream filling was still tasty.

Our server lady was very friendly and tentative. Overall grear experience.

This place is popping so you might have a bit of a wait, especially if you go on a Saturday like I did (note: definitely make use of the Yelp waitlist function), but believe me when I say it's worth it.

Like any other proper millennial, I'm a fan of avocado toast. The avocado toast here is among the best I've had in a restaurant. They happened to be out of multigrain bread, so they offered to substitute the bread with sweet potatoes. Good thing they were out of the bread because that combination, with the addition of the smoked salmon, was phenomenal. I don't usually find avocado toast particularly filling, but at La Parisienne it was a healthy, satisfying meal. I also tried a piece of my friend's croque madame, which was nothing but buttery goodness. To finish things off, I picked up a sticky bun at the pastry bar that I ate later that evening. Spoiler: it was delicious.

The best thing about La Parisienne is that the prices are more than reasonable (and a Yelp check-in gets you 10% off). And the service was fast and friendly---my water glass was never empty. The next time I visit NYC, I will definitely pay La Parisienne another visit if I happen to be in the neighborhood.

Had breakfast here this morning and I loved every single minute of my time here. Was visiting NYC and traveling alone so it was easy to get in quickly and sit a the bar. The baristo / bartender helped me with my selection as I was uncertain whether to get the avo toast or the salmon brioche. He made the best recommendation ever and suggested the avo toast with salmon on top! Mind BLOWN!

Also ordered the chia pudding which included coconut toppings and fresh fruit. Spectacularly perfect in every way.

Black coffee  to top things off made my last breakfast in NYC delightfully perfect. I cannot recommend this place enough and I can't wait to bring my family and friends here. Not a great place for big groups as this is a tiny venue. Great for one or two people, if you come during peak times you will find a line!

Check in on yelp and you could also get a 10% discount off the bill! Merci!

This is the review I did a year ago and just realized it never got posted!
My boyfriend and I wanted to find something special for our weekend brunch place. We found this one! Music is pleasant, the space is small but cozy, we sat at the bar, feels like having brunch at friend's home. We ordered the croquet sandwich, little did we know, it's not vegetarian, but we are both vegetarian. I told the hostess that we need to order something else, as it's not vegetarian, they took the sandwich away without giving us hard time or charging! Great experience.

So cute in here. I sat by the chef and the majority of the staff spoke French here. Wait time was short because I look at Yelp before I got there and saw that you can wait on a waiting list. By the time I found a parking spot and got there I got seated quickly. The line was out the door and I can understand why because the food was delicious. Staff was friendly.
I ordered the croissant with ham and cheese, also added avocado and egg to it. That was delicious. I'd live to come back here with my family and friends.

Open at 8:30am, when I came here is 9am and I waited for a while. Decoration is beautiful and cute!!
The chai latte is pretty good, the salmon is a little salty but overall is delicious. The chia pudding is the best!! Mixed with strawberry, pineapple and honey, not so sweet but suitable as a dessert or also appetizer for breakfast!

Cozy cafe! We had a charming server, spoke fluent French with my lunch buddy. I thought while in a French place I should try French Toast. So I can tell the difference between the real thing and the American version. I've already forgotten how to say French Toast in French, but the server said the literal translation was "lost bread", and told me a little story about how it came to be. I loves these kind of connections with the unique eateries in busy cities! Thank for the hospitality,  service, and like I said, that was the best lost bread I ever had!!!

Great breakfast place in New York, I ordered French toast and turmeric latte, both were excellent. The service was great and the place is small and busy.

Came back second day, ordered matcha latte and salmon brioche, again both were very well made, taste great and 5 stars for second round!

I don't often eat lunch in the Financial District, but one bite at this charming French restaurant  secured many return visits to the neighborhood.

An eatery so cramped, errant juice from a lemon a woman squeezed at the next table over squirted right in my eye. That's *howclose* we sat. But, I'd take that acidic unpleasantness any day if it meant I'd be eating a La Parisienne again.

The restaurant offers a weekday combo -- $12.75 for a bowl of soup, salad, & half a croque monsieur -- which I would've ordered had the soup not been cauliflower.

My Croque Forestier ($12) had mushrooms, brie, & truffle bechamel which I topped with two over-hard eggs ($2 each.) The bread was heavily buttered making each bite deliciously decadent. Yup, still thinking about that sandwich...

My friend and I stopped at this location after passing by it multiple times and always seeing it busy. The staff made sure to follow safety procedures by taking our temperatures at the door and seating us at a table that was very much socially distanced. We ordered quite possibly the BEST hot apple cider I've ever tasted. I had the soup of the day (amazing and dairy free), alongside the Croque Forestier (Brie, mushrooms, truffle). I will be dreaming about this meal until I am able to enjoy it again. The energy in the space was light, airy, and vibey. The owner made sure to introduce himself and thank us for the support! 10/10 I cannot recommend enough - you will see us again soon!

What a cute little spot! My friends and I ended up here because we could join the waitlist for brunch online- hard thing to find in such a big city. After checking out of our Airbnb and ditching our luggage we made it to this place. It is tiny but very cutely decorated. The fresh air breeze was a nice touch as well!

Our wait was a few minutes beyond what was estimated from joining the waitlist. They were able to accommodate our large-ish (5) party for the size of the place. The menu was full of delicious sounding options. It was hard to narrow down to one thing.

I opted for the avocado toast and added an egg to get lighter fare after a weekend of gluttonous eating. The toast had a generous spread of miso hummus that was an unusual and incredibly tasty bite. The sesame seeds sprinkled on top added to the overall unique flavor. Great little spot!

WOW I finally found a hidden gem in the heart of FiDi! I was craving some brunch style food on a Sunday morning, but didn't want your typical eggs and waffles.

I can't believe I always walked by this place. The atmosphere is amazing and feels like you just got transported into a little chic cafe in Paris. The space is a little small, so it definitely gets crowded during peak hours, but you can use Yelp's live wait!

The food was PHENOMENAL. I ordered the Sandwich Matin and Brioche French Toast. First, the Sandwich Matin was delicious and the prosciutto was very fresh. The brioche buns they used were so good! It was also toasted to perfection.

Next, the Brioche French Toast was so crazy good. I really think the Brioche buns make a HUGE difference. It tasted amazing when it was drizzled with maple syrup and topped with almonds, blueberries, and bananas!

I'll be back soon for my next weekend brunch!!

I don't usually frequent FiDi but while in the neighborhood, we decided to come here for a quick brunch. Glad we did. The food is so delicious and French. The atmosphere is iconic Parisienne including contemporary French music and decor. Well priced for the portion and quality. Would come here again. Use the 10% off for checking in ;)

We had the French toast this morning. It was utterly fantastic! The main gentleman there who was a host/server was also great, too.

The espresso is good, too.

I very highly recommend this place. Definitely check it out.

Had a lovely dining experience in this adorable cafe in downtown Manhattan. Stopped in this place for a quick bite prior to checking out the 9/11 Memorial and had a delightful meal. I went with the organic quinoa salad with smoked salmon served over a bed of spinach with shaved radishes with black sesame seeds (generous portion and refreshing with Asian flavor twist!) as well as the salmon brioche (fluffy warm bread with smoked salmon with a delightful herbs cream cheese, cucumber and dill (satisfying and filling). Our waitress had a French accent (love that touch, feels like I was dining out in Paris)! Highly recommend this place.

Love this place. Whilst I can't travel to Paris this is the closest I can get to Parisienne food.  Service is impeccable and the decoration is phenomenal
Glad they stayed open during the lockdown

I really like this little place and everything tastes pretty good here. The only problem I noticed is consistency in food taste. You can definitely tell the difference when you come during their busy hours from when not. Although they look the same, something is off when they are busy. It's not that exciting to have something different from what you expected after a long wait. If you want to try their great sandwiches, I recommend visiting them early.

Lovely hidden gem cafe and small restaurant in lower Manhattan! This one window cute place make you feel a bit in Europe or definitely not close to Wall Street. Decor and menu are clearly French style.

I went over for an early dinner/bite and I enjoyed happy hour rose at half price a glass, and a delicious salad with warm goat cheese, prosciutto, arugula, and sundries tomatoes.

The menu is fairly reach considering the small place. I can't wait to go back trying other small dishes, or eggs in various styles.

Cute little shop - a perfect place for breakfast or lunch! My sister and I shared the warm green bowl and ham and cheese croissant and would totally order the same combo again! The salad was very filling and freshly made and the croissant sandwich was super flavorful and rich. The rose sangria was also light and refreshing with some fresh berries! Service was friendly and efficient! Open during COVID with at least small 5 tables set up outside.

This place is so adorable, is this what Paris is like? I've always liked pastries but the delicacies are superb.  I had to make a stop before my tour at the federal reserve bank.  It was a delight to have a treat before an amazing tour!

Thank you for your accommodation.  I hope to be back in the near future.  Hope all is well with the COVID situation.
