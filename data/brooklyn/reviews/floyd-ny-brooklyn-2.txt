I'm basically just rating this place as a reaction to all of the crylords rating 1 star and telling their nonsensical life story.

It's a divey bar with cheap drinks, bocce ball, and nice staff. decide for yourself if that's what you want or not. Floyd delivers on everything it tries to be.

Floyd is one of those local watering holes that should suit anyone's fancy just looking to enjoy a cold beer or other spirits after a long day or just catching up with friends or co-workers. Floyd is definitely not fancy, in fact, it really gives you an olden days western tavern feel. The bartender that served me was friendly and welcoming.

For those that enjoy live music and games (Bocce), Floyd has visiting live bands and other musical performances. Floyd also has games that you can play with friends while you're enjoying your cocktail, beer or beverage. Again, Floyd is a neighborhood bar the definitely caters to the locals and music lovers. It's ways great to support local bars and restaurants and Floyd is definitely worthy of the support.

Definitely my fave bar in cobble hill for late night beers! The vibes are always on point and the bartenders, including Tom, are always super sweet and attentive.

So went to DUMBO to check out the Timeout Food court....yeah I hated it, so I walked away far and fast enjoying the water but also pouring out sweat like only an old bald guy in the sun can...I needed a beer! So I hooked inland grabbed yelp and found Floyd...an oasis on Atlantic ave.

Let's see friendly bartender, ice cold AC and nice selection of beer, indoor bocce(yeah my ex wife is italian so hate bocce) but plenty of nice couches and hardly any annoying young people...ok 3, the other youngins were quiet and well mannered. So yeah I love this place, so please don't screw it up and raise the rent and turn it into a TD Bank.

Floyd is a chill, relaxing bar. very spacious and tons of comfortable seating.

prices are inexpensive and there's something for everyone here: whether you like whiskey, craft beer, or you're not afraid to slum it with cheap whiskey/beer shot combos (that's all three for yours truly, thankyouverymuch).

and, for hydration, there's a big cooler in the center of the room, so you don't have to bug the bartender for water as frequently (such is the joy of being a long-distance runner).

there's also an indoors bocce court!

admittedly, I couldn't help but notice that the one bartender looked an awful lot like my uncle, which only made the place better.

After taking a long walk through the neighborhood, we found Floyd. This was truly a gift because all the other places to drink on a Saturday were a little too... well not our speed. Either a little too fancy or an older crowd. We were looking for comfortable leaning on dive and we found it in Floyd. Pulled up a stool and ordered some Red Stripe for the bartender who was super nice, forgot her name, and enjoyed a couple of hours. It really seemed to be a neighborhood spot and there were a lot of regulars (which is a quality I look for in a bar). It's a really nice space with baci ball too. It's a spot that the neighborhood needs, for sure and I'll be back.

I invited a lot of friends here for a going away on Saturday. The Bar tender (I'm kicking myself for not remembering her name) was just the best. It was just her tending to a Saturday crowd plus our big group for the first couple of hours and she was just so cool about it all. Great place to hang with a group of friends or to pop in and chat with the staff behind the bar. A neighborhood spot we will miss. Thanks!

Had a great time...other than trying to play bocce. A group of apparent "league" players decided they wanted to control the court...but not by skill. They just kept skipping over names on the list and lying about it. The first time was when my friend's name was bypassed. Realized definitively when I asked some guys reviewing the list who was up next.  Turns out I was supposedly on the court currently playing despite standing on the sidelines. Never made it on to the court.

Don't even think about accidentally bringing a baby to Floyd. You will be reminded of how arbitrary discrimination works. You will be told to leave, and the bartender will place a "no children allowed" sign on the door.

It's interesting to see that all humans aren't treated equally at Floyd. Perhaps it's a symptom of Trump's America.

Better luck next time, i.e. never again.

+1 point for the Madmen trailer being parked out front, a celeb sighting, and someone confusing me for a director.

+1 point for an indoor bocce court that's free and easy to use.

Also, great acoustics for conversation.

No glitz, no glam, but I appreciated the simplicity of this bar.

After braving through the chaos of 5th avenue the day after Christmas, it was nice to find some peace, tranquility and DRINKS.

The tap beer and wine selection aren't extensive, but you'll definitely enjoy the few craft beers on tap and the generous wine pours from the bartender.

Prices were reasonable. For my glass of Malbec and my boyfriend's IPA, our bill was $14. Plus, the bartender was extremely nice and attentive.

If you want a quiet evening with friends, I'd highly recommend Floyd!

HAHA I LOVE THIS SPOT!

I am NOT a hipster but I love the vibe that this place has. Its has mellow music which allows you to to hear who you are talking to, thats always a plus.

The bar tender is pretty cool, and although there is no kitchen they allow you to go out and get food and eat in inside the bar. What makes it even better is that there are couches here.

Now heres the best part- IT HAS A BOCCHE BALL COURT IN THE BACK!!! I learned how to play and now all I want to do is go back there.

I think the place is a bit overrated from what I was hoping for coming in. First time on a Saturday afternoon into evening. First thing I saw before coming was they had bocce, but in reality it's more like bocce meets bowling because you roll the ball because the court is just wood.

I feel bad, but there was literally only 1 woman working the entire place. She was so overworked, and had no help. As a result, the service time was really bad. She had a crowded bar, but could barely keep up with demand, and as a result, there was no one to go around cleaning up besides her on the off chance she had a second to breath.

Drinks were fine, nothing to write home about. Reasonably priced. I came in from Manhattan so I probably won't make the trip back out. We found a good spot for dinner down the block easily enough so that was fine.

This place is decent bar but the dark haired female bartender (manager?) could not be any less friendly.  Acts as if she's angry to be there, and annoyed to be helping you.  And if you bring a toddler in there prepare for the stink eye.  This bar is in cobble hill.  Not asking you to have a kids menu but for the love of god don't make people feel guilty about having a child (provided he or she is well behaved).

Ample seating and standing room? Check.
Activities for bros or those who have a competitive spirit? Check.
A great beer selection? No, and at the end of the day, the drink selection is determinative of how good a bar is.
Floyd is your average neighborhood bar that offers a laid-back time for locals (or the occasional student crowd). However, it just doesn't warrant a visit if you reside in another neighborhood.

My friend mentioned going to a birthday Friday night of someone I possibly met once years upon years ago. Of course I sprung for the opportunity to catch up and check out some places in Cobble Hill. Floyd's I vaguely remember hanging out in briefly possibly 4 or 5 years ago with a friend that had just moved from Michigan. I remember being annoyed at how crowded it was with her friends and walked out before purchasing a drink. This time it wasn't that bad. The people throwing the celebration had the back of the bar reserved. Also, the front of the bar wasn't too bad because we managed to get seats at the bar.

Drinks during non-happy hour: Everything is pretty much $6. Wells and beer. My friend wasn't sure what she wanted so I suggested a lighter wheat beer and actually went with the Allagash as well. Unfortunately, she realized that she didn't like her beer after two sips or most beers and strongly encouraged me out of fascination to chug mine and chug hers so she can order 2 more drinks and close out her tab. This is where Ingrid makes life mistakes. I'm fully capable of chugging a beer faster than most men. Head hits the table. We discussed what she would possibly like next because we doubted they would serve white Russians (her drink of choice) and I recommended trying a Tequila Sunrise. The bartender was trying but she made it with pineapple juice. That is a Florida Sunrise, folks. My knowing this is probably not a great thing. Very boozy and delicious but not the right mix.

I like the décor of the place. It's apparently Union Hall's twin sister bar. We don't like when bars have twin sisters because it just takes away from its originality. But they ALSO have bocce ball and beer cheese here with antiquated furniture and couches. Union Hall's library is admittedly cooler but I like that it is not as much of a mad house on a weekend night. Also, they played a lot of old school Arcade Fire which went appreciated.

Ms. Pac Man, which I am terrible at and played at least two rounds of, is in the corner. We also came across a party crasher named Megan that night. She was a hoot and a half. I love party crashers that offer you free gum and take pictures with you in party hats and cake. Cake cake cake cake cake cake. Cake. Party time.

I've been to Floyd twice now and while this bar will never be my cup of tea, I can understand why people like it.

It's a fun, casual sports bar reminiscent of your favorite college spot (great for groups, mixed drinks in plastic cups, etc.) Thats all great... if that's your thing. But if you're like me and prefer more upscale, intimate bars with a solid wine selection, Floyd may not be your favorite.

Bocce what? The last thing one expects to see when walking into a bar is a clay court, designed to play a game that old Italian guys have loved since time immemorial. But hey, its Brooklyn right?

Turns out that bocce ball is pretty much the best. Was it because I am uber competitive? Maybe. Or maybe it was the fact that you can get a decently priced beer while you're rolling bocce. Either way, this is the main draw to Floyds, along with the unpretentious vibe. Walking in, the first thing that struck me (beyond the obvious court) was how dark the back was. But it kind of worked for the place, especially for the arena (like I said, I'm competitive). There's old wooden furniture and old couches that look like they came right out of the 70's, along with an old Packman machine in the back to round out the flavor.  We ordered up a round of cheap beers (it was happy hour) and got to work playing bocce. Not a terribly hard game to learn, we were quickly joined by some others who wanted in. I think this is the beauty of a place like Floyds; it forces human interaction, which is cool. I guess.... Once in a while. The staff is super chill, they didn't even freak when I hit a low celling beam with a ball, making quite the noise (turns out trying to "jump" another ball is a bad move...don't try this*). We played a few rounds, and were eventually dethroned in an exceptionally close match (pains me still); needless to say I got really (really) into this game, but I'm betting you would too, so why not give it a shot.

This place is absolutely worth checking out; I'll certainly be back for another round of bocce and a bucket of beers sooner than later.

Very cool spot for pre-dinner drinks. Came here on a Saturday before going to see a movie. The couches were cool, and of course, being able to show my out-of-town friends a bar with bocce ball was a plus.

Bartender wasn't the friendliest dude, but he got us our drink orders quickly and without any problems.

By the time we left, it had started to get a little more crowded with annoying volleyball players. I had heard that Floyd is pretty hit-or-miss at night, and I could see that. On the flip side, some girl at the bar gave me a tequila shot because she ordered too many. So there's that.

Generally friendly faces behind the counter with room to hang out and bar games to play. Fair prices and it's the best bar in it's immediate area. I come here once a week and I've never had a bad time, great for the Brooklyn heights area without having to travel too far down Atlantic or to smith street. I'll be back again for a cold pint, cheers mates!

Sizable spot with great drinks at reasonable prices, friendly staff and bocce!  They used to allow dogs, which I loved, but I heard they no longer do.  I like that although they do not offer food, they gladly offer menus for places in the area that deliver and let you eat at the bar, on one of their comfortable couches, etc.  I'm always down for going to Floyd!

I used to love coming to this place but after last night, I don't think I'll be drinking there again. This bar pours cheap well liquor into expensive bottles. I used to bartend and I know a lot of places do this but this one got caught. It's inexcusable especially when you're someone with an allergy or sensitivity to certain ingredients that are in one vodka but not in another. Liars and cheats.
Detailed explanation below...

My girlfriend and I were there celebrating a friend's birthday. We each had TWO drinks (and I didn't even finish my second). They were Tito's with soda and lime, what we always drink. Most other vodka causes me to have a deadly hangover headache, even if I only had one drink and barely got tipsy...so I stick to Titos. Both of us have this issue with vodka and other liquors so we stick to what we know we can enjoy. Well, this morning we both woke up with the worst hangover headache we've had in years. And we both recalled immediately that this was how we felt when we used to drink other liquors that contained ingredients we don't agree with. So angry. And also sick :/

Floyd looks like a typical Brooklyn hipster dive but I like the comfortable, laid-back atmosphere permeating the place. Plus, I've never seen a bocce ball court inside a bar before so that ups the cool factor. The rummage sale couches and mismatched furniture somehow all work, maybe because they're arranged in little living room style seating areas conducive to conversation. We ended up chatting with fellow customers we didn't know...all because they invaded, oops, asked to sit our living room! My eagle-eyes even found a partially hidden outlet in a fireplace to recharge my perpetually battery-drained iPhone.

The bar isn't the type that serves the trendy mixologist cocktails, but they do have all the top shelf you'd probably want, plus a full line of Brooklyn beer. Floyd is probably hopping on weekend nights, but it's a nice place to relax and unwind on a Sunday afternoon too.

Great place to just wander into on our trip to NYC and first timers in Brooklyn. Cool, casual...somewhat divey (i.e. more divey than not) atmosphere. Long old wood bar with plenty of bar stools. A bunch of couches clustered around, including a nice spot near the front picture window. With the light shining in, plus Rolling Stones music...I could have stayed here all afternoon. Friendly bartender. Good beer selection. Tasty Bloody Mary (Old Bay Seasoning is the secret...shh!) And fun to see the indoor Bocce Ball court. I could easily see being a regular here on a Saturday afternoon.

I have to disclose that this review is a bit biased because this place holds a special place in my heart - I met my husband here 6 years ago so it will always be my favorite neighborhood bar.

That being said, I do think floyd's has a great atmosphere. I've been going here for many years, first as a law student and then with coworkers or friends when I moved to the neighborhood.

The bocce court is obviously a big draw and a lot of fun but they also have a good jukebox, a couple arcade games, and several seating areas to catch up with friends or get to know a date.  The drink prices are decent and the staff is not pretentious.  They also pull out a projector screen for certain sports games if that's your thing.  Lastly, they let you order food to the bar since they don't have a kitchen.  Floyd's has something for everyone!

floyd is a great place to stop in for a drink or two, or stay for a while since it features a full-length bocce court. the side tables were a little more crowded and walking around is narrow, but this is very justified given how the overall space is used for its primary purpose.

My friend and I checked this place out on a Sunday night. We both enjoyed the vibe here it was laid back and very casual. The music was enjoyable and the drinks decently priced. He ordered a rum and coke and I ordered a vodka tonic ($8 each) and we didn't have any complaints. There is nothing extravagant about Floyd's, but that is what I liked about it. If you are just looking for a cool place to hang with friends this is the place to go. I will continue to come here again.

Indoor Bocce, anyone?

yes, there's an indoor Bocce court.  I was in awe.

The vibe is cool, very Brooklyn laid-back neighborhood place.  It is dark towards the back though so we took a seat near the front.  Let there be light!!!!

The happy hour runs from 5-7 and it's a $1 off drafts which are usually $6 and $5 house wine and/or cocktails.  A good price in my mind.

Anyway, I'd stop in again if in the area but otherwise it was a decent bar like many others in NYC.  The beer selection is kind of small which is always a negative in my mind.

I have been here 3 times now and every time it has been good.  This time we had a large group, but scored a table in the back and ordered the bucket of crappy beer all day.  People on the bocce court were all polite about who's turn it was and not being jerks and the music was solid all day.  It's a fun dive, you just have to go in knowing that it is what it is and just kick back and have fun.

The thing I love about most Brooklyn bars is that they're usually pretty big, not too crowded, and have baci ball in the back and this bar was no exception. The only thing I didn't like was the gross couches. The couches in this place all look like they were found in some alley after a long rainstorm; everything was rotted and duct taped and crusty and ripped. The couch we sat on looked like it was covered in a coat of crusty rust; felt gross looking at it and I hoped it was at least comfortable to sit on but the crusty crunch as I sat down gave me shivers.

The rest of the bar is pretty nice, and it was cool that water was served literally from a water cooler in the middle of the bar, I'm
Assuming to encourage "water cooler talk". Decent bar, nothing special, but not good for sitting

Have stopped by here a few times with co-workers and once with friends. The bartenders are very responsive and pretty chill. It's dimly lit and they offer bocce ball in the back which is pretty cool.

There isn't anything special about this place but it's not a terrible place to start or end your night. The prices on the beer and liquor is moderately priced and there's plenty of seating (even on weekends). Always have had a good time when stopping by!

I love how no matter how lively Floyd seems to be, the only thing I have to wait for is bocce.

With good prices, friendly bartenders, and plenty of seating (thanks to what looks like the Meeker Ave Flea's entire living room collection), Floyd is just a comfortable, laid-back place to hang out. It effortlessly entertains both the slightly older, lower-key BK Heights folks, and also the younger, louder crowd from the south side of Atlantic; anyone can relax and have a good time here.

Floyd also holds a place in my heart as the spot where I started to go a little Linsane.* Especially since there was someone next to me, drunk enough to forget how sayings go, shouting "Look at these apples!!" in a Laker fan's face.

*Recent events have me feeling more Lindifferent, sadly.

Very cool place. Comfy vintage sofas like a nice coffee shop. The indoor bocce court alone is worth 4 stars but when you throw in a Pac Man machine and a place to get fried Twinkies next door (Chip Shop) you've got yourself a pretty cool place. The beers are a little pricer than I'd ideally like them if you're not getting their crappy canned beer ($3). Bottles (even Bud Light) are $5, and drafts are $6.

Word of the wise, if you want to play Bocce get there early or sign up on the waiting list and expect to wait awhile (if you're coming on a Friday/Saturday night) because its a hit with the crowd. They used to be a very dog friendly bar, and still might be but now that they sell their own beer cheese ($7) I'm not sure if they're still allowed to be.

A dart board, patio area, or cheaper beers might have been the only way to squeeze the 5th star from me, otherwise a nice place to throw a couple down.

After being sadly surprised that Henry Public only accepts cash, we meandered our around Brooklyn Heights a bit while researching Yelp, of course! Then along came Floyd - a reasonably priced, laid back Brooklyn bar. Oh, and yeah, they have a bocce ball in the middle of the bar, too!

It seems everywhere you go in the Big Apple there is a 2 hour wait, but Floyd had two seats with our name on it. Along with some friendly and fast service, no less! The bar boasts a remarkable design without the way too obvious 'hipster' style. The furniture reminds me of a crafty and cute estate sale effortlessly embellished with old books and candlesticks. Definitely an old professor's study. All I needed was a pipe and and and some hounds tooth attire.
