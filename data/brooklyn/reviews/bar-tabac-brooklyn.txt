Love this place, they did a very good job during the Covid19, it was not easy to give some life to Smith street and they did.
Thank you guys

I had a great experience! The food was good- I ate the snails and mussels. Farra, our waitress, was really kind and took good care of us and even proposed some hand sanitizer at the end of our dinner.
Too bad we couldn't have wine as their license is suspended temporarily.
I will definitely come back !

Anyone who knows food and likes food shouldn't eat here. The atmosphere is good, but the food is worse than a bad diner.

Poached eggs were over done for everyone at the table and the hollandaise tasted so off and oily.
Never again

Bar Tabac is doing their best to stay in business which is a huge challenge since all of their table service is now outside their restaurant. The restaurant is only open if you need to use their bathrooms. It's a little eerie walking inside their darkened dinning and bar area but their bathrooms were clean and they had plenty of soap as well as disinfectants both inside and outside their restaurant.  The service was excellent. Their waiters were respectful and kept their distance. They also were very generous by encouraging us to sit and schmooze long after we had finished eating our lunch.  I though their portions were sizable and the chicken wrap I ate was exceptionally delicious!

Our meal at Bar Tabac was a mixed bag, hence the three stars.  They have loads of outdoor seating and it is quite pleasant.  We started with cocktails that were good, and a country pate plate that was very tasty.  For mains, I tried the steak tartare- I'm a sucker for a good tartare- and my husband got a seafood risotto.  I thought a risotto was odd for a French bistro, but it was very good: the sauce was a amazing and the seafood was well cooked.  The tartare was not so great.  It had hot sauce mixed in, which basically killed the taste of the steak, and there were no toasts to spread the tartare on.  On the plus side, the frites were nice, as was the watercress salad, although the salad was overdressed.  I ordered a glass of wine with my meal and the waiter- who in fairness seemed a bit overwhelmed- brought me another cocktail instead.  Not sure how he mixed that up.  Not sure I would give this place another try.

Is Tabac French for COCKROACH?

Long story short: Minutes after getting our dinner, a HUGE cockroach ran across the wall above our heads. We didn't want to make a big deal, the waiter killed it with his hand? We lost our appetites and hurried up to finish our glass of wine and leave. No one checked in on us, no one mentioned it, no one cared that we had not even been half way through our meal.

THEN A SECOND COCKROACH FELL FROM THE CEILING AND ON TO THE SHOULDER OF THE WOMAN NEXT TO US! We all freaked out, stood up, didn't know what to do. Once again, no one cared or even asked what was going on until we told them. They asked both parties if we wanted to move tables?

The kicker: The manager walked past us while we were recovering from the falling roach and asked "Are you guys from New York or.....?"

In my seven years of living and eating in NYC, I have never seen one, let alone TWO, live roaches inside of a restaurant.

Not a penny was comped, no one checked in to see if we were okay, they carried on business as usual and my skin is still crawling. Only eat here if you are also a roach.

Food has gone down hill. The place has roaches crawling in and around the restaurant. The management and staff continue to not wear masks and social distance. They has been so irresponsible during and negligent the pandemic...it's pathetic. I will not be coming back. I won't miss being seated in the very back next to the rancid smelling toilet. You guys stink!

The food is meh at best. But more important, they are awful community members. They have been jerks throughout the pandemic, putting out hi-tops and tables since April, and encouraging people to hang around maskless.  It's not even Phase 2 as I write this, so they have no excuse.  Many members of the community have tried to speak to management, only to be dismissed.

If you want to support local businesses, you can do a lot better than this one.  They don't deserve your support.

Everything was excellent. Seared scallops salad with raspberry mousse for dessert for me, coq a vin and bread pudding for my daughter - so good. Super friendly waitress named Jessica. A little crowded but that's what I expected in NYC.

The only credit card they take is American Express.

It's rare to find an unpretentious bistro in NYC - from passing by Bar Tabac on Smith Street, it seemed to fit the bill, and so I was glad to finally confirm my suspicions over brunch on a recent weekend.

The inside is perhaps not quite as quaint as some of the pricier French bistro mainstays in Manhattan, but I appreciate the Parisian street signs hanging from the walls, and when it isn't boiling outside, sitting on the sidewalk is probably the move.

I had a cheddar and tomato omelette, which was stupendous. Not overly "eggy," which is sadly rare to find in an omelette. The home fries were perfectly seasoned, with what tasted like bits of caramelized onion sprinkled throughout.

Came for lunch and being a Saturday we got the brunch menu. All good since we wanted mussels which thankfully was on the menu.
Mrs ordered mojito and me Stella. Both satisfactory drinks, then next up were the mussels and fries.
Piled high were plump mussels in a wine wine sauce which was exactly what we craved today. Nice crusty bread was perfect to sop up the excess juice. Fries were salty not too much, just right!
Service was quick even though the place was packed, not an empty seat on the house. They have been a neighborhood staple for years and if the mussels reflect the rest of the menu then you can't go wrong here. Be aware cash or AMEX only!!!

I've been here a few times & each time I tell myself I'm going to get something different. But I always end up getting the mussels & fries. Their service is always very good & attentive. The drink menu is very good. Tip: they only accept cash & AMEX, no other cards, so bring cash. Or go to the ATM in the back.

Not going to recommend, not going to not recommend. First off, when we entered the restaurant it was so loud that we could barely talk to the waitress to get our table, and when we got there we ordered a pellegreeno (which came instantly) and a sprite (which did not come for another 10-15 minutes.) The sprite was most likely the worst part of this visit. When I tried it, it was so watery and flat I sent it back afterward the first sip.

When the food finally came like half an hour later, it was pretty bad. First off I ordered a cheeseburger with French fries. The French fries were overly salted and tasted stall and  and old. The burger was actually pretty good, but chewy and burnt at the edges and falling apart at the bun and sliding at the same time.

Not to mention the bread was AWFUL! I honestly couldn't believe that anyone would serve something that stale and old. Let's discuss the staffing, I personally didn't like the provocative women in revealing outfits on the walls and on some of the staffs t shirts.

I personally wouldn't come back to this restaurant, and definitely don't think anyone should take a party of picking (or normal for this matter) eaters. Also taking of parties there was no joke a loud party of like 15 people that were squishing into our table.

Oh and a side note, from our table we couldn't even see the live music! Just a wall that seemed decretive and un needed. So I'm going to be take back what I initially said in the beginning of my review, I would defiantly not recommend this pub/bar/ripoff to anyone!!!?!?!!

- Thanks, The Karen Of Yelp

The interior is pleasant and the waitstaff were very friendly and did a great job with explaining the menu.  The owner or manager (not sure who) also checked up on us a few times which was nice and not typical like with other restaurants.  Everyone in my party enjoyed their food but I was disappointed with my mussels entry because they were dry and had no flavor.  It seems that the chef didnt mix them well prior to serving or they stood around for too long and the juices dripped down.

My wife and I sat down at a table for dinner at the only available table outside. It happened to be next to a speaker at full volume blaring music outside for 'ambiance' - to the point where we could not hear each other speak. I politely asked our waitress if a number of things could be done: 1) what is the wait time for the next available table? 2) could we move the speaker direction so it was not facing our direction directly at our ears and possibly 3) could we turn the volume down. The response for all three was that it was not possible. Well, we kindly responded in kind that it was not possible to dine there. This was not the first negative experience we have had at Bar Tabac. Their set up for the French world cup on Smith St. was abysmal. But, with this latest experience, I am 100% confident it will be our last.

Bar Tabac is over rated and over priced in the best of times, but now they are putting the neighborhood at risk by deifying the laws to be take-out only. They are encouraging crowds to gather outside, blocking sidewalks with people not wearing masks. Their staff shows little care for health rules, with many of them not wearing masks, and their management is openly ignoring the Covid mandates.

Superb French bar with live music on some nights (Thursdays I believe) that draws a diverse, mature crowd from friends to lovers and solo diners/drinkers stopping in for a nightcap. The bartender (originally from Croatia) was delightful and great company. The band of the night was a mix of Montréal and France and cranked out some nice tunes and a few en français.

I've only been twice now, but it's always a good stop in. They carry Duvel which is a favorite and even a Pastis de Marseille if you want to get real local and real Marseillais and have a thing for anise (I don't). Stop in for some all around good vibes, good music and maybe even good French food (didn't try).

Bar tabac, à bientôt.

Came here for lunch with a party of 12 after running the Brooklyn marathon. Needless to say two of us were beyond starving. They didn't have our reservation on the list although we called in a day or two prior l, but fortunately they were able to accommodate us in the back room. Chic French bar with some good food options. My fiancé and I had the Niçoise salad, the escargot, and the Mediterranean eggs. The food was great, especially the eggs. They also had a wide variety of vegan drinks that some of the party took advantage off. I had a regular Bloody Mary and it was good. I would definitely come back to try their brunch.

My favorite burger bistro in NYC.  Makes me feel like I'm back in Montmartre at a corner spot people watching from the sidewalk table.  Welcoming waiters and bartenders, good wines by the glass, and great live music!  The chicken, goat cheese salad, mussels, everything has been spot on.  Plus it's a local spot that throws a mean block party for Bastille Day.  Regulars, happy hour, really glad Bar Tabac stands the test of time.  Delicious, merci!

On the burger hunt, you have to sample Bar Tabac for the bun alone.  Grilled onion and Rosemary embedded!  The burger is outstanding, always flavorful, cooked to order, cheese is what you'd expect in a true French bistro, fries and salad included and so good.  Plus you get live music, an outdoor seating option and great wine and beers at decent prices. Love the Tabac.

I have been to this place quite a few time because I quite like it. The food is good and it has a cute atmosphere. Always get the escargot and pate because they are both very tasty.

The service is quite relaxed but there can be a difference in how I feel about it after my meal. Most of the time its great but sometimes it feels like there is no soul.

The most recent time I was there, we had a fun waitress called Marya who was very engaging and obviously cared about our experience. Even though she forgot a few items over the meal (which was rectified when we asked her about them), this didn't detract from our overall experience because she was apologetic, and fixed it immediately.

The missing star is because once we were seated, no one came to look after us or take our drink orders for 20 minutes. We were sitting outside so not directly in sight of the wait staff. I think we even approached a porter but they didn't pay any attention to us. Eventually, we were able to get Maryas attention, who apologized and explained that this wasn't her table but will look after us from now on.

I know from years of being in this industry that there needs to be a floor plan for the restaurant, but making sure everyone is working as a team is more important than table allocation.

Either way, I think this place is great but they could work on the customer experience to enhance the meal.

Good late-night French-inspired street-corner bar / restaurant with lovely sidewalk seating and a noisy, friendly and happy crowd inside. Liquor, wine and beer flow freely here late at night and is enjoyed standing or seated at one of several bar-height tables -- all conducive to lots of interaction, loud conversation, toasting and high-fiveing.  I hear the food is good, although we were there for late evening drinks only. One restroom only however guarantees a long wait to pee.

Ok food, nothing  to write home about.
The server was nice but slow, he forgot our order and came back to apologize and offered us champagne, that was nice but not ideal.
They also took a million years to take our cash (no credit cards accepted) and bring back the change.
They didn't have skim milk or a espresso machine (just an FYI for coffee drinkers).
Ambiance was great, live music was a plus.
Would come back but wouldn't order coffee or be in a hurry.

I had relatively high expectations for this place, but the reality was mixed. Nice rustic atmosphere in Cobble Hill, with live music during dinner. And that was the first problem: far too loud because of the (unnecessary) amplification, so that conversation becomes impossible, and listening is a bit hurtful to one's ears. (And when the band is not playing their piped music is just as loud!) Food okay, and not overpriced. Try the charcuteries plate (or the combo with cheese). Good Nicoise salad. The free range chicken came with roasted potatoes that were so salty as to be almost inedible. There is much room for improvement, folks!

The owner is very fun and energetic, and that's very refreshing to see. He also educated us on some stuff. The food was good. It's a little crowded where I heard the conversation about computer systems from the table next to me. For the appetizers we ordered foie gras, calamari, and escargot. The foie gras was accompanied by beautiful spread and nice amount of bread. It was more of a pate consistency rather than the usual hard peaces we are used to. However, it was delicious and I'm sure that there are numerous ways of preparing it. For the entree we ordered mussles and steak. My steak was delicious with pepper sauce, but you have to ask for it and it's 2.50 extra. The mussels were good, but hubby felt they were a little dry on top. Their fries are the best fries that I had in a long time, and the owner basically gave us the recipie. This is definatly not a 3.5 star place unlike yelp review total. It a good place, and I really recomend you try this place and see for yourself. I'll be back for their famous burger.

I love love love sitting outdoors at Bar Tabac and having a Croque-Madame with frites, salad, and their sparkling lemonade.

Reading a book and watching the goings-on of Smith and Dean streets. Now that's enjoying life, European-style! (When it's warm enough. If not I sit indoors and admire the strange designs on the ceiling; usually the same meal.)

Idk why this place has 3 & 1/2 stars because it's literally so good. I licked my plate clean. The food is fresh, organic, free range which makes it even better. The food never fails. They make everything fresh and you can control sweetness with drinks which is awesome.

We sat for an hour without food. When the tables to the right and left of us -- who ordered after we did -- I asked the waiter if the kitchen was still "cooking" the 2 orders of steak tartare we asked for. And still the food did not arrive.

Poor service. We walked out.

There's a lot to like about Bar Tabac. There's a cool zest to the atmosphere flaunting a colorful and funky, French Bistro flair that's neither stuffy or extravagant, but, it's somewhat, rustic and a little intimate in a not-so-typical sense of the word.

Bar Tabac is rough around the edges in a very nice sort of way; with French chachkies and memorabilia throughout the restaurant. Service was very personal and we chit chatted with Jonas, who was very welcoming, attentive and made sure our dining experience would be great...

**Heads up people:
1. Unisex restroom and unkept
2. Only AMEX accepted

But what tops that is the great taste in food and drinks. Food at Bar Tabac is freshly prepared giving you rich flavors. My Seafood Risotto had delicate chunks of crab meat and topped with shrimp and scallops. My husband's hanger steak was nearly cooked to perfection dressed in a delicious wine jus. My husband's steak was nicely paired with a mushroom risotto- which, I almost ate half (since it was placed off to one side and away from the steak).

Tabac has been our go-to when we're in the area. Can't stop just yet.
