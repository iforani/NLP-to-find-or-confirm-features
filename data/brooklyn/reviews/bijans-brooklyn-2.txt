First off, kudos to Bijan's for being open everyday for service - even open late with a walk up bar - since the pandemic has started.

There menu has pretty much Remained the same. They've been able to setup tons of outdoor seating and serve all that food in to go boxes. We ordered (keto friendly) brunch here, and got a bunless burger with bacon, blue cheese, and a fried egg + steak and eggs with a side of salmon.

I think because these meals normally come with a bun, fries, etc, ours happened to look small. The burger (although petit) was really good, loved it with the red onion, blue cheese and bacon. The steak and eggs were good too, and the salmon was cooked perfectly. The portions here should've been a bit bigger for a $25 price tag plus $7 for the salmon.

Happy to support this local biz that's giving their all to serve our community!

My roommate and I made a last minute decision to stop by here for a bite, 10 minutes before their kitchen closed, and we were still seated with a smile. Their drink and cocktail menu is extensive, as well. We ordered two veggie burgers, and let me tell you, they were absolutely delicious. The service is wonderful, too. You truly feel at home here. My cup of water was never left empty, and we were consistently checked on to ensure our needs were being met. I'm so happy this restaurant is open during the COVID-19 pandemic. I will definitely be returning here.

1 star. Gave one extra bc the manager saved the day-ish.
Maybe we were there on an off day?

I think it all came down to poor service and mediocre food. We sat down and it took a while for us to get menus. ok. not a big deal. The waiter took our order but never brought us water. He was filling the water on the other tables multiple times. Was it because we ordered drinks? OK. that's not a big deal either. Then the waiting began. The drinks came about 15 min later. Then, after what felt like forever, ONE of 2 of the appetizers came out. We flagged down the waiter to have him check on the order. He said it was coming out soon. It never came. Then, ONE HOUR later, we flagged down the waiter again, and he said the entrees would be out soon.

Note, we've been at the restaurant for almost 2 hours at this point and only got drinks and 1 appetizer. During our wait, I noticed TWO tables just walk away because they weren't being serviced.

Suddenly, another waiter (probably the manager) noticed something was wrong. He came out and asked us how we were doing and we alerted him about the long wait time. Suddenly, everything was operating like a normal restaurant again. The food came out within the next 10 minutes. We told him one of the appetizers never came so he rushed it out on the house.

Now, on to the food. I didn't try the calamari but the persian spiced wings were decent and the drinks were good. They have some inventive cocktails and the flavors are tasty. But on to the entrees - I had asked the waiter if he recommended the persian kabobs or the salmon and he suggested the kabobs, which were honestly terrible. The meat had an odd crumbly texture and the beef tasted a bit.. old? I also tried the pappardelle which had no flavor and dry chicken. It was also COLD.

we live in the neighborhood and always walk by the place so we were really excited to try it but alas it was a disappointment.

Just left Bijans. And this place was a great find.
Came here mid afternoon on a Saturday. Just a table of two
Started off with some frozen margaritas-- our server pointed out that they were fresh strawberries. Drinks tasted amazingggg and def we're hitting

Also had the lamb burger with feta cheese and sweet potato fries. Boyfriend had the Bijan's burger with feta and fries and we split each burger and shared. Both burgers were amazing. The lamb burger was perfectly seasoned. Like actually the best lamb burger we have had in a while.

Great service. Great food. Great service. Will be back
Upset I didn't snag I picture.

Went recently had outdoor seating on street which was nice and relaxed. Staff was very friendly and allowed us to bring our dog. Main downside was we were underwhelmed with food. Got truffle fries for $8 which didn't come with a dipping sauce just ketchup packets. Roasted eggplant dip was good but thought the pita chips were overcooked slightly. Best thing was probably the chicken kebab and rice, large portion. Spicy shrimp flatbread was unique but also not sure I'd need to come back to try it again. Overall, good service and atmosphere however food wasn't worth price.

While visiting my son in NYC we decided on my last nite in NYC to go for Persian food! I live in Los Angeles and there are 100s Persian restaurant and i was surprised at how hard of a time i had to find them here in NYC! We went to Bijan, I invited my son's girlfriend and her brother as well, by the name of Bijan, and looking through menu I was sure this would be a great way for me to introduce them to my native country food! I ordered kashkeh badenjoon an eggplant appetizer, the one they brought us tasted like eggplants but lacked kashk (cream of whey), i also ordered mast o moosir dish made of yogurt and shallot, ours was yogurt and onions no shallots and tasted horrid! Salad shirazi a salad made of cucumbers, tomatoes, onions in olive oil and lime juice, which tasted somewhat like it tho needed more lime juice and olive oil, for entres i ordered special of the day Gheymeh a dish of meat stew added cinnamon, dried limes and crunchy dried thin french fries! Ours was meat stew w dried limes and actual french fries on top!  I also ordered ground chicken kabob, ground beef kabob and a chicken item from menu which was not a persian dish!  the kabobs ABSOLUTELY did not taste like kabob!! I was so saddened cuz our guests ddnt get to taste wht true persian food tasted!
May I I plz i make a suggestion?! Either rename ur dishes to not be Persian name to do justice to the culinary or simply take all persian items out of ur menu, You are doing unjust to our native culinary!! i gave one star for cocktails and service! Overall the WORST Persian food I hav ever tasted:(

My party of 2 stopped here for dinner after seeing a show at Barclays center (a little less than a mile away) and we got here around 11 PM on a Thursday and we had about 20 minutes before the kitchen closed.

Everything from the dim lit ambiance to the food was amazing! We ordered the calamari (which was crispy and seasoned well) and the beef stew dinner special and the lamb burger. Both were amazing!

We were just happy to find a spot open that late on a weekday for dinner but this place exceeded our expectations! We will definitely be back!

Cash only brunch
Poor service overall
Average food, very basic - served in takeaway plates and plastic so not worth the trip.
Serving brunch (until 4PM) and not lunch as advertised until.
Had an (very) bad experience and will definitely not come back. I'm all for local restaurants but this place doesn't live up to expectations.

Been meaning to visit this neighborhood favorite for a while now and I finally made it for Sunday Brunch.

Fist of- they have a fireplace! So cozy to walk in on a cold rainy Sunday. Their decor is rustic and homey. Very welcoming. The tables seemed to be a decent size- not too big or not too small just right for the space.

The restaurant offers a prefix menu that comes with either coffee or tea, a drink and an entr√©e all for the price of $20 which I think is a great deal for this neighborhood. The prefix menu was pretty extensive and very accommodating to vegetarians (as I am).

I ordered a coffee, drink called Persian kiss and the Persian omelette. The coffee came first, it was pretty decent, nothing to rave about but also nothing to complain about. The Persian kiss was delightful and in my opinion original as I've never had a proseco with pomegranate juice before. The Persian omelette came with a side salad. I had requested an egg white omelette instead of regular eggs and the restaurant was able to accommodate my request. The omelette was delicious. Just the right amount of sweet and salty as a Persian omelette should be. Side salad was fresh and crunchy just like I like it.

Overall a great restaurant and a neighborhood gem.

Bijan is sweet spot super close to our place. Usually they have brunch reservation availability on opentable that's where we booked it from. (This could be a one time experience) but seeing the reviews we were really excited to try this place. A little bit disappointed in the service. Our food was ok but overall our experience wasn't great because of our server. She was really rude to us and despite telling her that the table was shaking and she had a number of empty tables she refused to move us and kept leaving without answering any questions or taking any orders. Probably we will revisit this place to try out again!

Came by Sunday after church and tried the prix fix brunch menu.
I was totally sold.
Your meal comes with coffee and a drink.
Everything was delicious, we had the bojan cocktail and Persian kiss. To eat we had the two eggs plate and the pancakes.

A lovely and warm spot that is about comfort and not spectacle, perfect for a relaxing Sunday brunch experience. In the ever competitive Brooklyn restaurant scene, locally owned and kind places - where the owner is proudly working the floor - might get lost in all the rush of new places with the trendy item du jour and much Insta snapping.

Bijan deserves your support for its gentle Persian twist on brunch, its relaxed and friendly service, and Stephanie, the owner, who graciously welcomes you into her home. We were here for Sunday brunch, where $20 gets you a nice entree, coffee or tea, and one cocktail. We had the Persian omelet, with dates inside for a twist, and a tasty two eggs any style with bacon and potatoes. Whole grain and rye toast were immediately brought to the table: the rye was especially good.

We had a pomegranate with prosecco and awesome hot toddys - with mint added. Last, but not least, was a fantastic home made tiramisu, at Stephanie's recommendation and with our server's hearty endorsement.

In short: Bijan's has good food, fair prices, pleasant service, a relaxing environment, and a proud and lovely local owner. We will definitely be back!

Covid Review: They are definitely short staffed and strugggggling, but you know what's free and easy? Good customer service and communication.  If you can't provide a customer with a menu and or say 'I'll be with you in a moment/asap, I'm swamped'...or hell anything at all, you should consider limiting the number of tables you have available - even though you only have 4, sigh. I waited 8 mins for water to come/ a human - then nothing was said, just thrown on the table haha. I understand restaurants want/need you to work with them during covid times, but that doesn't mean consumers just have to accept just anything. I had the Persian Kiss cocktail...too much pomegranate juice and flat prosecco.  Ugh I wanted to like this place maybe I will try again next year, but for now, nah. Also, the online menu prices are wrong FYI. Hope you have a better experience, the food smelled ok, though I over heard a man stating they messed up his order.

Stopped by on a rainy day for lunch.  Cute place.

Had the lavender vodka cocktail.  Didn't know it was happy hour so that was a nice surprise!  Nice cocktail.

Had the Bijan's burger and it's good.  Fries are yummy.

4 of us reserved a table for dinner at Bijan's on a Saturday evening. We got given a lovely spot by the window. The restaurant is very cute with lots of plants. Service was very good and smooth. I would have loved the menu to be slightly more Persian but I understand it's only a take on their cuisine. Three of us ordered beef stew of the day with rice and a small tomato salad and my husband took chicken kebab with rice. Everyone's food was very tasty. We also had some pita with 4 dips to nibble on. Perhaps they should work on making those a bit more varied.
And their lime/vodka cocktail was one of the best I've ever had. Great little spot for a summer meal. Good for dates also. Will be back.

I enjoyed coming here with friends for cocktails, everyone likes their cocktails so a great happy hour spot! I usually enjoy their fries here too especially the ones that come with their burger. The ambience is great though the spot can get crowded depending on when you go.

Delicious food, grossly overpriced. We got the Persian noodle soup ($14) and two side dishes of roasted eggplant and garlic yogurt ($7 each) and were very disappointed in the portion size. The soup was super yummy, but small for $14 and the two sides were RIDICULOUS for $7. It was basically robbery, it was almost disrespectful to give such little food and charge so much.

Cute place, but probably won't be back due to high prices and small portions despite the food being good.

Been here a few times and have never been disappointed. They have excellent cocktails and range of quality food options. The burger was very well prepared and had great flavor. The herb fries are addicting and the wings are delicious.

I ordered the Smoked Eggplant appetizer and Lamb Burger. I've never had anything like the Smoked Eggplant before -- the dip has an almost jelly-like texture with a smoky flavor. It tasted okay but I probably won't order it again. The Lamb Burger was delicious though -- perfectly cooked, juicy, and with a generous serving of thin cut sweet potato fries. The burger itself was smaller than expected, but with the fries the dish really fills you up. Overall, it was a good experience and I'll definitely come again!

I found Bijan's on Yelp long before I even moved to this neighborhood and desperately wanted to love it. Heck, I wanted this to be my new go-to - decor with plenty of character, unique Persian dishes, minutes away from where I knew I would be living..

But truth be told, it wasn't until my third visit to Bijan's that the food appealed to me even in the slightest. The chicken with mashed potatoes and green beans is the dish that gave Bijan's a spark of hope in my mind, but even that entree could use some much needed improvements - the green beans were completely raw and crunchy, as was the garlic sprinkled on them. The chicken leg, although well-spiced and a generous enough portion for two meals, was very dry and made me wish I had a bit more gravy for it and for the potatoes. The sweet chili wings are actually quite good here and I would order them again.

I have also ordered the onion soup, the smoked eggplant mezze, and the bbq pulled pork flatbread here, all of which were extremely underwhelming and left me regretting ordering them. My boyfriend actually had to send the steak and fries back, which is something I never see him do. The crack soup with the chicken broth, rice noodles, and shredded chicken, fresh red onion, bean sprouts would be something I would come back for regularly, but it was impossibly salty, I couldn't eat it and send it back. Such perfect soup ruined by one too many salty chicken bouillon cubes. Ugh, I already know I would be so temped to order it again in hope the chef would take it easy on the salt.. Most food absolutely needs work.

The service is spotty at best. The moody bartenders and servers often seem annoyed while taking orders and then eagerly rush off to chat with their friends at the bar, leaving customers forgotten. The fact that dinner on a Sunday night will easily turn into an over two hour affair (even if you order right as you sit down and don't order drinks) is definitely not ideal either.

The vibe and decor alone deserve 5 stars. I love the black and white Charlie Chaplin movies playing on the big screen, the cozy little fireplace, and the whole strategically unfinished look of this place. However, decor and vibe alone are just half of what I look for in a great restaurant.

Beautiful decor, super friendly staff, and a unique menu. My favourite brunch place in Brooklyn.

1. Restaurant: Warm and colourful decor, a happy place!

2. Food: a unique cuisine! Ever heard of date palms in an omelette? Yes, you'll get that here!

3. Service: they make you feel like home!

Bijan's has been on my friendly neighborhood bookmarks since I moved to the area, so I suggested we try it out when my cousin stopped by for dinner. I think my expectations were a little off the mark from the get-go because I was expecting something very Persian and a more traditional restaurant. I didn't realize that Bijan's started as a bar, hence the giant TV playing football above our heads. It seemed to conflict with the semi-bohemian vibe I had gotten when we walked in, but most of the guests seemed more interested in the food and conversation anyway.

We started off with the Flower Bomb and Lolita cocktails, and both went for the Lamb Burger with sweet potato fries. My Flower Bomb was floral and a bit heady. I actually enjoyed my cousin's Lolita a little more; the cucumber was strong and refreshing.

I'm not sure what I was expecting from the lamb burger, but it was just... a burger. Nothing special about it, just a solid lamb burger on a bun with lettuce and onion. Maybe I was expecting some fun sauces or explosive flavor or something? It was cooked well, but no real wow factor. Next time I would definitely add some kind of cheese (it didn't come with any on!). The sweet fries, on the other hand, were perfectly thin and crispy -- my favorite.

The service was great and it's a sweet atmosphere for a meal, but the food was overall just OK on our visit. I'd definitely stop by again to try the flatbreads or other tasty-looking options and hopefully find something that will wow me!

Very average food.. super salty salad. Steer away from the papardelle as well.
The cocktail was avg at best and even the beer was flat.

Go to any other place by cobble Hill.

If I didn't have lunch and wasn't super hungry.. I doubt I would have had my food here..

How one can oversalt a simple salad is beyond me.

Also it's cash friendly and all prices on menu are based on cash prices.
Service v avg. No one came to even ask how the food was did we need anything else.. nothing. It was a slumberous disappointing meal.

Great food I have no complaints here. Everything my friends and I are were good. Unfortunately their fryer didn't work so we weren't able to taste the sides that originally came with our order. Luckily the substitutes available were a great replacement. Side salads were not dull and looked like something I could just slap together at home. They added vegetables and a unique dressing which I couldn't put my finger on what it was exactly.

My friends and I had a round of Bijan's Burgers just prepared different ways. The only gripe was the extra charge for cheese. I think it was a big steep just to add a slice. I ordered a medium well which was more well than made but was still good. It just not the medium well I asked for, but didn't ruin anything for me.

Drinks were amazing I had a flower bomb and my friends both had different red wines. They both said they loved it.

The server was good and let us know about any changes ASAP. It wasn't his fault. Probably because we can later in the night that a lot of things were sold out, and the fryer needed to be fixed. Lol Outside factors he couldn't control. He was attentive and quick which was all we needed and mattered.

The ambiance was great and cozy. I couldn't stop looking around while conversing with my friends. Actually one of our topics of conversation was how the place looked and the paintings. It was lovely and nice. Plus they played a whole assortment of music which I loved. It fit the scene of the establishment well. Only thing one of my fiends didn't really like was the seating. It would of been great to have more comfortable chairs. I didn't have much of a problem. Glad the chairs had a back piece so I could rest my back on.

We also ended the night with some dessert. My friend and I both shared one tiramisu and one vanilla cheesecake. Even though I was more in a mood for tiramisu; I personally loved the cheesecake more. It has such a rich flavor worth telling y'all about.The desserts as the only thing I took pictures last night. The presentation was so pretty! I couldn't resist. You can also tell by the pictures to how warm and cozy the place was. Well at least I think so.

Still we were all agree, we would and will come back to this place. More to try!

Cute, romantic, and hip little spot. There was a silent movie being showed. Service was fast. I felt relaxed and chilled here. Onion soup was good but my burger was very salty. My husband also said his burger was way too salty. I ordered a frisky whiskey and I felt that I was under poured and over loaded with ice. Martini was good.

Very average brunch. My boyfriend and I stopped by here on a Saturday afternoon and the restaurant was empty. I think that should have been a sign because most brunch spots are poppin' from 11am-2pm. Well it was not at Bijan's. The music was also super loud for a 12:30pm brunch. They were playing club music and finally lowered it when a family came in because they had a baby.
The decor was very hippy/save the planet feel. They had communal tables and a lot of plants. I gave 2 stars mostly for the server. She was very kind and attentive.

Now for the food:
- I ordered the breakfast pizza and asked for the eggs to be over easy. I thought everyone knew you don't cook the yolk for over easy eggs! The chef there did not because my eggs were well done and it was not nice on the breakfast pizza. I was hoping there would be some egg porn action and it would be all creamy and delicious with my pizza but no, it was way overcooked and not what I envisioned at all.
-My boyfriend being his basic self ordered the eggs with sausage and it came with potatoes and toast. When the food came the kitchen messed up and gave him really overcooked bacon. I mean we all like crispy bacon, but not like disintegrating bacon...The server was kind enough to just add the sausage on the side. His scramble eggs did not look appetizing either.

Sigh it was such a disappointing meal. I mean at least we didn't have to wait long for food. Maybe dinner is better? However, the brunch really made me not want to go back to try other things.

The most ridiculous customer service I've ever experienced. Walk in without reservation, hostess told me that they don't have table for me. I left and made reservation right that minute through Open Table. They had tables every 15 min on both Open Table AND Yelp.  I showed them that they are available and also my reservation, after seeing it they call me a "mean person", "drama" and told me that I will not have table tonight even though I had a reservation. I have never felt so offended and discriminated against.

I always enjoy Bijan for Brunch, Lunch or Dinner. I find it a cozy and a warm relaxing place to eat with chill music. So love their Persian Omelet w/ Baby Greens, Bijan Burgers w/ herb fries, Onion Soup, Flatbreads~ Margherita, Veggie & White are delicious too!
The Staff has always been very pleasant and accommodating.
It's just a nice local go to Restaurant in the neighborhood. :)

Cute little spot

Made a reservation here on a Saturday for brunch.

Loved the food and vibe, but they don't accept cards on weekends. (there is an ATM across the street in a deli) but this was an inconvenience since their pages states they do accept credit cards.
We got eggs Benedict and the Persian chicken sandwich. Both were pretty good. I would come back to try other dishes because the food is good!

We each got a couple of cocktails. The one with the cayenne pepper and the pineapple was really good. I would skip the one with the lavender, as it has actual dried lavender in it, which was annoying to drink around.

It wasn't too busy to my surprise, usually its very busy, but if you can - make reservations

They have an actual real fire place, making this place super cozy! (but don't sit next to it because it gets smoky)

Came here for dinner and drinks after seeing some rave reviews on Yelp. The menu looks great and has a great variety on it. We tried the lamb burger which I had with truffle fries. The burger was dry and crumbling and the fries were very oily, was not able to finish either.  Had tiramisu after which was very good.

Service was great and so were the drinks.

This place has a beautiful decor. The food was good. I think that next time I come back I would stick with the burger options. I got the wings and the shrimp with spaghetti squash, but the spaghetti squash only had like 3 shrimp for $16. I think I would have gotten more for my money with the burger and fries. The service was great. I came here on a Thursday night at 1130 and even though the kitchen was closing they accommodate me because I made a reservation on Yelp. It was my fiance's birthday and they gave us a small cake in the house. My fiance had the lamb burger which was delicious, might I add I don't eat lamb, but I tried a bite and it was so good. Will definitely return to try the burger next time I'm in bk late night.

I have lived near this place for years, yet never went until a few months ago. All I can say, is that the atmosphere, food, and service was wonderful. There are many places to go in Cobble Hill, but we will certainly return.

Ever since Bijan's opened up six years ago, happy days are here again. Literally: one time I walked in and Happy Days was playing on the TV.

Fonzie aside, I'm STILL so happy Bijan's is here. It's no longer the new bar on the block, but the seasoned vet that's got regulars, understands our quirks, and gives the neighborhood what it needs. The vibe is intimate, but casual. The music is always good, which makes it the perfect place to kick off your night with a quiet drink, especially since happy hour is very solid.

Best of all, the kitchen is open (and has been, these past 5.5 years), and the food is solid across the board. Brunch is a solid deal (cocktail, food, coffee, juice, all for $17), and the dinner menu has enough variety that everyone can find something to eat. They've got burgers and flatbreads and mezze (they lean a little Middle Eastern), but in my opinion, you can't go wrong with chicken.

The Persian-spiced wings are done right, and the rosemary, lime, sumac chicken is a staple of my diet. Both sound more exotic than they are; the latter is just a perfectly roasted airline breast over haricot verts and truffle mashed potatoes, with a lovely pan sauce to tie it all together. It's a full, balanced, excellent meal for under $20. Enjoy it by the fireplace in winter, and with the doors open in the summer.

It can get a little packed during happy hours or weekend nights in the small space, but the service is always friendly and the drinks are always good. The menu no longer lists the therapeutic benefits of the cocktail ingredients pumpkin, mint, chili pepper, etc., but I still feel good about having five of them in a sitting.

If I was in danger of spending entirely too much time here before they started serving food 5.5 years ago, there's definitely no hope for me now.

Ever since Bijan's opened up, happy days are here again. Literally: one time I walked in and Happy Days was playing on the TV.

Fonzie aside, I'm so happy Bijan's is here. It's about a block away from me, and I can't imagine a better bar to have in the 'hood. The vibe is intimate, but casual. The music is always good, which makes it the perfect place to kick off your night with a quiet drink. As the hour gets later, the soul/funk gives way to more danceable tunes, so it's also a much better late-night spot than my apartment.

And I'm definitely not just saying that because your drunk ass spilled wine on my carpet last time.

It can get a little packed in the small space, but the service is always friendly and the drinks are always good. Larry seems to be behind the bar more often than not, and this is a good thing. He's one of the friendliest, funniest guys around, and spot on with his mixing of the medicinal cocktails on the menu. I love that each drink description tells you the therapeutic benefits of that pumpkin, mint, chili pepper, etc. It makes me feel that much better about having five of them in a sitting.

Good music, good drinks, good vibe...I'm already in danger of spending entirely too much time here. And to top it off, the kitchen is opening in early February...at which point I won't even have to leave to go eat things so I can come back and drink more.

Better get used to it, Larry, you're gonna see way more of me than anyone really wants to.

Such a cozy and cute spot for a weekend brunch. Came here with my fianc√© while wandering around boreum hill, we were intrigued by the $20 brunch special (entree, coffee, and a cocktail). I had the Bijan cocktail which was really delicious and came out beautiful. Got the eggs Benedict which costs $7 extra on top of the $20 special. The Benedict was solid and came with fries and a salad. Surprised to see so many negative reviews about service, our waitress was very attentive and sweet, she checked on us multiple times and was constantly refilling the waters
