My fingers can't move quick enough to express what a lovely evening I had just the other day in this fine establishment. Let me begin with the brilliant, classy, knowledgable mixologist behind the bar. As I approached the bar it almost seemed that he knew what I wanted to order.

Bored? Not in this bar. They have a lovely dart board and a pool table that is placed strategically in the center of the bar. ****Please DO NOT place your beverage on the table***** the condensation from the glass will damage the fine solid oak.

I was here a few months back, and totally forgot to post about how awful it was as I tried to delete this place from my brain. You would want to as well.

The place is run by someone who is often drunk, and will yell terrible things at you (racist, homophobic, etc).

There is truly no reason to support a bigot who does not welcome all into his place of business.

This place sucks, played a gig here years ago and accidentally left my guitar, called and the bartender said they had. So the next day I go to pick it up and the owner wouldn't give it to me. He straight up said he had it, but wasn't giving it to me. A-hole stole my damn guitar.
Also have heard a ton of stories of the owner being racist and homophobic. This place should get shut down. Honestly thought it was or I would've left a bad review years ago. Don't support that jerk.

Just so it's clear the owner of this Bar is a racist and a homophobic asshole. He likes to stand outside and make racist remarks to woman of color on the street waiting for the bus. This place needs to be shut down! As you can see from other reviews the owner and bartenders harass their customers and people on the street. Greenpoint folks stop supporting racist business owners!

Negative stars. The owner is a known racist. Spend that drink money donating to a good cause or supporting a black-owned business before you literally give your dollars to racists. Don't support racism institutions like this one and spend your money elsewhere.

Can't wait till this bar finally goes out of business for good! Owner gets drunk and throws his own parties above the bar once a month. Disrupting the whole surrounding community.

This bar is run by a man who thinks it's acceptable behavior to yell racial slurs at his black neighbors. DO NOT SUPPORT THIS BUSINESS! Supporting this business means accepting that this behavior is tolerated. Black lives matter and we don't need a bar in our neighborhood that discriminates against people based on the color of their skin. We need safe spaces to congregate and celebrate and that cannot be achieved in an environment that leads with hate. Greenpoint is better than this so please make a statement by taking your business to bars that don't perpetrate racism.

Walked in this place on a Friday and it smelled like a dirty subway cart first of all. My girl went to use the restroom and as I was reading the beer list alone the bartender rudely asked "can I help you guys" while he finished his beer, I said I'm just taking a look as I waited for my group to join me after smoking outside. When they came in, not only 2 minutes later the bartender yelled and kicked us out without any cause, we didn't even exchange more than a sentence and he screamed from across the room to get out . Fuck this place Id rather drink in an alley way

This was the worst place I've ever been to! It smelled like a homeless person in there. The cherry on top was the horrible, drunk bartender's customer service. He was erratic and rude before I even got the chance to order. Other yelpers mentioned that proud boys met here. I hope this place does the community a favor and goes out of business soon.

The sign says $4.00 for the beer. They charged me $5.00 over and over again. Then mentioned they "forgot" to update the price on their list on their wall.

Also the bartenders insulted me to each other at the end of their bar. Did they not think that their LOUD whispers would not carry in a nearly empty space with no music playing?

I'm glad this place is closed everytime i walk by. IDK if it's for good but I sure hope so.

Note to all gays and friends of gays: if you don't like the idea that this place employs a bartender who feels totally comfortable throwing around the f-word, spend your hard-earned dollars elsewhere.

We spent some time here on Saturday night, June 4th -- two couples, one straight, one gay. We were having a nice time playing stupid songs on the jukebox and playing pool, having drinks and tipping accordingly -- until the female bartender (who was sucking down a spiked big gulp the entire time) jokingly called one of the patrons a word that starts with F and rhymes with maggot. I think we said something like "Whoa whoa! That's some extreme language" and she said, "That's okay, he's my friend." My boyfriend pointed at me and said, "Well he's my BOYfriend, so please don't use that word." She responded with something like, "I should just keep my mouth shut." (Side note: that's true.)

We probably should have left immediately because moments later she doubled down and intentionally used the same word again and laughed. We headed for the door, declining to leave a tip for the last round. As we were leaving, she shouted at the door, "Thanks for the tip, MAGGOTS!". (Except she didn't say maggots.)

If you are LGBT or love someone who is, avoid this place, and let your friends know the same.

To quote the great David Chappelle, what can I say about Tommy's Tavern that hasn't been said about Afghanistan, Its bombed out and depleted. What more could you want from a bar, classless, Panglossian yet Dismal and if Feng Shui were to manifest itself into human form and walk into Tommy's Tavern it would immediately Succumb to AIDS. Imagine the house from Fight Club and a dumpster from behind a Red Lobster in Louisiana in August in the mid days sun right before its scheduled pick up had a child, that child would be Tommy's Tavern.

What can be said about this gem.that hasn't already been said! This place harkens back to a time when Brooklyn was the center of the universe. If you listen carefully enough you can hear the whispers of the Tammanyites and the natavists. The barkeeps couldn't be more accomodating making sure the glasses are properly topped off and no request was denied. I even witnessed a quite dapper gentleman enjoying a refreshing Fanta. Don't pass this tavern up. You'll know you're home the minute you walk through the door.

This Tavern was great! The staff was wonderful, and very funny. I enjoyed them because they were real and enjoyed the customers company. The food was good, we would definitely go back. I would suggest anyone Who lives near Tommy's tavern to visit it often and support them.

I heard that this was to be my go to dive bar where I'm moving, so I was pretty excited that a friend was going to be playing a show. I walked in, and instead of the usual dark, cozy dives that I love, I was met with a pretty cold and uncomfortable atmosphere.

It feels as if the owners had at one time attempted to update the bar, what with the strangely shaped sofas and gigantic, digital juke box. There was just something totally off about this place and I couldn't really handle it.

The Schaefer was cheap, and their happy hour deals are good, but what's the point of sitting in a dive if you can't have fun? Guys, I just wanna get my dirty drank on and be done with it! Unfortunately, the female bartender had no smiles to give.

In addition to the unsettling vibes, a girl my friend knew showed the staff her passport to be served (she is 23), and they demanded her green card. She doesn't have one. She was VISITING. I've never heard of a passport not being enough identification, and at that point I was honestly read to leave. Pair all that with a shitty sound system, and the only redeeming thing about my night was the fact that a band playing (Eloise) rocked the house and there was a cab really close by for our speedy departure.

Me: "It smells like piss in here."
Him: "WHAT?!"
Me: "IT SMELLS LIKE PISS."
Him: "WHAT?!?!"

This place is loud yet empty, with a heaping helping of nasty. There's a back room for noise bands to do their thing in, and a front room in which aging hippies can wax nostalgic when they're not too busy looking at your legs.

You all are talking crazy talk! This bar is amazing. It just depends what you're looking for. Me? I'm looking for a real dive that reminds me of my former and beloved days in Columbus, Ohio. And if you, too, are looking for what I describe below, Tommy's is as good as it gets.

It's all of two feet by two feet inside, and there is poorly written graffiti on the walls decrying "Tommy's Fuckin' Tavern" or something equally ridiculous like that.  You will most assuredly get bashed in the middle with a pool cue, because most of the two feet by two feet are being used up by a very popular pool table. I was astounded to find locals of the Midwestern  type inside Tommy's - and can't help but wonder if these misshapen Iron Maiden-tshirt-wearing folk are in fact transplants from my beloved former place of residence. The drink menu for Tommy's is - wait for it - poorly scrawled on a piece of printer paper and taped up behind the bar. I ordered a beer in a can called a Schaeffer, and it was joyously anticlimactic. Tosh.0 was on the TV, but this was readily drowned out by such choice jukebox selections as Social Distortion, Metallica, and yes, Rancid. This experience was completed by the fact that some very rough-around-the-edges looking lesbians were making out in the corner.

Now, it might sound like the Midwest - and Tommy's - are places you never, ever want to go. And let me tell you, maybe you don't. After all, someone else's review says something is a bit "off" about this place. And it's true. However, this is by no means the epitome of the Midwest, just the seedy underbelly of the Midwest (endearing in the way that 1970s Times Square porn houses are endearing) that I have never seen before in New York... until Tommy's. My cousin and I walked by it looking for Saint Vitus a couple weeks ago, and though Tommy's doesn't havea  sign, some bearded down-home gentlemen were hanging around outside, and we both agreed that whatever that place was, it would be an "Ohio bar"... and we right.

I'll be back, Tommy's... I'll be back.

I used to live a few blocks away from this bar, so I visited it a couple times. My experiences varied from scary to interesting. Once I saw glass and blood on the sidewalk outside of this bar and my roommate told me that it's nicknamed the "stab bar." One evening I was offered coke and a trip to Atlantic City by some local patrons.  I have since seen the woman that offered me a trip to AC outside of a laundry mat. I don't think she remembered me or the promised trip. I plan on going back to refresh her memory and see if I can still tag along.

After reading the reviews here was kinda scared to go meet my friends who were playing there. And it was a really fun night. No awful bartender, they were super friendly it was super divey and the crew that worked there was quite awesome. But I will say there was a man punched in the face and I DO think his nose was broken...but he was asking for it...

Wendy L. summed it up pretty well: I too saw a customer fight with the barkeep.  Some guy that was hopped up on coke slugged the female bartender and ran off.  I chased him down, got the police involved and then I was considered the narc and felt threatened in the bar.  This is the only place in Brooklyn I'll never return to.

Ugh. You mean Murder Bar? No thanks. It won some sort of obnoxious award from the Village Voice a few years ago for being the loudest bar in NYC.  Lately they've been doing what look like hardcore shows.  Drawing big crowds, and those folks seem into it.  It's just not my scene.

I went to a birthday show that was held here for it's dive-y atmosphere. From all accounts I would think that was the most people that place had seen in a single night- you'd think that the bartender would be thrilled at the prospect of all those tips- but it just seemed like she was pissed that she had to work at all.  Her mixed drinks were decidedly missing alcohol- and when I ordered a round of shots in honor of my boyfriend's birthday (okay, this may sound gross- it's half whiskey half Jager- try it!) she had the nerve to roll her eyes and make a snide comment... and then proceeded to charge me $7/shot.  Whatever- that was only $56... at least I saw her pour them, and it was actually alcohol (compared to my first drink).  I totally was stupid enough to tip her like $9- her attitude still didn't improve.  I mean seriously?!  Anyway, stick with beer and shots if you see the skinny, miserable blond with the tats behind the bar.

In all fairness, I gave this place two stars because there is a tiny backroom where bands play- the main reason the party was there.  It was cool to see bands (which were totally amazing) rock out in such a tiny space-  everyone can really get into the music and totally makes the atmosphere awesome.

I have a tolerance for crap bars. But the bartender here was just awful. Ignoring customres, insulting customers - and these were people who were buying drinks and tipping. If I wanted that I would have stayed home. F her and f this place. I'll not return.

Warning to other NYC bands! If you book a gig here be prepared to bring everything you own. The only thing this place has as far as equipment is a p.a. system and a barebones one at that. No microphones, a couple of shotty cables, and some mic stands. You'll be lucky if  you even get a sound guy to help you find the working cables in the rat pit of tangled chords and cables that are by the mixing board. You'll probably have to do your own sound too. Don't count trying to get a hold of the bar before your gig either. They'll never contact you back, and their website hasn't been updated since we were all using dial-up. I'm not saying we had a bad gig, because you can make it work, but this ain't like the other places you book gigs in NYC.  Beer was cheap, whiskey was watered down.
