My lover and I love this spot. Literally. Love it. The tenders of the bar are wise and talented; a vip combo for top-notch bar talent. Like, who would have known that an Old Fashioned can level-the-fuck-up with rye instead of whiskey? Not me. Not my lover (even though he is totally brill). But you know who did know? The bartender at Long Island Bar, that's who! Everyone here should be pretentious because they are so talented but honestly, they are just really sweet. My favorite employee is one of the runners. He's so nice and is always smiling. My only complaint, and my lover shares it too (we share most things), is that they changed the name of the Lady Burger. Apparently some annoying-ass SJWs complained about the smaller burger being gendered. Assholes. Does gender not exist? Can we not refer to anything as female anymore? Whenever my lover go in and order Lady Burger we joke for like 20 minutes about how annoying it is that people complained about the name of the burger. The LI Bar employees are always really patient with our complaining about it and sometimes joke with us - even though - apparently - a lot of people make fun of the people who complained about the Lady Burger. You'd think that they'd be rolling their eyes at us, but I've never seen them do it visibly. Whatever. I'm not going to let those whiney Lady-Burger-complainers erase my femaleness. I will always order the Lady Burger when I order whatever it is called now. With the pandemic going on, the place I miss the absolute most is Long Island Bar. I miss going there with my lover! I'm just praying that it won't shut down. Praying.

This place is the best. Honestly, go here. I'm not an expert on cheese curds per say, but if I had to guess, their cheese curds are the best in the world. They also have amazing French fries. The staff is super nice and helpful!!! We go here at least once every couple weeks.

We are lucky to live steps away from this gem. The drinks are phenomenal and the cheese curds are a requirement. The wait can be daunting but it's worth it!! Love seeing them thrive in these weird times and more than happy to keep coming back.

Stopped in here for a few over priced drinks. I've been in here before so I was expecting that.  What I wasn't expecting was the wise attitude by the bartender.

The bartender was simply so rude to me and my 2 lady guests. I almost could not believe it!  The 2 other staff members were just standing there looking spineless, ineffective and sheepish. I think they were embarrassed about his behavior.

Try it out if you want...but if you sit at the bar I guarantee you'll get some kind of flip-ass comment.   In this day an age, I vote with my wallet and wouldn't come back here if you paid me.  Many other options for food and drinks, just steps away.

Long Island Bar is multipurpose, with one of the better vibes in the area; the kind of place you wish was down the block from your apartment where you can roll up with a book and eat solo at the bar or bring a friend for a nightcap.

Really a great spot, don't skip the fries or the house cocktails.

Still a solid choice for the area. Lovely waitress served us lovely cocktails and lovely wine in the very fun and retro setting. I'm glad that this joint has stuck it out in the great real estate battle that is cool things staying open in NYC in the face of crazypants landlords. RIP our brother, the Jakewalk

Oh hi bartender from Jakewalk! Happy to see your able hands crafting my cocktail!

Tight little menu of snacks and cocktails. I easily tossed back a few lemony gin situations before I realized it. I recommend. All. Yes all. I noticed folks coming in with pizza boxes so perhaps outside food is allowed?

It's an old diner, which as a lifetime New Yorker brings me a nostalgic joy I can't fully explain. I will not lie, the booth benches are original so they have weird sinking parts so you may have to shuffle your tush around a bit before you find your spot. Maybe they will refurbish them sometime soon I hope so please?

Come here for a really excellent burger. Delicious. Fries were a little too overdone for my taste, but others at my table loved them. The cheese curds were excellent! Having recently gone to Minnesota, I would say this is right up there as far as quality.  I would definitely come back.

It's like a diner but without the affordable prices! Everything is like classic diner things but double the price.

Also they have a very sexist "ladies burger" which is the regular burger except with one patty instead of two.

I went to this place with my cousins, we got there at about 7:30pm. Even though I arrived earlier (10min or so) and there was no wait, by the time they arrived, we had to wait about 15min for a table.

Once we got seated, there was at least 10-12min between getting menus, getting drinks, then getting our order. They were busy, but service did seem rather slow. We ordered a fish bite appetizer that was tasty, if a little salty.

I ordered the lady burger and while pleased to see an ample helping of fries and good cheese on the burger, the lettuce was practically drowned and the whole burger, while savory and well charred was just really salty.

That plus the slow service made it a place that's really worth just trying once, maybe on a slower evening. It was a Saturday.

We had a TERRIBLE customer service experience here.  The bar/restaurant was not crowded on a beautiful evening in September.  We had reserved a table in the back of the bar to start our night (at 5:30 PM).  Despite no other demand for tables or reservations coming in, the manager was very rude and aggressive and made us feel unwelcome.  She engaged our group in a nasty way several times in the two hours we were there - making us feel uncomfortable and criticizing us for bringing a large group to the bar (which is counter-intuitive, since you'd think they'd want to sell more food/drinks).  Ultimately, we decided to leave and go to Henry Public across the street - which was happy to accommodate and sell us food and drinks for the rest of the night.  Sad that I cannot recommend Long Island Bar.  I also followed up with the manager to notify him of our experience.

Amazing burger, beer and vibes! Super cute "diner" with a twist. Cute and cozy, but big enough. The burger was amazing, a different unique taste with the cheese. Definitely a must try.

Gem in the neighborhood. The cocktails are so delicious and the burger we shared was decadent. The staff is friendly and the vibe is upbeat and cool. It's a great spot to start a late night, catch up with old friends or indulge on a weeknight. The crowd can be a bit rowdy but it adds to the fun.

This is, simply, my favorite restaurant/bar in Brooklyn. I've eaten here monthly for years, and they've never missed a beat.

The cocktails are an emblem of intelligence and restraint. The burgers are unique, without having any sort of gimmick.
The trout, the carrot salad, the octopus, even the mixed nuts are delicious and refined.

Add to this their amazing decor, and staff who are balanced perfectly between hospitable and reserved, and a huge sign that says "NO DANCING."

It's just the best.

The Long Island Bar is home to the best cocktail in the world. Truly. I mean it. I've been many times, grabbing a stool at the retro 1940s style bar, and each time the Dolores Del Rio blows my socks right off my feet.

This drink is not only pretty to look at but it makes my taste buds tingle. A mix of jalapeño infused tequila, cane syrup, aperol, lime juice and the best ingredient of all - passion fruit purée. It's spicy, tangy, sweet, and magical.

I've brought others to taste it too and they all agree - this cocktail is #1.

But I will say that I've tasted the Erin and Boulevardier and they are excellent too. These bartenders just know what they are doing.

FRIED CHEESE CURDS.

I'm sorry, did I just yell that? I rarely raise my voice, but nothing gets me in a tizzy like fried cheese. Even shittily fried shitty cheese is good, but rest assured that this is some of the finest fried cheese you can get. Do not ignore what I'm saying here. Drop whatever insignificant thing you happen to be doing, and stuff these into your facehole immediately.

To be quite honest, I would love any bar that has such excellent cheese curds even if they only served warm Corona sans lime, in lipstick covered glasses garnished with pubic hair (that's pretty high on my list of things I don't want to drink).

But this place...this place also happens to have some of the finest cocktails around. The Dolores Del Rio is my jam, and sipping that in their big, beautiful window while munching on fried cheese curds and watching the world go by...this is as good as life gets.

I think you're my new favorite bar, Long Island Bar. Thanks for being you.

This is my favorite spot in the area. Unreal drinks. Great staff. Comfy booths. No reason to go anywhere else. Ever. Can I move in?

One of the best burgers I've had. Long Island bar is a retro diner style restaurant. It fills pretty quickly because the food is so good, so I recommend reservations or being willing to wait. Their gin cocktail, Improved Pendennis, is absolutely delicious. It's hard to drink slow because it's so flavor full and goes down easy. As appetizers, we order the deviled eggs, which they master such a great classic. Then to eat, of course, the Long Island burger. The ladies' burger is a great option if you're not terribly hungry. Make sure you get a side of fries regardless. All in all great restaurant with cool retro vibes, delicious drinks and an amazing burger.

We came here on Easter Sunday prior to going to a brunch party. Maybe because of the timing, the place was pretty empty. The interior looks like an old school dinner, with couple of booths and rows of barstools along the bar. Bartender was very attentive and gave us water and drink menu right away. Unlike an old school dinner, they have a great selection of whisky and tequila, and not just the cheap ones. Right after I sat down, I spotted Yamazaki, as any whisky snob would know, Yamazaki is one of the world's top distilleries.

We got couple rounds of drinks, I like their take on bloody mary, instead of vodka, they have aquavit liquor in it. Normally I wouldn't like it because aquavit smells like black liquorice and I cannot stand black liquorice. But surprisingly the bloody tasted spicy and smoky and really yummy. And maybe we were one of those crazy customers started drinking around noon, they also gave us some complimentary torrijas, which tasted like a combination of French toast and churrios. Love love love.

So, yummy drinks, super friendly staff, I definitely will come back and try their brunch or dinner.

A true old school bar with great burgers being pushed out of its kitchen.  The double patty burger is topped with cheese and a fancy sauce. Aged flavor on the beef sets this guy apart from most double patties in the game.  The bar takes their cocktail game seriously so make sure you have a couple while you dig in.

One of the best cocktail bars in the known world. All of their house drinks are wonderful dance moves around ]drinks you already love. A complete night there includes the fried cheese curds and the burger. I mean, this burger is one of legend with an amazing house made cheese that melts like American but tastes of real funk. Come for an evening and enjoy yourself.

let's do the time warp again. hit this joint up for all the Art Deco vibes, good drinks and food, and the ability to deluxify your burger with a $100 bottle of champagne.

well, okay, we didn't get the champagne, but this place is still awesome.

small menu but solid picks. the stuffed chicken croquette with cheese, potato pave, and salad mustard vinaigrette hit the spot. the chicken was perfectly crunchy fried on the outer layer, gooey on the inside. I will also confirm that the french fries are excellent.

we joked about getting the fried cheese curds, but only one of us had done a half marathon that day and it wasn't me.

I got a hearty chuckle out of seeing the exact same model of thermostats that my parents and both sets of grandparents had their houses.

I've never had a scotch-and-soda with a shiso leaf in it until now, but it was quite tasty and added to the retro vibes. is that Don Draper in the corner?

Usually fairly crowded the few times I have gone on a weekend, but well worth the wait.  I can not stress to you enough how good the cheeseburger and fries are here.  Yes, simple cheeseburger and fries, no frills yet somehow executed to perfection.

Best burger in town in my opinion, and the drinks aren't too shabby either.

Decided to pick a neutral territory spot as I was coming from the south and my buddy lives north of here... so there we were.

I got The Erin cocktail, it might be my new favorite cocktail. When I told the bartender I didn't know what Suze and Bigallet were (and yes, I consider myself a professional alcoholic)... he was kind enough to give me small tastes.

The bartender was smart enough to semi-insist we get Cheese Curds to share... thank God he did and we listened! The batter was so light. So tasty. I would almost go back just for that.

I say almost, cause then our burgers came. This meat is very dry-agey-funky... if you don't like the funk... stay away... but my buddy and I? Weeee want the funk!!! :)

You could barely see the burger meat cause the melted cheese was overflowing all over it. A huge heap of very very solid, thin, crunchy fries made this one of the best burgers in NYC (probably my current favorite in Brooklyn).

When I think about going to a bar and grabbing a burger, this will be one of the top choices in my mind, which maybe a gross disservice to (what I'm sure are) other great things on the menu.

On a side note, there's a back room, with a giant TV. I happened to be sitting in front of it, and another patron asked to watch the NBA Playoffs. When they turned it on, I could barely talk to my dining partner in front of me, it was very distracting and kept giving me a headache.

To their credit, the staff asked my permission before turning it on first, seeing as I was sitting directly smack dab in front of it. AND they were nice enough to switch us to the bar when it was clearly giving me a headache... but I'm still trying to figure out why there's a TV that big in a room that small? (Or why there's a TV in a bar that is clearly trying to harken back to a time before TVs for that matter :).

Went on a Friday night, been wanting to come here since they reopened. A great touch by getting served carbonated water upon sitting down.  Had one drink. A gimlet. Love the decor. I can only think of how this place was back in the days when the hospital was around and the docks were booming . Lively crowd. Would love to go back.

This is a 'hidden classy gem'.

So far, I have been here twice and for me, this is one of the best burgers and most awesome old-school 'dives' I have ever been to!

The restaurant looks exactly how it did when it opened in the 1950's and both, the beverage menu as well as the food menu is awesome and the bartenders and the servers are SO nice.

They have the best Kölsch on tap that I ever had in the US (I am from Köln....), their fried cheese curds are to die for and the L.I. Burger taste FANTASTIC!

The Long Island Bar is a modern classic and every time someone asks me where to get the best Burger in NYC, I will take them here!

Keep it up Joel and Toby and thank you!

This place is an instant classic. I stumbled upon it while living in Brooklyn Heights because there just wasn't much else in the area, but over time, I couldn't stop thinking about it. The cocktails, though fiendishly overpriced, are simply the best around. You get the feeling that the bartenders are a bit pretentious and unattentive, but that's sort of the vibe of the place. Side note: It's super Instagram friendly, albeit a little dark. You can tell it's the place to be in a relatively quiet neighborhood.

A below mediocre experience. We ordered two cocktails (boulevardier and a gimlet) which were fine, prepared as they should have been.

The bartender with the glasses was terrible. He may have said three words to us, No, No, Yes.

One of the No's was in reference to "is trout a bony fish, I don't remember the last time I've had it"

Bartender shrugs "No"

First bite,of course it has a bone in it as well as the second bite. Fortunately those were the only bones but it made we want to get out of there as soon as possible.

I don't think it's fair to sweat a couple bones in the fish or maybe a surly bartender here and there. In this scenario it just seems like if the team isn't going to put in the effort why should we?

We went to clover club nearby and had a good experience to close out the night.

As a local in Boerum Hill, I've been a patron here a few times and have said nothing but amazing things about it. The decor, the food, the tunes, everything.

However last night while at the bar BOTH bartenders were incredibly rude and snooty. It was a Friday night and not busy, maybe 6 people at the bar total, and not only were my friend and I ignored, but when we asked for service the divas of the two wannabe machomen-yet-awkward bartenders acted like they couldn't be bothered with our presence. In fact, my friend and I left seething afterwards as if we were not welcome from the second we stepped in our own local establishment. I wanted to chew the bartenders both out for being so condescending and unfriendly. Don't be so smug just bc you're now in the newspaper as a top bar/restaurant in BK. News flash: it doesn't last. So disappointing, not going back. See you at Colonie or Chez Moi down the street, MUCH friendlier and inviting environments for locals.

Great dinner option for a first date. Dark, intimate bar setting, and an approachable menu.

Cheese curds. Everyone on Yelp! loves them because they're REALLY GOOD. If anything, order some drinks and get 1-2 order of curds. Nothing else!

"Dry Aged" Burger was recommended on Yelp!, but it has been really underwhelming both times. Meat was dry both times. Do not recommend.

Went here on a Sunday night with my boyfriend to unwind before the week starts. It had a surprising crowd. Felt like a Long Island bar (I'm originally from LI). The drink (Long Island gimlet) was good. My boyfriend felt that his were okay. Would come back.

Super unique, fun spot. The burger is incredible, as are the fried cheese curds. Cocktails were exceptional, and the staff is lovely. The gentleman who tended to our plates and waters, etc. was such a sweetheart and clearly loved his job. This to me is so telling of the establishment and how it's run. Great date spot or dinner with friends!
