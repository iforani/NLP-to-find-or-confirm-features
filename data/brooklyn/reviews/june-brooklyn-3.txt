Upon first glance, the menu at June seems limited - they are a wine bar, after all! We still decided to check it out, and oh my goodness, was it worth it!

First things first - if you plan to try any of their wines, definitely go for it! But be prepared to buy by the bottle. This came as a bit of a surprise to us - who wouldn't want to try multiple different wines? But in the end, we got a unique plum/apple cider and were very happy with our choice.

The ambience is very intimate. It's not a huge place and the tables are quite small. If you've got a larger group, there are a few tables for you all, but we would recommend a reservation to make sure you've got a spot! It's also extremely dark, so excuse our potato photo quality :)

The food was to die for. Oh my goodness, was it delicious! We ordered the Potato Croquettes, Koginut Squash, and Colorado Lamb Shank.

The Potato Croquettes were melt in your mouth delicious with an amazing spicy aioli to dip in! The aioli was just the right amount of spice to give the potatoes a nice kick.

The Koginut Squash was very fresh and had me feeling healthy! The dip it is laid in was herby and savory, and was very reminiscent of middle eastern/Indian tastes. To me, it felt like home.

The Colorado Lamb Shank was the highlight of our night - the lamb was so perfectly cooked, it was fall of the bone tender. It is laid in a Strawberry X.O. sauce, which surprised us, because it didn't taste sweet at all - which we were quite happy about! After chatting with the chef, we learned that the Strawberry X.O. is extremely dehydrated strawberries, such that the sweetness is eliminated, laid in the X.O. sauce which is very umami. It felt like we were eating a salad, due to all the hearty greens and goodness, but was still incredibly tasty and filling. We might have to make this dish a monthly thing!

To top off the night, we ordered the Honey Crisp Tart Tatin for dessert which was just the right amount of sweet. I'm a big dessert girl, but Ricardo isn't huge on the sweets, and yet he loved this! It wasn't too sweet to leave you dehydrated or overwhelmed but just the right amount to have you very satisfied. This dish comes with vanilla ice cream on the side, but be aware, this is more like a froyo (with the emphasis on the yogurt part), so if you're not a yogurt fan you may not enjoy that addition to your dish.

I have been super hesitant about outdoor dining, but June turned out to be the perfect spot to do so.

Masks are required when entering, but once you are seated in the garden area, you can remove yours. The outdoor seating exceeded my expectations. Tables were seated way more than 6 feet apart (THANK YOU!) which really calmed my worries. The space is also very nicely decorated, string lights and all. A sweet little oasis during these crazy weird times.

Of course, they are known for their natural wines so we had to give them a try. I tried both the red sparkling and orange sparkling. The red was much sweeter, but the orange really was my favorite. According to new regulations, if you order a drink, you also have to order food, but fear not! June has plenty of small dishes to safely share. We went with the Fig & Pecorino, as well as the Whipped Ricotta dip. Both matched really well with the sparkling wines that we ordered. If June had a more extensive dinner menu, we surely would have ordered more plates to try.

The staff wore masks at all times, and tables + chairs were thoroughly sanitized between customers (I saw this with my own eyes). They were also super friendly and made the experience so much nicer.

We liked our wines so much that we actually purchased (numerous) bottles to take with us. I can't wait to enjoy my new favorite wine at home!

Great outdoor seating in a cosy, romantic backyard patio.  I highly recommend the amazing ricotta spread and warm pita bread.

CUTE! CUTE! CUUUTE! We were seated inside, but the happy hour crowd started trickling out and we moved to the garden and boy am I glad we did! Noticed other parties did the same. The patio deck and garden seating made the entire experience.

When you order wine, they give you a swig first to make sure you're satisfied with your selection before pouring the entire glass. I chose a '17 rosé that wasn't too dry.

Now the food is GREAT, suuuuper fresh. There were like 6 figs halved in the stracciatella. Ricotta dip was really refreshing, tomatoes were bomb, and sliced baguette was crusty the way I love. I can also confirm the succotash and chicken plate were decent at the least, only because the older couple next to us looked so impressed as they ate their meals. Yes, the seating is elbow to elbow unless you've got a larger party- just a warning.

This isn't a 5 for me because desserts were confusing, plates are small (which I get, tapas = small, BUT for the price), and seating is tight.

June is a wonderful oasis of very cool, very interesting wine in a cozy location with great decor and an option for booths, bar seating and outdoor seating.

The wine list is really the reason to hit this place up.

What a great find!

Of all the places we could've chose from in the area, we are super glad we decided to walk in here. Without a reservation, our server was real nice and accommodated us quickly with a seat outside in their cute backyard area. The backyard is spacious and decorated nicely with a wood barn type feel and nice hanging wire lights above. If its nice out, I recommend getting an outdoor seat.

They serve tapas here mostly, so small plates to share. I speak for all of us when I say the ricotta dip got us friggin hooked! so good that we ordered a second one before we even finished the first. I'm not sure how that ricotta was that garlicky and creamy but it was to die for. The toasted/buttered sourdough was perfect for scooping copious amounts of ricotta as well. The Heirloom potatoes were also a big hit for us. Nicely cooked fingerling potatoes tossed in a creamy sauce and chunks of sautéed crispy pork belly. The charcuterie board was simple and delicious. My only comment was the eggplant. The sauce was great but the sesame and flakes on top didn't do well for me, great flavor tho.

The also have a nice assortment of cocktails and a huge variety of wines.  I got the Silk and Soul, really refreshing, and I highly recommend it!

Really great ambiance and rare natural wines on the menu. Good looking crowd. Amazing location. I will say, we had to order food due to the covid restrictions so we got olives. They tasted terrible! So maybe find a new supplier. Obviously no one comes for the olives but just saying.

What a slice of loveliness. The details are irreverently appointed. The music and energy is sophisticated, yet relaxing. I had a glass of white wine (pictured) that was the best glass of wine I've had since I was living in Paris. The salad was not boring and in fact had little surprises throughout. There is a quaint back patio. If I lived in this neighborhood I'm pretty sure this would be my living room as I'm sure it is for many. I will be back!

Super cozy wine bar with an incredibly helpful and friendly staff. The wines are all organic so they tend to be a little different from what you'd expect. With that said, both times I've gone the staff has helped navigate me to something new and delicious. Have not had a chance to eat here yet but their charcuterie looks delicious.

The perfect mix of classy and vintage, but still hip and modern. June is a great date spot, with dim mood lighting and a huge drinks menu (it is a wine bar after all).

I stopped in with a friend for drinks and apps. She ordered the Graft cider and I had the Lavender Fields cocktail, plus a charcuterie board to share. The charcuterie didn't include bread, but it could be added for an additional $1.50 (which I think is just a bit pointless). I would definitely recommend the charcuterie purely on deliciousness, not on price. It's $15 for a choice of two meats and $9 for one. Our two choices were divine and just enough for the two of us.

My friend enjoyed her cider and my drink was exactly what it claimed to be, extra lavender-y. It was a bit too syrupy for my taste and quite thick, but that helps you drink slower?? I would probably go for something else next time, but one drink miss wouldn't keep me from returning. Our server was very friendly, attentive, and willing to explain everything on the overly posh menu (another possibly off-putting element, but hey, talk the talk?).

The extensive menu allows for many return visits with new drinks to try every time and the gorgeous interior makes for a great backdrop. If you're looking to show off your refined tastes to a date or maybe even your parents, June is the place to go.

I wish I could brunch hard. You know, like multi cocktails and no worries hard. Instead, I have less opportunities to do breakfast at lunch time. So when I do, I want to be selective in my choice. June will not disappoint.

If I'm in a sweet craving for brunch you'll get a mixed bag of options for French Toast. Finding June's French Toast to be closer to a bread pudding soft style was a delight and just what I was looking for.

We got there early and had the place to ourselves. They have nice little booths inside and it's dimly lit and charming in an old world style way. Service was spot on and drinks came quickly and went down just as easily.

If you're in the hood and craving a laid back and low key vibe with excellent food check out June.

Great wine bar. They even serve fluffy deep fried potato balls! But the server in my pic is an ahole. He kept treating us like we weren't annunciating or speaking loudly enough. Trust me, I annunciate and am semi-loud. Go for the wine but don't let this dbag treat you like you're low-class or whatever the f he thinks you are.

Loved the ambiance here. Came on a Saturday while waiting two hours for table at Lucali. The waitress behind the bar was very friendly and helped us choose wine and taste it. At around 8 pm the tables and bar around us filled up. There's an outdoor space but it was closed for a party. It has an old school yet trendy vibe, good for a date. Prices on par with any NYC bar. The food looked good though we didn't order. Recommend!

This is a great spot to meet up with your friends for a casual evening out. The wine list is extensive (it is a wine bar after all), and the noms are decent. We tried Heirloom Potatoes (with Pork Belly and Butter Milk Dressing) , the Egg plant, 2 steaks, and the stracciatella. I would come back for the happy hour. It has a very cute outdoor space.

Great assortment of small plates, even now during COVID. We especially liked the one with summer squash, can't remember what it was called. Everything was clean, and service was friendly and efficient. I tried their sparkling orange wine on a whim, and it was pretty good. I was afraid it might be sweet, but it was nice and dry. Tastes like a dry cider. Overall very nice experience.

I loved June!  Located on Court Street, this is a very intimate, classy wine bar reminiscent of a French bistro, with wonderful creative cocktails and wine selection. The marble-top counter top bar is delicious to sit at and watch mixologist Nicola (a Venetian direct from Italy) shake up his famous "Venetian Sunset" cocktail.  He pours generously and is happy to share his "secret" recipe. The other staff are all warm, easy and friendly. My favorite bar in Brooklyn. Perfect place to pre-game for a night out, or just relax and enjoy a few too many Sunsets.

Came here today for brunch and it was different... there was no eggs Benedict or anything on the menu, i ordered the first item on the menu and it was a bowl of avocado and egg with mixed nuts over rice, it pretty much tasted like an everything bagel on rice... my friend got a salad with fish and I preferred mine better, the fish was a little too fishy for my personal preference but if you eat he whole dish together with the squash it balances everything out pretty well. They have a decent variety of teas and I believe we ordered the pi lo cha? It was good. The best part of the meal was probably the side of sour dough that we ordered. I did not like the grape jam but the bread was off the hook! It comes looking like French toast so don't be alarmed... we thought they gave us the wrong order at first

Had a fantastic birthday dinner here for my lady last night. It is a beautiful spot and special thanks to Ashley for accommodating our large group (10) in the somewhat private back room. We were very comfortable. We sampled a variety of selections from the smaller plates section of the menu as well as a few entrees and all agreed on how delicious and fresh the food was. The service was also above par. I was very impressed with our server Shannon. I am not used to the level of professionalism she displayed. Great drinks too! Thanks folks, we'll be back!

I am a bit of a wine geek.  I don't mind trying some different wines, reds especially, from different areas off the beaten track.  This wine list was made for me.  I had a Rhône Valley red from Magnum (special Thanksgiving week sharing and an Italian Nero.  Both of which were served at proper temperature, always a plus.  Offerings from Austria, Hungary, Georgia (the country not the state).   Deep offerings from areas not in Burgundy and Bordeaux, like Jura.   A very well thought out and curated list.  Appetizers are excellent.  Service was very attentive and friendly.  I might have a new favorite wine bar.   A definite must go to in Brooklyn.

Came here for a late brunch on a lazy Sunday after my archery session. The weather was hot yet beautiful outside.

June is a sexy little spot that takes you to a different world as soon as you walk in.  The inside was calm and cool with a soft buzz from all the patrons sitting at the bar.

The lighting was bright since it was day time, but all the booths lined up on the side gave the whole place a classic and relaxed feeling.  I would love to come see this spot again at night.

"Me and My Arrow" seemed like a nice fitting cocktail to start with, and also ordered the duck rice and crostini.  The cocktail was really well made; refreshing with strong citrus notes.

The duck rice had a deep flavor.  I would definitely order this again.  The salmon crostini was well balanced.  The smoked salmon and cream cheese with thick cut toast gave every bite a smooth and luscious texture.

All the plates were neatly presented and tasted fantastic.  Would recommend all of them.

I love this place, and have been here twice. The first time was on a cold winter night when I sat at the bar with a friend. We had some 'orange' wine (similar to rose) which I didn't even know existed. We also shared some small plates, all of which were delicious, including the mushrooms, brussels sprouts and a salad-all seasonal, light, fresh and definitely small yet satisfying.
I returned on a Friday night surprised at how empty it was and we scored a lovely booth. We had a bunch of drinks and it is just a beautiful pleasant atmosphere. Dark-romantic I suppose. I would bring a date here but totally fine and realizing for friends. They do close at 2am though.

I came here for Saturday brunch on a sunny Winter day and it was just lovely. We made reservations though Resy--not that we needed to. When we arrived it was only half full, which actually made for a very relaxed atmosphere. They have a little patio area at the back. In the winter, part of it is closed off, but you still have lots of light from the windows and can look outside.

The service was great. Everyone was super friendly. The coffee was delicious (and I'm pretty picky about coffee). For food I had the Frog in the Hole, which was a great size and extremely tasty. My friend had the Farro bowl, which he liked, but was a little small for someone with a big appetite.

I wish I lived closer so I could be a regular at this spot. I'll definitely be visiting again.

A very cozy and fun place that we were surprised to find in Cobble Hill.  It felt romantic and dim as soon as you walk in.  Staff was friendly and service was fast.

They have a large wine and drinks list.  The dishes have unique flavors and well prepared with top quality ingredient.  They have quite a number of French wines to choose from.  We opted for a bottle of Ruth Lewandowski Boaz that paired beautifully with the lamb breast.  Everything tasted great and we didn't want to leave the place.  Will come back for more...

This is such a wonderful spot to meet someone for a drink. It's charming and dimly lit for a casual but could-be-romantic vibe (definitely a great date spot), with great aesthetics.

The servers were attentive and quickly brought us menus. There's a large wine list (with glasses in the $9-$15 range) with a nice cocktail menu ($12-14) and draft/bottle beers/ciders. I'll admit, even at a wine bar, I ordered a cider because they had a new Graft that I had been wanting to try. My friend ordered the Lavender Fields cocktail which was lemony and lavender-y. It was subtle and quite delicious.

We also ordered the charcuterie with a side of bread (I recommend the side of bread, what they don't tell you is that it's buttered toast and perfectly crispy/soft). It was $15 for two meats and you get a decent amount. Overall, I would note that the menu is on the fancier side with prices a little higher.

A great, relaxing spot to meet a date or a friend. I will be back to try the wines and additional cocktails!

The food is delicious. The service and wine is wonderful. However, the AC is broken, so although we enjoyed everything, the experience was quite unbearable in over-90 degree weather. :/ I hope they fix it soon so we can go back!

June's interior is to-die-for cute. Character in every corner. It's a really great ambiance, I bet this place would be sweet for a night out with friends. However, I came here for a brunch and was unimpressed by the food. Nothing was great for me or the two people I came here with. I had the "frog in the hole" after asking the server for her recommendation and it seemed like something I could make at home... but it was lacking the homey feel. For what we got I also felt the price was too high. Nothing was bad and the services was friendly. Consider trying this place for ambiance and drinks, skip the food (at least the brunch).

June came highly recommended, but the drinks and the service/ambiance were just okay. The service was quite slow - including the process to be seated, receive a menu, and to flag someone down to order. There are many wine choices of course, but the server seemed impatient when I asked questions so I only picked what was familiar to me. I would come here again with friends but I found the indoor area to be a bit too loud for a date.

Excellent cocktails. Extensive wine list (with a few high quality beer choices as well). Gorgeous decor. Hospitable service. Best of all, they boast diverse and original small plates that range from quite good to absolutely outstanding, and they are, improbably, pretty reasonably priced.

In case you were wondering, we shared the slow baked carrots (solid, but the accompanying Roman gnocchi are stunning), the cassoulet (rich and delicious), the kale salad (it is Brooklyn, after all), the acorn squash flatbread (yes), and the brioche (fuck yes). And it was more than enough for dinner for two.

June may be new to the neighborhood, but as far as I can tell the only shortcomings seem to be that it should be at least four to five blocks closer to my apartment, and it's going to be tough to get a seat.

Beautiful spot for the intimate and romantic date that you seek.

They have great music and curiously more people willing to be seated at the bar than the table. The answer probably is the bartender makes some mean and fearful drinks.

This place offers tapa style dinner while the serving might be small but the flavor is top of the class. We love the lamb and hummus with bread. There are many many dishes to pick from however we suggest to order them one at the time as the table isn't really that big.

Seating is not an issue before 7:30PM however that's when most people started to enter. As online said no RSVP, that is not true. You should really call them and they will accommodate. Waiting staffs are wonderful and very very professional.

Great new wine and cocktail bar on Court street. It's in the old Van Horn space, and they did a wonderful job renovating the place. Love the lighting, the mirrors, and the bar. Very old school vibe. Kind of like a miniature train station.

Their wine menu is impressive. Very thorough, with lots of wine types I'd never even heard of before.

But I came here for the cocktails. At first I was skeptical because they only had 6 cocktails on the menu. But after tasting a few of them, I could tell that they put thought into crafting each one.

The Infinitely Late at Night was a brandy cocktail with rosemary and genepy. Very well balanced, and you could taste all of the ingredients. Strong but not overpowering. A bit on the sweeter side.

Also tried the Things Behind The Sun, which had gin, vermouth, besk, apricot and sour orange. Decidedly more tart than the Late at Night, but also very good.

The second best part of the cocktails is that each one has at least one ingredient I haven't had before. The first best part is that the cocktails are reasonably priced at $10-12 apiece.

Bartenders are great (and good looking, if you *must* objectify them). But most of all, they mix a mean cocktail. It seemed like they had 5 or 6 people behind the bar at once to fill all the orders, which made service super quick on a Friday night.

Great date spot too! Maybe cozy up to an indie movie at Cobble Hill Cinemas, grab some wine/small bites at June, and finish off the night at Chocolate Room? That would definitely get me into bed.

Looking to treat yourself, or have someone treat you? THIS IS THE PLACE!

Every bite melts in your mouth literally e v e r y bite of e v e r y dish this place serves up. The wine, without question, is fantastic.

Coming from someone with bizarre fermentation allergies who is usually allergic to most wines and vinegar... the wine here never gave me any reaction other than pure joy!

Nick the manager will help you above and beyond your needs with an amazing attitude and lovely demeanor.

June wine bar is a dream, even the bathroom is pretty.

One of my favorite neighborhood gems in Carroll Gardens. It has a really extensive wine list ranging from white to sparkling red or white.
It can be a bit tight so it's perfect for one on one time with a friend or a date. I love the food here. I usually get the bread & ricotta basket, turnips  and ham plate. I usually share the trout and get the olive cake for dessert. I love that it's alot of vegetable plates and they are really tasty and I don't feel guilty when I leave.

Went at 11am on a Sunday when it opens - no crowds and got the quiet backyard to ourselves. Cute space. Our server was so friendly. We went with her recommendations - savory bread pudding with ham, tomatillo and egg; frog in a hole with Shitake mushrooms. Got a side of slab bacon to share.

The bread pudding was so unique and delicious. Savory and soft with ham inside the pudding, and tangy tomatillo adds a ton of flavor to it. The frog in the hole was good - I enjoyed the mushrooms and the soft center of the egg. But it wasn't super flavorful/didn't stand out to me as much. The bacon was very well cooked.

I love how they have a short, seasonal menu. All the more incentive to go back and try other dishes before they are gone. Wasn't blown away but definitely one of my favorite neighborhood brunch places overall.
