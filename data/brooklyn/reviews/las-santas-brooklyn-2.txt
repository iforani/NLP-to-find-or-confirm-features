Vicente is a very caring and attentive server. He took great care of us even during Covid regulations. The mood and food were all amazing and consistent. Beautiful food on a tranquil Brooklyn city corner. Definitely recommend the shisito peppers and and corn! Love!! It's a whole vibe!

I cam here with my friend the other day (during covid). The drinks were really good, even over flowing. I had a mango margaritas which was really tasty along with the steak tacos. The service was amazing, we got seated right away and the tables were safely distanced. I loved how you have to scan a qr code to receive the menu so you aren't touching menus that have been touched. Also the staff gladly replaced my drink after a fly flew into it . I will definitely be coming back for more margaritas and tacos.

I'm so glad this place opened after quarantine. It is a great spot for delicious Mexican food and cocktails. 100% recommend churros for dessert. Our waiter's name was Vicente, a very pleasant person who provided great service and made sure all of our food needs were met. Definitely will be back!

We had the most amazing happy hour experience. Thank you to Vicente who made our Monday night not just a happy hour but an experience... we came on a whim and left elated. The outdoor seating was dreamy!

The drinks were fantastic, and Vicente adjusted them after the first round just how we wanted them. The food was delicious, and the conversation was next level. Will definitely be back...probably this week!!  If you can ask for Vicente, you won't be sorry!

I really enjoyed this place while my boyfriend did not so that's why the lower score for this spot.

We came on a Saturday night around 8 PM and there were plenty of tables open. I like the atmosphere of this place-  it had nice big open windows for outdoor seating and plenty of space to keep everyone distanced which was great.
When we arrived they were playing really great music that fit the vibe but then as the night got later they started playing generic pop music which ... I love ... but it made the restaurant feel less authentic and more try hard. If I'm at a Mexican restaurant I don't need to hear The Black Eyed Peas blasting through the speakers while I eat my dinner ... but I digress ...

I ordered a margarita which was fine. I wanted to get a frozen strawberry margarita but every additional change to a "regular margarita" was a $2 upcharge. it would've been $14 for a strawberry marg which felt excessive to me, but my boyfriend and I agreed that it's normal pricing for New York ... just felt kinda ridiculous so I stuck with a regular marg instead.

I ordered the chicken fajitas and my boyfriend got the special that evening which was snapper with a side of rice and beans. He did not enjoy his meal at all - it wasn't anything special or exciting and felt bland for being a "special" he said it felt barely seasoned. The chicken fajitas were excellent - and the veggies were probably the best part- they were perfectly roasted and very flavorful - I honestly liked the veggies more than I liked the chicken. We ordered the churros for dessert and they were wonderful.

My only other beef with this place comes at the end. We asked our waiter for the check and waited about 20 minutes - he never came back. He kept tending to another table of his with two young pretty girls and never once came back to check on us. He spent a lot of time flirting and chatting with them and completely forgot about our check. We then asked one of the bus boys who apologized and left seemingly to go tell our waiter .... another 20 minutes go by and still no check. I kept trying to get our waiters attention but he would not even look over at us. Finally after waiting 45 minutes for our check we got ahold of another waiter who wound up bringing it over for us. This reason alone made me not want to return because it just got really frustrating - especially because we wanted to leave. I'd come back here to have a drink with a friend or maybe for more of the veggies but the lack of focus from our waiter was a huge problem for me - no one should wait 45 minutes and have to ask 4 times in order to pay....if you don't want my money, I won't wait around next time.

If i could give this a 0 i would, the guac was cold and had no flavor, the shrimp tostada also had no flavor, the steak quesadilla was similar to a deli quesadilla, honestly you can't mess a quesadilla up but they did anyway. The enchiladas were 22 dollars and came with just the enchiladas which did i mention that they also sucked? Yea well they did I'm baffled at how this place has almost 5 stars I've had some delicious Mexican cuisine and then there's this a completely mediocre excuse to overcharge people. Chelas in park slope is 50x better than this, do yourself a favor don't come here.

Thai place opened up a few months ago and we've been wanting to check it out for awhile now so we went last Friday. Its a super cool chill spot for drinks and food.

The atmosphere had a very loung like vibe. It was dark and they had some good Spanish music playing. People were friendly and fairly quick. The decor looked to be very chill and relax.

Food was excellent. I didn't order too much besides the nachos and side of plantain but it was very tasty. The drinks were strong as well. They have so many variations of tequila there

Wow! What a pleasant surprise!
I chose Las Santas based on the Yelp reviews and proximity to the BAM Harvey Theater.

I didn't expect to be so wowed by:

A brilliant whole grilled branzino -- not on the menu, but possibly the most perfectly cooked and seasoned whole fish I've ever had in a New York restaurant. It was dynamite and a great value at $28.

A fabulous perfectly cooked plate of fajitas generous with a variety of smoky grilled vegetables and fresh homemade tortillas.

Delicious, potent, nicely balanced cocktails.

I can't wait to come back.

Photo of Las Santas - Brooklyn, NY, United States. Not on the menu, but glad I asked about the fish! The whole branzino is the most perfectly cooked and seasoned whole fish I&#39;ve eaten in NYC.

Upscale, trendy Mexican with surprisingly large menu. Pozole soup was thin and unfortunately lacked flavor. The rest of my party seemed generally underwhelmed by their entrees but my tuna tostada was actually quite tasty. The Mezcal margarita was delicious.
Decor is beautiful and restaurant sits in a generally great location. Service was also friendly.
Honestly, I think they need to jack up the flavor level to create returning customers.

Yum!

We are so glad that Las Santas opened in Brooklyn. Food was delicious and the drinks really shined. We loved the mezcal cocktail (la suegas?)

We started with the guacamole which was chunky and flavorful, served with homemade chips and salsa. Add the chiccharron and you won't be disappointed. It was amazing

We also had the shisito peppers with corn which we loved

For entrees I highly recommend the shrimp enchiladas - the flavors blended very well

The only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the ribs. It fell off the bone and was good but flavors were much more mild compared to the other dishes

For dessert we had  the churros which was the perfect ending to the meal

Yes yes yes. This place is beautiful inside, has great service, and delicious food and drinks. I really couldn't ask for more. The aesthetics in here were really hip. They have a bar area along with a big and beautiful restaurant space in back, complete with an open kitchen.

$9 MARGARITAS. Yah, you read that right. I got the guava margarita and it was perfection - not too sweet, and all fresh ingredients.

To eat, we got the ribeye chicharon guacamole, fish tacos, chicken fajitas, and shrimp enchiladas. The enchiladas come with a really impressive spread of mixed vegetables, delicious crema, and rice & beans. The shrimp enchiladas are delicious... but you must love creamy things to enjoy that dish! To scale, the fish tacos are smaller than the other entrees (and half the price), but they were probably my favorite bite of the evening - and I've sampled a lot of fish tacos.

One of my favorite things is that they mixed purple corn tortilla dough with white corn tortilla dough and that made these beautiful tie dye tortillas which also tasted fab.

We finished with the key lime pie which was very tasty. I highly highly recommend this place to anyone who lives in the area! It's definitely going to become my new neighborhood go to.

Came here on a Saturday night, with no reservation and we sat down right away. There wasn't many people inside either.

Right when you walk in, you are greeted by a hostess and to the left is the a bar with small tables. We decided to sit inside, which was fairly big and roomy.

The interior is super cute, with white/ grey decor. They have an open kitchen concept which I really do love.

Our waitress was super sweet, and attentive.

We ordered their guacamole to start and it was DELICIOUS, it was so freshly and chunky.. exactly how I like my guacamole. They also give you chips and salsa right when you sit. Plus for me ;)

For dinner, we both ordered their steak fajitas. It was really good, the veggies were seasoned so good, it came with a side of rice and beans and it was the perfect amount.

One thing I do have to say, we ordered our steak Medium and it was wayyyyy overcooked. It was very hard to chew and bite into, especially while eating it with the tortilla and everything else.

Overall great food and experience but I don't think I would be back.

We really enjoyed our meal at Las Santas, but nothing completely blew us away.  The drinks were solid and reasonably priced, though we found them all to be a bit too sweet (tried all margaritas and a few specialty drinks).  For using fresh citrus (according to the menu), it seems a waste to make it sweet enough that it's hard to discern the acidity of the fresh citrus.  I really enjoyed the Michelada, a really good version of it.

For food, the Guac and Queso Fondido were both really enjoyable.  We were running out of chips *constantly*.  It's weird to only get enough chips served to finish 1/4 of the guac or cheese, I realize they're doing so to keep their chip serving dish really nice looking, but I'd rather have an uglier serving dish and reasonable amounts of chips with my not-cheap guac and queso.

The mains were all satisfying though not electrifying.  I got the fish tacos and the chorizo&potato tacos, the fish tacos were definitely less impressive though good.  The chorizo and potato tacos were really good, I'd definitely get those again.

Service was really really good, everyone was super nice and attentive.  You got the feeling they really cared about you having a good experience.  The kitchen took way too long to get mains out, though everything was hot when it came out, so it could have been much worse.

We'll likely be back whenever we're interested in staying in the hood but getting really solid mexican food and cocktails.

A friend and I tried this spot out on a Friday night before heading to a Brooklyn Nets game. I really enjoyed the vibes of this place. Large restaurant, open kitchen, dimly lit, and noise levels were perfect to have a conversation without yelling. Perhaps it was the heat from the open kitchen, but it was incredibly hot inside the night we went.

One con was the chips and salsa. Usually these are complimentary but they charge $3 and granted the portions are not that big. Expect to order more than one if you're a chips and salsa person.

We both tried the guava and mango margaritas. These were 5/5! Not too sweet and not too strong. The fresh mango and guava juice was also a nice touch.

I got the chicken in adobo sauce tacos with a side of rice and beans. While the meal itself didn't blow me away, it was very good. The chicken was cooked nicely and the presentation was solid.

The service was also excellent! The staff was very attentive and quick to our needs, especially for it being a Friday night.

If im in the area again and I'm craving Mexican food, I'd definitely stop back!

There are very few Mexican restaurants I can call exceptional in Brooklyn and this is by far one of the top! The food is not only so colorful and beautiful but it's delicious. Aside from the amazing happy hour which gives you three mini tacos and a MARGARITA, beer or wine for $15 (you can also get mini empanadas) the margarita is the true star! I love margaritas and I highly recommend you give this one a try. One of the best margaritas I've ever had ! It hit the spot. The vegetarian tacos were delicious charred broccoli, colorful presentation I couldn't ask for more. If you are not into happy hour the regular menu is also filled with options. My friend got the chicken tacos and said it's one of the best he's ever had. Everything is very CLEAN. Waiters are wearing gloves and a mask. They even offer a way for you to pay with your phone so waiters don't have to touch your credit card. Outdoor seating is great and everyone has a safe distance away. I can not recommend coming here enough. One of my top Mexican spots in Brooklyn. Get the guacamole!!

Plenty of outdoor seating! It was packed on a weds for tiki night. Music is lively, Service is awesome and food came quick. Staff wears masks and gloves. The bathroom has a push door so no need to touch any door handles! I brought my little pup who sat quietly under our table and they were cool about it. The drinks are strong and tasty. I got the mango island (Rum base) and he got the sharknado (whiskey based drink). I'll be trying the pina colada next time since I see a lot of people ordering that with their meal. The corn and peppers are YUM. Guacamole portion is a bit on the smaller side but still tasty. The soup is FAB. Will definitely get that again especially as it gets chillier through the months. The tacos come with 2 in a order which is perfect for me since I can never finish 3 plus all the apps! Fish taco is . Not overly fried. Fish is flaky and not too much breading. The carnitas taco is heavier but good; with a lot of meat and fried pork rinds on top for a nice crunch! Flan is good but on the richer side. I'll try the churros next time. So glad this place is a short walk from our apt!

Tried this place on a Sunday and it wasn't crowded at all. I ordered the steak fajitas with a side of guac and a spicy margarita. The steak was good but the rice was undercooked and the beans lacked in flavor(could've just been the cook for the day). My margarita however, was amazing! My server was awesome and attentive.

The food was delicious, but the impeccable service made it all that much better. From the moment we walked in - whether it was someone taking off our coats and bags and hanging them for us, or proactively replacing our order after a mishap in the kitchen, we felt truly taken care of during our time there and def would go back anytime!

Went here last Friday for drinks, with the thought that they had a great happy hour. Unfortunately we were told there's no happy hour on Friday, wish that was indicated on the site. Me and my friend ended up getting margaritas (mango and guava). The guava was better. Both of the drinks were great. Not too sweet and you could taste the tequilla. We then also had the queso fundido which was pretty good.  It was served with tortillas (3) which is interesting, but we were able to finish it off with the chips that we were served with prior. Me and my friend weren't extreme fans of the salsa that was served with the chips, didn't feel tomato based.

The inside decor is super nice and cozy and there's plenty of space. Def will come back to try the entrees.

4.5 stars - really exceeded our expectations!

The ambience here is really nice and would be cute for a date night or dinner with friends. The bar area is perfect for watching a game; not cramped at all. We were really impressed by the list of $9 classic cocktails - Las Santas does NOT skimp on the liquor at all! These were STRONG and not watered down. Loved the mango margarita and the Paloma.

Food portions here are also super generous. My husband ordered the Pollo Borracho and I ordered the steak fajitas. Both had superb flavor and my steak was cooked perfectly. We even had enough to bring back a little something for our pup :) our only complaint is that the rice was a bit undercooked - kind of dry and clumpy. Otherwise everything was delicious.

We also loved the complementary tortilla chips and salsa, which tasted really fresh. Service here is fast and very friendly. We will definitely be back!

Stopped in after a Nets game for a couple of drinks and some food.   The place was pretty empty when we arrived.  Got seated  in the front by the window.  Ordered our drinks + some queso fundido & chips & salsa + 2 orders of tacos.  Then our waitress disappeared.

We had food runners bring our food & drinks.  Nobody ever stopped back ever to ask how things were.  We sat with empty drinks for nearly 20 minutes....  then had to flag someone down for our check.

Food was average, nothing worth coming back for.  Salsa from 'chips & salsa' was so tiny I thought it was a joke.   The vibe is cool - but service leaves lots to be desired.

My friend and I decided to check out Las Santas around 9:30pm on a Saturday due to the glowing Yelp reviews.  Maybe it was because it was a holiday weekend, but we luckily found parking next to the restaurant!  Also, the restaurant was not busy at all, which surprised me for a Saturday night.  The ambiance is classy, but the music was way too loud, in my opinion.  I feel like the music can be louder near the bar, but should be set at a level that allows people to hear conversation in the dining room area.

We started with a guava margarita and habanero margarita ($9/each).  If you're like me, and don't drink a lot, don't fall for the reviews about the guava margarita.  All I could taste was the tequila, but my friend said that he could taste the guava flavor.  The habanero margarita was much more refreshing than the guava margarita to me, and the kick was there but not overwhelming.  Anyway, I made the mistake of taking a sip of the margarita before the food arrived (which took a long time), so it made me sick so the rest of my review may not be as accurate.  We ordered the nachos ($12), which our server told us was HUGE.  I definitely wouldn't say huge, but if you were craving a lighter meal, the nachos could probably serve as an entree for one person, but it was a good sharing size for 2 as an appetizer.  The flavors were delicious, I just wished the chips were a little less crunchy, as my jaw started getting sore toward the end.  We then ordered steak tacos ($14) and fish tacos ($13).  I was disappointed by both the portion size and flavors of these tacos, especially for the price.  The toppings on the fish taco didn't really complement the fish and the fish itself did not have standout flavor.  My friend said that the steak tacos were decent, but also lacking in size for the price.

I read other reviews that raved about the service, but the service was awful.  Maybe if you come later at night when things are winding down, service gets worse.  It took a while for someone to greet/take our order (10+ minutes), for the food to come (30+ minutes), and there was no water refilling or any check backs once the food came.  Overall, I do admit that feeling sick affected how I felt about things, but except for the nachos, nothing really impressed me as a standout compared to other Mexican restaurants in the area.

Love Mexican food ?? Me too' can't go wrong  with Las Santa's .. i love the ambiance , it was lunch time so it was a cool vibe . The window seating  is great , drenched with natural sunlight , the bar has a wide variety of liquor . Our waiter  name was "Andre " he was a darling ! The food was great ! Parking is limited because of the busy down town traffic . But  the food is definitely  worth your while , i feel like this  place can  be family and kid friendly ! GOT MY VOTE

Such an amazing find!! Came here for happy hour after work on Friday! The space is amazing as the restaurant has an indoor/ outdoor feel and also tables outside. Happy hour ends at 6pm and they have great (somewhat small) margarita specials. My husband and I also both ordered the chicken tacos which were so delicious. We ended up ordering their entree size once happy hour was over since we really loved it. We also had chips and guacamole for the table. Great scene! It was pretty packed so the waiter didn't come around as often as I would have liked but what can ya do? Highly recommend this place.

572 Fulton has been plagued with constant turnover of restaurants. A previous installment (Lady's) promised authentic Latin cuisine but ultimately fell short of its lofty goals.

Now, finally I hope Las Santas is here to stay as we finally have an establishment that delivers on all that it promises and more.

Coming into the restaurant, the storefront is deceptively small as the entryway opens into a large foyer. Modern Spanish is the name of the game here as perfectly placed lighting installments and a full open kitchen grace the dining room.

The menu offers variety without being too cluttered with a plethora of small eats and group plates.

Starting with the guacamole, it seemed fresh with ample chunks of avocado (no browning thus the freshness). Chips refilled upon request. The seafood campechana was a recommendation from our server and for the price point gave significant portions of seafood.

Some highlights I would point out are the Pork Ribs (braised and fell off the bone), the whole fish (fish is carted in daily), the tequila infused half chicken.

Our server, David was extremely knowledge and attentive.  Some things I would note is that when requesting for the WiFi, even though it was noted as available, the servers weren't familiar. I'd attribute this to recent opening kinks that need to be worked out.

Go for the food, stay for the value. 5/5

Everything about this new Mexican place is amazing. First of all, the bartender, Gabriel, is the best! Super friendly and great mixologist. Amazing food, super cool glassware for the drinks as well as dishware for the food. Super cool open kitchen concept; the flan is served as bite-sized pieces with a piece of popcorn on top that doesnt seem exciting until you put it into your mouth. Wow. What a perfect balance. All around good place!
