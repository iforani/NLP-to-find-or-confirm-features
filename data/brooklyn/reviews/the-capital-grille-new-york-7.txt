It was great to be able to dine inside at Capital Grille again.  We had taken out from them since the pandemic began but ventured back in for the first time for dinner on an early Saturday evening.

What we noticed immediately was that the tables being used were nicely separated for social distancing. We felt very comfortable eating indoors there, probably more so than any other restaurant that we could think of.

As for the food, our favorite steak, the porcini rubbed ribeye with balsamic was as good as ever. The lamb chops were also excellent.

The service was also terrific. Brett, who has been our server in past visits also, was again friendly and helpful.

Hope to be back soon!

Went back to The Capital Grille - Wall Street on a Saturday evening and it was relatively quiet in the restaurant. Had a burger from the Wagyu and Wine menu and it was terrific. Great burger and great promotion!  Brett our server was also very friendly and helpful.  Will definitely be back.

The Delmonico Steak here is arguably among one of the best steaks that I have ever had (and I have been to many steakhouses: Sparks, Palm, Peter Lugers, Morton's, Wolfgang's, Del Frisco's, Ruth's Chris, etc) - the flavor is simply amazing. The Lobster and Crab Cakes Appetizer and the Flourless Chocolate Expresso Cake Dessert were also excellent. What impressed me more in my most recent visit (3/3/2012) though was the service that we received. When my wife commented to the waiter that she was cold, he promptly adjusted the air conditioning. My wife was also having problems with one of her knees and the manager who walks around the restaurant checking on the customers graciously asked if there was anything he could do to help.  After we had left the restaurant, the manager saw through the restaurant windows that my wife was hobbling down the street and he rushed out of the restaurant asking if he could help call us a taxi. Now that is customer service.

So it's Covid-19 and I need to treat my wife cause she's been cooking for weeks. Cooking is not my forte. Fact is: I don't have many options. But what I do have is The Capital Grille. Amazing chefs, fantastic food, trusted delivery. If you're in the FiDi area, I suggest treating your lady. Everybody wins.

My office is right down the block and I used to dine here all the time for business lunch and after work for about 8years before COVID. Impeccable service and amazing food. Always made reservations and never had to wait more than 5min to be seated. Every single staff here is well trained and very polished. Everything I've tried on the menu was delicious. Great food and dining experience guaranteed! You just can't go wrong with this place. It's my favorite place in financial district!

I had a reservation for a party of 4 in celebration of my birthday wth friends. I've eaten at capital grille before at a different location and even though it's a steakhouse and I'm meat free I wanted to make sure the meat lovers had a great time. I settled for the crab cakes and salmon and everyone else had the filet mignon, Brussels sprout , mashed potatoes and lamb
Ashley was our server and she was excellent. She kept the drinks rolling in and made sure we were all good .
My guests all had a wonderful time and enjoyed their food . Service was excellent , pricey but worth every penny. Loved it ! Second time around and I've been pleased with the service and happy that I shared  the experience  with friends

NYC Winter 2020 Restaurant Week (RW) Lunch review

I came here yesterday with 11 other colleagues for RW lunch. Reservations were easy to make thanks to OpenTable app. We were given a private room since there were so many of us and it was pretty nice to have a room to ourselves. So for RW lunch, you had to pick an appetizer and entree which costs $26 without tax & tips. Some colleagues ordered drinks (i.e soda or iced tea) that was $4.25 each for themselves.

I ordered the Caesar salad for appetizer.
The salad was fresh and delicious. For entree, I ordered the roasted chicken and it comes with mushroom parmesan risotto. There also some chopped up pieces of asparagus in the risotto as well. This dish was super filling and I didn't expect that there would be two big pieces of chicken breasts. I definitely enjoyed my meal. I was so full and I took some of my leftovers home.

Service was good. Our waitress was very friendly and nice. Although, it took awhile to get our entrees. At least everyone's food came out all at once. Overall, definitely come to Capital Grille for RW and take advantage of RW menu offerings!

I realize this place is part of a chain, but they do a really great job. I went last night to celebrate my own birthday and all the staff was so accommodating, addresssd me by name from the start, and just treated me first class the whole way.

I had a half dozen oysters with a cocktail. They were very fresh and briney.  Then the porcini rubbed bone in ribeye with a half order of creamed spinach. The steak was cooked perfectly.  They provided a birthday desert that included a flourless chocolate thing that was really great.

I truly appreciate being treated like a VIP and will totally come back.

Every Valentines Day we do a steakhouse. This year, we chose the Capital Grille, Fidi edition. We had easily the best table in the restaurant. It was upstairs, in a private little room, overlooking the rest of the restaurant. Had a round of martinis to start which were excellent. We ordered a bunch of appetizers for the table to share. The lobster Mac and cheese, crab cocktail, oysters and the spicy calamari. All were great but the lobster Mac was the winner of this round. Big pieces of lobster always makes it great. For my entree I had the Bone in Kona which was cooked perfectly and an amazing piece of meat. Add on sides of truffle fries, creamed spinach and mashed potatoes? A perfect meal.

This was one of the discreet restaurants by my office that I knew was very upscale and I really wanted to try someday. Thank goodness for restaurant week. $26 (before tax and gratuity) 2 course lunch menu  special woot woot !
Ambience: very regal  (we reserved for 12 people so we got a private room). The bathroom was very clean and had a full length mirror.
Service: excellent! The waiters were coming around frequently to assist us with anything we needed.
Food:
For the starter, I went with the new England clam chowder. To be honest, it just tasted like glorified hale and hearty soup. There's only so much you can do with clam chowder.
For the main course, I had the seared salmon. It was really good except I didn't understand why it didn't come with pilaf or some sort of side dish. I'm certainly not used to eating salmon on its own. Overall I like the texture and it wasn't dry.
Soft drinks were 4.25 each (rolls eyes)

Overall I'm glad I had a chance to finally experience this restaurant.

I finally got the chance to experience restaurant week and picked the best place to start - The Capital Grille. The restaurant was beautiful, elegant and classic. In the historic Equitable Building, what was once a mighty bank vault is now the entrance to the private dinning rooms on the lower level. Just stunning, don't forget to check it out.

For starters we ordered the Clam Chowder and Green Salad w/ Parmesan vinaigrette. The clam chowder was soft, creamy and had a substantial amount of clam in each bite. Now, I'm a fan of green salads but this had to be the best salad dressing I've ever had. I loveeeee Parmesan cheese and the vinaigrette was exactly what I was hoping it would be. I ate every single bite of the salad and really could gone for more.

We ordered a Blackberry Bourbon cocktail and an Old Fashion. The blackberry  bourbon drink was delish, just the right blend to accompany the mouth watering steak.
We ordered just about the same thing, the Bone-In Dry Aged NY Strip 14oz, one with lobster, one with jumbo shrimp and both with mashed potatoes. The mashed potatoes were just melt in your mouth creamy. It was such a great side to the steak. He ordered his steak medium and mine medium - rare. When they arrived to the table his steak wasn't cooked to his liking and the waiter Donavon noticed by the look on his face. Donavan asked him if he wanted to order another steak to his exact liking, he hesitated for a bit but then went with Donavon's suggestion to "eat the steak exactly the way you want it." Moments later Donavan returned with a steak cooked medium- rare that was exactly how he wanted. Thank goodness Donavan asked him a couple of times because it was really worth the extra little wait. I genuinely appreciated Donavan's attention to detail and vibe. Donavan was just a delight, exceptional service, fun and very helpful.  His service was 10/10.

Oh and just when we thought we were done, the desserts arrived. Hello chocolate cakes! First bite into the cake and I knew this was the right decision. The cake was served with raspberries on the side which allowed for a wonderful blend of sweetness from the cake and a bit of tartness from the raspberry. I really didn't have enough space to finish the entire cake but I did my absolute best.
I highly recommend this location we had a wonderful dining experience and can't wait to comeback.

I've been to this restaurant several times for lunch in the past and each time was great in every way. How can anyone top this?... by going there for lunch during restaurant week! My party of three ordered the pan seared salmon, roasted chicken breast and the signature cheese burger from their set menu. Our appetizers were the Field Greens Salad with Parmesan Vinaigrette and the New England Clam Chowder. Everything was delicious although the lack of side vegetables for the salmon and missing garnish for the burger was noticed when compared to my previous restaurant week dining last year.

If you want the absolute best Ribeye steak sandwich you have to go to one of the Capital Grille locations. The steak is literally cooked to perfection - medium rare! The French loaf looks like it will be very hard to bite into until you actually do and it's that flawless crunch on the outside with the soft breading on the inside. Also, it comes with a pairing of caramelized onions and havatri cheese that finish off this amazing combo!
The sandwich also comes with Parmesan truffle fries! Now, I am not a huge fan when the fries are loaded with truffles and parmesan, but at The Capital Grille they use just the right amount of seasoning! Waiter and waitresses are very welcoming and want to make your experience very enjoyable. One caveat, this meal is only served at lunch, not dinner. Their dinner menu is great but I like lunch time because it's a little cheaper for us frugal folk.

Always been a big fan of Capital Grille and been to several different locations. This was my first time to this location and I met a few friends after work. We visited because it was restaurant week. I ordered the field greens for a starter, grilled chicken with mushroom risotto and creme brulee for dessert. Everything was great. I know it was pretty busy so the service was a little slow. But our servers were very nice and welcoming.

My Aussie friend and I decided to come to this location for lunch since we went to midtown location the week before. I told her Hubby and I have been to midtown location for anniversary, the one in NJ for birthdays and the one in Garden City too. So yes, we are Capital Grille enjoyers! After introducing this restaurant to my Aussie friend, she loved it a lot, so, that's why we're here again.

I enjoy coming here because of the warm welcome from  professional staff plus the good meals. We had Tim as our waiter that afternoon. He was very good. We ordered two types of filet mignon. My friend ordered the 10 oz steak entree and I had from the lunch menu the 8 oz filet mignon. My sliced filet mignon served with the mushroom and her whole filet mignon came alone but we ordered a side of grilled asparagus. First they gave me a whole piece like hers, which we immediately knew it wasn't from the lunch menu and we mentioned to our waiter and without any hesitation he took care of it right away. It might have been a miscommunication because my friend ordered the regular entree filet mignon. This is what I love about coming here because the entire operation is a problem-free environment where the staffers were trained very well how to handle the customers. I must say that everything was excellent! I had salmon the week before at their midtown location. That too was amazing! Just check my salmon photo from midtown location. At the end, we were both satisfied with the meals and ready to explore NY again. Believe it or not the next day my friend is ready for another filet mignon! No way, I said.

The restaurant, the food, the ambience and the staff were excellent! I would go back in a heartbeat.

I came here the other night to celebrate a birthday dinner and we had a great time. The food and drinks were delicious you won't leave here hungry; we did have to send the steaks back 2x to get it at the right temperature we ordered medium well and we received medium rare. They even gifted us with a complimentary birthday dessert. We even took a little time to visit the famous vault downstairs- overall it was a good experience.

Came here with friends for Restaurant Week.
This was my second time at a Capital Grille, my first time was at the Garden City location and I've been craving it ever since, so when I saw that they were participating in restaurant week I knew that I had to go.

We came at our reservation time and were seated promptly by the hostess. Our server was great and very attentive the whole time.

For apps, we ordered the clam chowder and salad, both of which were pretty tasty. For entrees, two of us ordered the ribeye with green beans and one of my friends ordered the filet mignon, (which were all cooked to perfection) with mashed potatoes and we all shared an order of the lobster Mac & cheese, which is mouth-watering. For dessert we all got the cheesecake which was the best cheesecake I've ever had. I think it's safe to say that we all thoroughly enjoyed our meals.

I can't wait to go back again! Even if it's just for the cheesecake!

This was my first time here and we came to celebrate a friend's birthday. We we're running late but the staff was still kind and courteous. On the table was a birthday card and birthday confetti, It was so sweet and thoughtful I had no idea the staff would do this.

The waiter was very kind to give us plenty of time to select our appetizers and entree.

We ordered Hennessy sidecar which was very good. The calamari was light and crispy but salty and the lobster crab cake was perfectly delicious and portion size was good for one person.

I ordered the scallops with risotto; AMAZING! The scallops melted in my mouth and the risotto was divinely cooked and seasoned well.

When I have heard of Capital Grille it seems synonymous with high end service and food. Ifoe an appetizer I had the tuna tartare with avocado and crisp bread. Delicious with the only exception of mentioning mango in the description with only a small bit in the sauce. I was expecting more to layer the flavors. For the main course I had the dry aged steak au poivre which was perfectly encrusted with an absolutely deliciously buttery sauce that was wonderful to savor. Brussel sprouts perfectly cooked and wonderfully charred. And I was too full for dessert. And brought home enough for a second meal.
My only disappointment was that our drink glasses were dirty when wine was poured in. They were replaced and comped.  And also our orders got mixed up and the guest of honor did not get what she ordered. Again this was perfectly corrected with the expected apologizing.
The atmosphere is reminded me of someplace I would go to after a fox hunt  with a few dead animal heads on the walls. As the evening went on and the light started to fade the lighting got darker. Almost a bit too dark for a business dinner.
Price is what I would expect at a high end steak house  if I could give half stars this would be four and a half.

I have to say, I understand the time that we are in but I am not fan of this outdoor dinning. The tables are right in the sidewalk people are walking right pass you looking at you, I was not fan of it. Beside that the food was good they have special menu they don't have there full menu just so you know. The staff was great and super nice.

I have stopped eating here for lunch because I feel that they are too busy during lunch and the quality of the food suffers as a result. I recently went for restaurant week and I ordered a medium rare burger. The burger came well done. I didn't send it back, because everyone else got their food and I didn't want to wait for the time it would take another burger to be cooked.
On the other hand, their dinner is nice and good quality cuts on the steaks. I would recommend coming here for dinner rather than lunch.

The Capital Grille - Wall Street is known for their gigantic wine cellar vault dining room. My boyfriend and I visited here for our first time for Restaurant Week Lunch. We both chose the creamy Clam Chowder as a starter. The Clam Chowderwas filled with an abundance of clams. The Grille's Signature Cheeseburger was cooked perfectly medium rare, but the Truffle Fries were the BEST!!! My Tenderloin Salad was looking a bit sad on the big plate. I wanted to try their filet mignon with my salad, but was told that it was NOT an add-on. I would have to pay an additional $10 to REPLACE my Tenderloin with filet mignon, and same for the bone in dry aged NY strip. I did not choose that option. I'm not used to eating dry-aged steak and would have preferred my steak juicer. The steak tasted very dry like in beef stew. The arugula salad had some cherry tomatoes, wished it would tasted more flavorful. Overall, not incredible steak and bit pricey. You can definitely get better steak elsewhere for a better price, ambiance, and service, in NYC.

Had my Valentine's Day dinner here and it was great. The service, food and vibes are all 10/10. I used to always get the seared tenderloin with butter poached lobster tail (amazing) but I've recently been getting the filet mignon with the porcini rub and it's next level. SO GOOD. Sides also always great. I like the potatoes au gratin and the Brussels sprouts. I go here a lot with my boyfriend and it never gets old!

Update to 5 stars. Kept thinking about my poor steak all day and couldnt wait until the restaurant opened at 5pm. Spoke with the manager Jeffery Horn and he saved the day!

Again, I would suggest packing your own food or at least check you bags before leaving otherwise like I said before service, decor, food exceptional!!

Three stars for me : Do not let the "bus boys" pack your food!!

Found out this morning one of my leftover entrees went missing. Never in my life have I had someone take my food after a courtesy "pack up". This gentlemen had at least a 5 min conversation at my table telling us how he would pack the food - two steaks together and sides in separate boxes. He knew everything on the table needed to be packed togo. This was no accident. Unacceptable.

Really dont even want to write the rest of this review but anyway... the restaurant itself is beautiful!  Definitely a great place for birthdays, anniversaries, date night...very cozy and romantic.

Our actual server, Thalia Alonzo, was exceptional. Very attentive and personable. Food was excellent from the wedge salad with bacon/bleu cheese to NY Strip/Filet Mignon (melt in your mouth so tender). Also, opted for the mashed potatoes which were o so creamy and delicious! I was super full after the entree probably because I consumed too much bread before lol but there is always room for dessert, right? haha.  I didnt think I was going to enjoy the creme brulee but wow I couldnt resist! I had a great experience at this restaurant and was raving about it until I just found out somebody stole one of my to go meals. Smh. Im still in shock. If it wasnt for this I would have rated this restaurant 5 stars.

The Capital Grille is a chain of high-end business restaurants that you will find in many major US cities. Always reliable and always consistent. Good steaks and seafood starters. The wine list is also excellent. Service is efficient. The price is high, but not outrageous. The food is good but more clubby than creative.

Classy Location and setting inside and out. Located in NY's Financial district.
Sam orchestrated a very nice meal. Started with rounds of freshly prepared drinks, table bread and crackers; and some lightly breaded, nicely seasoned fried calamari. Second round....more drinks and some starters - most had the lobster bisque and I had the wedge salad - fresh chunk of iceberg lettuce topped with candied bacon and cherry tomatoes, with just the right amount of dressing.
Next the Flintstones would be proud of a 22oz Bone-In Ribeye prepared with delicate Porcini mushroom crust, topped with a 15-year aged Balsamic sauce, perfect medium rare. The table sides of: Lightly grilled asparagus drizzled with lemon; Soy Glazed Brussels Sprouts with smoked bacon; Au Gratin Potatoes, hearty slices layered with a blend of cheeses and Lobster Mac N Cheese.  All served hot and fresh. We finished with various deserts and coffee. Top quality experience. Not impressed with my photo quality, so no pics this time. I will be back.

I made a reservation for around 8 PM on a Friday. Even though I arrived a bit late, I was still seated promptly.

Ordered the filet mignon and the seared scallops. The seared scallops were absolutely delicious and possibly one of the best dishes I've ever had. The purée used in the ecallops mixed exquisitiely with the asparagus and mushrooms that were also there to ornate the dish. A must try.

The atmosphere was posh and service was excellent, but don't let the ambience fool you! Very reasonably priced, especially for lunch. I ordered the lobster Mac n cheese and was not disappointed! So creamy and delicious! Definitely recommend for any special occasion or first time visitor!

This place is a delight. My boyfriend and I made reservations to celebrate our 3 year anniversary and we had a wonderful time. Everything from the moment we entered, to our waiter, to the food, was great! Our table was retired from everyone else, which was perfect because we had a corner all to ourselves in the second floor, making the night extra special.

The server was VERY knowledgeable and attentive and even offered us a complementary appetizer, which was delicious by the way. We loved him! he seemed very happy to answer all our questions and didn't hesitate to make suggestions throughout our visit.

When it comes to the food, I won't say it was the best steak I've ever had, BUT not disappointing at all and totally worth the price. Huge portion by the way.

I must say the wine was my favorite part! They had an amazing selection and our choice went perfectly with our dinner.

All in all, I definitely recommend this spot! We will definitely be revisiting

This was my boyfriend's chosen eatery for Valentine's Day. We were seated fairly quickly although we arrived an hour after our reservation.

The restaurant is large. We were seated downstairs and we had two servers, whom were both very attentive and friendly. The drinks were displayed on tablets which was very cool. I ordered the French 75 (which I didn't like) and my boyfriend ordered the bourbon drink (he enjoyed it).

For dinner, I ordered the roasted chicken (1/2 chicken) without the Mediterranean olives. My boyfriend ordered the steak. We both felt our entrees tasted okay. As sides, we ordered the lobster Mac and cheese and creamed spinach. I lovee the lobster Mac and cheese. That was the highlight of my dinner!!! Plus, if you see my boyfriend eating mac and cheese then it must be really good cus he doesn't even like Mac and cheese and he really enjoyed it.

The ambience is lovely and the service from the staff is excellent. I would definitely return for that delicious Mac and cheese lol.

My first time was a great experience. The food was delicious. I would definitely recommend for a date night. I loved the lamb chops. I believe the bill was about $150 for two people with two entrees, one shareable side, and two drinks.

Had dinner hear after a long training day with our group..
Always nice to come in here as its classy and great quality.
Great service and everyone was happy with their choices..
One of the steaks was really fatty and grissly, so there wasnt a satisfied diner for that meal but overall it was good..

Here for the a dinner, lobster and crab cake was good but sauce on top was way too salty.  Normally their salad was ok but tonight their salad was extremely salty.

The waitress who took our orders was nice but bus boy was kinda rude.  He seems to be harshed and kept banking my head a couple time.  The part that I was waiting for this dinner was dessert but I was disappointed cause they forgot mine.  One I mentioned it the waitress was like "OMG I totally forgot and what did you order again"  I also asked for tea, by the time she served me tea was just warm.  Really disappointed this time.  I wont go back to this location again.

Sitting at the bar. It's not overly busy. We weren't offered bread we ordered a bourbon and a beer and two iced teas an appetizer and salads waiting on our entree our dirty dishes sat for about  15 min. We about to drop about 200 dollars bartenders consist of one male and a female who is kinda bitchy. Never offered bread but other people were.   Sad very sad. Steak wasn't prepared improperly. Oh well I'll go back to Houston for a steak. As a frequent traveler it's very sad.  Would not come back as New York-has a lot of options. Sad when your potatoes are better than your steak. Giving two stars cause the salad and potatoes were the best part.

Wow, I haven't had a steak dinner like this since I was in Chicago.  This Capital Grille Wall Street location has a dining area right inside of an old  bank vault.

The Creme Brulee was delectable.

The quality of food and service was second to none.  I look forward to going back.

I have been here a ton.  I only come for business and only lunch.  It is across the street from my office.  The service is excellent.  The wine choices by the glass are ok.  I always get the same thing.  The French onion soup is fantastic. The sushi tuna is outstanding.  The flourless chocolate cake is very good.

It is not cheap, but it is also not one one the super expensive restaurants.  All my guests have always enjoyed their meals, most get a steak.

Capital grille is within my work building at 120 Broadway. What I love about my building itself is the ceiling which was featured in Wolf of Wall Street!

As soon as you enter capital grille you hear the numerous business conversations as you pass by to find a seat at the bar. If you choose to sit by the bar, the service is great. The bartenders are friendly and are accommodating to how you would like your drink.

You'll always here one business man call them by them name and say "the usual".

I cane here with my boss  for business right before the our holiday party. He knew the waiter by his name, Brian. He was extremely Accommodating in providing me with a vegetarian pasta option. The pasta was delicious and the portion was amazing. For drinks I had 3 rounds of stoli doli! What I LOVE about capital grill is that their drinks are STRONG. Now there have been times where it is a bit overwhelming so I recommend giving this feedback to your waiter as they are extremely accommodating and nice to adjust your drink preference.

I have great memories at this Capital Grill in particular as it is where my company and I spent out boss's last day. My boss was nice enough to get an gorgeous room in which sat over 10 people. We were able to shut the doors of the room to silence the business chit chats of the main floor. We were told the chefs special which sounded drool worthy but we stuck to appetizers and drinks.
The service was great, the food was delicious and the drinks were able to keep me calm for the awkward conversations that were occasionally Carried out throughout the night

This place is expensive but what do you expect? You're on Wall Street baby
