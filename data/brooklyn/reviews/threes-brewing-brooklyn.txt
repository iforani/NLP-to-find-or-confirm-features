Threes has responded to the pandemic lockdown by increasing their delivery capabilities while maintaining the highest quality of brewing. In a time when GrubHub orders are an uncertain gamble, Threes delivered to my door less than an hour after I placed my order. WOW!

And the beer is so delicious. "Craft" epitomized. Get some Vliet or Logical Conclusion, then tack on 4-packs of whatever is new and exciting. Find a discount code or refer a friend to save $ on your purchase. Threes is doing great and you should get in on the action.

New reservation system for the back yard was very nice given the times. Tables were spread out and the system for purchasing food and drinks was very easy. As always, the beer selection was top notch and the food was DELICIOUS!

Three's is a great place to hang out in Brooklyn. We used to come here a lot pre-COVID, and it was veryyy crowded on the weekends, but if you can snag a table then it's a good time.
During COVID, they've made some changes to accommodate the new policies. You can now reserve a spot in the outdoor garden area in the back (entrance on Butler st) OR first come first serve in the front area. We tried to come without a res, and all the tables were filled already.
But making a reservation is fairly easy for the weekend if you do it during the week.

The outdoor backyard is actually really nice with the tables spread out apart. And I think I saw heaters above for when it gets chilly. There's a QR code on the table to order food (NY law, if you're getting drinks). And it's ACTUAL food, not just chips like Finback and Strong Rope)! And then there's a separate place to order drinks.
In general, Three's beers are just aite for me, but the atmosphere and the fact that they sell liquor/wine/other non-beer drinks keep me coming back! We always have a good time here and the fact that it can't get crowded is even better.

Came here after axe throwing with my friends. I have never had such terrible service inside of a place in NYC before. If you're not enjoying your day, go home... Don't spread your negative energy around everyone else.

We had menus on our table and he took some away before we even had a chance to look at it and rudely said "you guys need 7?" (Sir; there's 11 of us...)

We asked for extra chairs and he said "find them the same way you got the rest." When he came by with food, he said "who is number 30?" We told him it was for our table since we had a big group and the number holder was on our table. And then he's like "yeah but is it yours?" So my friend said "yeah it's mine we ordered wings and veggie burger" and the waiter was like "yeah I know what's in my hand" (Umm.. so what did you expect us to say?)

I have never been so disgusted before by someone's attitude.

Thank you but no thanks. The 11 of us will definitely make sure we never step foot here again.

I'm sad to say that I was once a loyal costumer but will never, ever return to this terrible establishment based on the horrible customer service my friends and I received. The employees here were disrespectful and so so so pushy with ordering food that we ordered out of obligation but not desire. We had just came from eating and just wanted drinks. These employees, including the weekend manager, need to calm down. We were speaking Spanish and they asked us to "quiet down" like excuse me?! We weren't loud at all but maybe we should of spoken in your native language so everyone could hear how discussed we were with this place.

Bye gurl.

Sneakily hidden around the corner, but such a gem in Park Slope. Skinny, but long storefront extends all the way to a back outdoor picnic table area. Food and beer all in one place!

The bartenders were attentive. The live music was awesome. I don't remember what I got, but I always love when you can get a taster size. I almost grabbed some beer to go as a gift for a friend, but was headed to a broadway show and wouldn't be able to bring it in, but that shouldn't stop you from bringing their brew home.

Stop 2, i think, in our mini brewery tour. A main street kinda place with a nice walkup. There are tables in the front, mainly dining? Maybe. As you walk towards the back you pass the kitchen window and enter the bar area. Nice warm feeling, a dark wood bar. Thats the way bars are supposed to be.

We were greeted quickly, handed a menu and the beer is also displayed on the wall. A couple of pints and we moved yo the outside seating in the back.

It's nice, picnic tables, smaller tables, plenty of room. We were the first back there, late afternoon. I chuckled over a rules sign. Number 1 was no kids after 7. Hmm, then the parents and wee babies started coming in. Lol, i cant blame them, i guess. Wasnt an issue. But they were on the clock.

The food all looked really good, real good. We didnt nosh. Pizza was the plan. NY pizza, sorry Florida.

My favorite beer was "far between" an oak aged brew. Very good.

A good place.

Spacious, clean, and classy. I haven't explored this place in its entirety. (Like what's that upstairs space right when you walk in?) But it's clearly a popular spot since I always see so many groups here. The positive spin on this is because they foster a sense of community, like the plethora of weekly events might indicate. And of course an outdoor space that's as close to all year-long as possible is welcome in this concrete jungle. (Could use some more greenery out there, tbh.)

The reason for withholding the final star is simply because I have yet to be blown away by any drinks or food that I've ordered. I guess technically food should be reviewed under a different listing cause the little counter you order food from is / is not affiliated with actual Three's Brewing itself??

Like I've said, I haven't been here enough times to sort that all out, but as summer summer time rolls around again, I'm happy to come through and test out the experience again soon!

(Teacher Appreciation Friday's, feel free to lure me back in anytime!)

I love Threes! I have visited several times, some to just pick up beer and others to stay and enjoy a beer outside.

Threes makes some amazing beers that you need to try. some of my favorites are constant disappointment and unreliable narrator. They have an amazing outdoor space to check out during the better weather months. They also have a separate beer shop to pick up some goodies to bring with you.

All in all 5/5 for amazing space and beer.

Stopped in for a drink with my daughter while in Brooklyn.  She had scoped it out ahead of time.  Walked thru a residential area to get there.  Bartenders were friendly and helpful and quick with service.  They offer different sizes so that you can make your own "flight" or get a large one of your favorite!  They had a four person band playing bluegrass music which made for a great atmosphere.   Outside seating was also available and it was a gorgeous day for that.  Good selection of their own brews.  I would return when in the area!

My cousin's choice for our last meal together before I headed out of town.  This place was spread out across a couple of rooms between two levels and an outdoor patio.  We ordered and paid for our food order at the counter near the door  With a number pole in tow, we proceeded to grab a table in the adjoining room where the beer bar was located.

Music plus the ambient noise from all of the people in the room did make it tough to talk.  But there was an unmistakable buzz to the room from the music to the people eating/drinking/conversing around us.  The lighting in the room was a bit dim so it did make it a bit hard to read the beer selection menu.  I was seated at the table so my cousin handled it.

We each both got sandwiches and fries were decent.  The small kitchen that they have turned out good food considering what seems like a lack of space inside their kitchen.

I ended my NYC day with a hazy IPA which was great because I've already consumed too much beer and my kidney/liver were saying no mas.

This place was close to the LIRR station which was where I was headed right after the meal.  Barely made it too as the driver saw me running into the boarding area.  I probably used a lot of karma points that night.

Roomy, good beer, and some food to go with it?  I didn't even have a chance to try their non beer options but I hope I will when I come back to this neighborhood again.

Came here on a bright but cold Saturday afternoon and I'm a big fan of the space itself. The bar is pretty big -- they have a backyard (which was taken over by someone's 30th birthday party the day we went), the main bar area, some sunny window seats in the front, and some back seating up a short flight of stairs (where the Ninth Street Espresso is).

The beers I tried were all pretty good (Logical Conclusion, Crying on the Inside, Unreliable Narrator -- also, who comes up with these names?!), although they all honestly kind of tasted the same to me (I am not a beer enthusiast). The service was a little disappointing, took a long time to get any of the bartenders' attention. I understand that it can take a minute to get to everyone when it's busy, but a little eye contact or a nod goes a long way... please just acknowledge my existence so I know you're coming back to my spot at some point. That said, am already excited to come back here in the summer, when it's warm enough to sit in the backyard.

Brooklyn is a hot bed of breweries and Threes Brewing sticks out amongst them. From the funky tap list to the amazing food they are dishing out Threes must be on your Brooklyn itinerary. Step into the converted warehouse and order food at the walkup window - Farm to table sausage biscuit sandwich was amazing! Tons of flavors I wouldn't have put together myself. The burger was also very flavorful and a good size portion. While you wait for your food, wander back to the bar. 15 beers on tap, mostly theirs, but some of their brewing friends as well. Order a flight and try them all out.

There is a cool patio out back. We didn't sit out there, but had great space and some shade.

Threes is one of my favorite breweries in NYC for a variety of reasons. Lets start with the most important, the beer.

Threes has a nice variety of in house sours, ales, saisons, ipas and darker beers. Something for everyone and they are all tasty. They also dedicate ~25% of their tap list to rotating external breweries often from NYC or NY state. In addition, Threes has two refrigerators filled with bottles and cans of their own beers and hand picked others.

The food: While the brewery doesn't make food, they have a fairly permanent food provider in the Meat Hook who is constantly updating their menu with exciting new options. Expect to always be able to find something like a burger or a fried chicken sandwich among other items. Nachos are definitely underrated.

The space:  Amazing mix of trendy indoor area and outdoor space. All beers can be ordered at the bar or if you want to sit, via table service. Food is ordered at the meat hook counter and they find where you are sitting. The outdoor area is great year round as they tent it during the winter.   The upstairs of the brewery includes a "coffee shop" where they serve beer and coffee and can provide a quieter atmosphere if desired. They also have a private room upstairs for hosting parties. We held a birthday party there and it was a great experience. The staff was very attentive to everyone's food and drink needs.

Definitely worth a visit if you are in NYC.

Came here with a page out of the Brooklyn Pub Pass book.

This place looks small from the outside, but it's actually freaking huge! When you first walk in, there's booths on the left for people to enjoy their beer and food. On the right, there is a small kitchen powered by the Meat Hook. After a beer or two, get the pepperoni stick for $5. It's delicious!

The main bar is all the way towards the back. It's decorated with little barrels of beer around it. Across from the bar are more tables for people to sit. There is also an upstairs where they have live music, but we didn't make it up there this time. We arrived around 9:30ish last night and it was packed!

The first beer I started off with was the Threes Wandering Bine. It's orange-y in color, and slightly stronger than other Saisons. I finished it relatively quickly. The next two I ordered after were Blueberry Pop and the Threes Counterpart. I expected the Blueberry Pop to be on the sweeter side when I saw it was brewed with vanilla and milk and sugar, but it was actually really tart. It comes in a pretty dark purple color. The Counterpart was fruity and refreshing. It also had a pleasant floral smell.

My friend ordered the cocktail made with tequila and cinnamon, I forgot the name of it but it was delicious and perfect for that cold night!

The food menu looked interesting but we weren't too hungry because we had just eaten before we got here. When I come back, I definitely want to try what the Meat Hook has to offer and finish off that draft menu.

Great selection of brews at great price points for tasting or a full glass. Not sure about the food, but looked decent for bar food. I recommend trying the sampler sizes on the menu and drink your way down the list until it all tastes the same and then just blindly pick the next.

Had a great time here with friends while I was in town visiting. It felt a lot like the bars we have in Austin, big and outdoorsy, lots of seating, lots of picnic tables.

Drinks were good and the bartender in the back was super nice. Actually everyone who worked there was nice. Will definitely come back if I'm ever in town again and want a cold beer.

We were on a Brooklyn Brewery tour and Threes Brewing made the list.  It was a gorgeous Saturday afternoon and I think there was some race that day where runners could come in with their bib number and get a discount.  Needless to say, the place was PACKED.  The main bar was so full, you could hardly move.  A server told us that we could possibly find seats in the cafe upstairs.

The upstairs area has a very small seating area that is tucked away and is more low-key and quiet.  There is a coffee cafe and also a small bar where you can get beer only.  If you want anything other than beer, you have to go to the main bar.

We found seats for four of us in a back room off the side of the cafe.  It felt a little dodgy upstairs--rickety tables with random chairs, a service entrance of some sort that people kept going in and out of.  But at least we had a seat and it was not as hot upstairs as the other areas seemed to be.

I made a wine run at the main bar.  It took a while to get served with all of those people but I finally succeeded.  But it was not worth my time or effort to go back through that mess to get another glass of wine.  I tried one of the porters from the bar upstairs.  It was good and very reasonably priced.

We wanted to try the food but the line for food and the chaos downstairs made us want to leave and find food elsewhere.  It was an interesting visit.  Maybe we'll come back on a random weekday and try it again.

6/19/2019Hey Angela,

Thanks for checking out Threes and for sharing your thoughtful review.

It seems as if you came on a particularly busy Saturday and had less than a stellar experience. While we do try to accommodate everyone that visits the brewery by featuring 3 different bars with lots of seating, we realize that sometimes capacity is still finite relative to the demand.

With that being said, we'd love to host you anytime you are up for coming back. If you want to give it a shot, feel free to hit us up via email (info at threesbrewing dot com) and we'll be ready for you!

Thanks again,
@threesbrewing

This place has a massive backyard area that is perfect in the summer! Extremely spacious with lots of seating and standing room. Perfect place for a summer night especially once all the lights come on.

They had a killer sour on tap, the Dictator is the People, officially a Belgian saison.

also ordered some food. They only take orders at the front, but they'll bring the food to your number.
Dry aged burger with raclette cheese - on the smaller side but pretty good for a brewery
Order of fries - pretty sizeable
Hot chicken sandwich - fried chicken was not very uniform and honestly a bit difficult to eat

Threes is quickly becoming one of my favorite places in Brooklyn. I used to live in south slope, and would go to other half often. I love other half, because I enjoy IPAs and think other half may have some of the best beer I've ever had. But Threes offers a much broader experience than just very good beer, which it undoubtedly has as well. They offer a lot more varieties and many beers that are not even their own. They also have a fully stocked bar so it has a bit for anyone, you don't have to be just a beer fan. Their space is also more enjoyable. There's a lot more room, more seats, outdoor area, food options, and even live music (which I have not have the privilege of experiencing yet). Overall, this is a great place, with a little something for everyone. Can't wait for the weather to get nicer again to take advantage of the outdoor space.

I had a really bad experience here on a Sunday over the summer. The manager made my friends and I feel soooo uncomfortable. She was very hostile towards us, first staring at us and discussing our party with other staff. I had no idea what she was talking about - there was plenty of room, we weren't loud at all. We were so confused.

After the manager was so creepy, I wanted to leave but we were there for a friend's bday so I had to stay to celebrate her. I have to stress - our party was spending money. We got rounds and rounds of drinks and food. Some people were drinking coffee. I cannot prove this was the reason we were treated so badly, but there were persons of color in our group who agreed that the manager was eyeing us but not other groups... hmmm... I felt embarrassed and annoyed at the treatment. All the service was miserable. The person working the food counter was so hostile, she slammed down my fries on the tray and then spilled. At which point I was like Efff this were leaving. I don't get it but I'm not going to think about it. I just won't ever come back.

Business Owner

11/5/2018Hello Gigi,

This message was just brought to our attention by one of our regular patrons.  It was pretty alarming so we felt compelled to reply...

We're so sorry to hear that you did not have a positive experience at Threes Brewing.  We take hospitality very seriously and it is our job to make you feel at home, which we clearly did not do.  For that we are truly sorry.

That said, your allegations of racial profiling are quite troubling.  Our staff was shocked and dismayed by this accusation and had no recollection of the incident (including our Sunday manager, who, by the way, is a person of color).

If you are open to sharing more info about the episode, we'd love to talk to you. Please contact us (info at threesbrewing dot com) or let us know the best way to reach you.  While we do respect your feelings, we do believe there is at least some level of misunderstanding here.

Regards,
@threesbrewing

Absolutely loved Threes Brewing! If it's a nice day out, grab a seat on the back patio...it's adorable, chill and a great time. Definitely my favorite brewery while in Brooklyn.

I had a 10 ounce pour of Divided Line for $6, a solid 4/5 bottlecap 4.4% sessionable fruity IPA.

I also tried a few tasters ranging in price from $3-4 and enjoyed them all! Arbiter of Fun a 5.2% sour, Touchy Subject a 6.4% IPA, Logical Conclusion a 7% IPA, and Voluntary Exile a 9.2% Baltic Porter to round them out. Not a big brew in the bunch!

Great service, great brews, reasonable prices and a cool ass back patio, yep I'll be back next time I'm in the 'hood.

We recently had our wedding at the Threes Brewing Greenpoint location and it was amazing. The venue at night is beautiful with the large windows in the front. The wood throughout the venue made the pictures look amazing. Alyssa kept everything organized and made us feel comfortable the entire time. At one point before the wedding we realized we had not eaten and she went into the back and made us a small sandwich. Way above and beyond. We had family and friends from all over and many said it was one of the best dinners they have ever eaten ever.
We were extremely stressed leading up to the event but Alyssa also had suggestions on what previous couples had done as far as guest books, card boxes and music. The bartenders were also great and even signed our guest book. If you are planning a somewhat low key wedding in a beautiful space (and delicious beers), this is the place.

Very solid brewery in BK. The food in the late night menu was decent not great so giving it a bit lower but the beer is awesome on tap. Plenty of it. Also wine and cocktails for those not into beer. Lots of tables in the front back and outside. Ideal for a good weather day since they have a big backyard.

Came on a rainy Saturday afternoon.

Meh...something very "anti-social" about the feel of this place. Maybe it's the loud concrete atmosphere, or the impersonal feel of ordering and plopping the number sign down where you sit.

$12 for the small brat was a tasty snack.
$12 for the tiny glasses of wine was bordering on overpriced.

I'd sum it up like this, it tries to bridge the gap between the avocado toast generation and everybody else.  i.e. people sitting at the bar and eating and then deciding they're going to move to a booth.
I'm not sure if it's working.  2 bartenders can't handle a full crowd when people want to sample stuff.

If beer is still your thing, then there is something here for you.

If comfort and class is your thing, keep looking.

A place only to get a drink. The food here is a disaster. It was obvious they only have the level of food to feed people so they won't die of starving, or the level of salty fries so u can buy more beer.
The burger use the bread you buy from supermarket and over salty  fries tasted bad oil. And it's super overpriced. The place is no classic itself with not too interesting decoration.

Threes is probably my favorite spot to drink in the city and is a real 5 tool player.

The large, open outdoor space, the warm inside with its spacious tables, the bar itself; Threes wears many different hats. You see this in the beer -- a rotating tap selection, a wonderful to-go section; the food -- the meat hook offerings are great (the aged burger is intense, split amongst a group); there's even coffee.

The layout is a little confusing, but it's forgiven for the sheer variety of ways you can experience Threes.

It's really quite unfortunate that the service here is so awful, since the bar itself is decent. A group of 8 of us showed up on a Saturday around 4pm. The place was already super crowded, so we tried the (covered and heated) outdoor space. A couple of us sat at one of the communal tables while others stood around. It was then that this awful waiter (medium height, black hair) roughly shoved us to get by. He then turns around and says to us, in a rude and confrontational manner, "I SAID excuse me. I didn't mean to push you, but also, LOOK at the passageway you left me" (gesturing behind us). First of all, if you want to control the crowded space, talk to your own management, asshat. There were people standing EVERYWHERE. Second of all, how were we supposed to just know that where we were standing was the designated walking path?? It was our first time there.

Asshole waiter aside, we ordered and paid for a Meat Hook burger ($14) but they brought to us a veggie burger ($13). When we stopped an employee walking by and notified him, he told us that he was a busboy and doesn't not handle issues with orders, and that we'd have to bring the dish back to the front of the bar for it to be replaced. We didn't feel like waiting in the crowds, and then wait 20 minutes for them to replace the burger, so we just ate it. It actually wasn't bad-tasting; a little under seasoned, but a little ketchup perked it up.

All in all, good bar, good food/beer, GARBAGE SERVICE.

Two good IPA and great prices at $8 pint and 4 oz pours available for $4. Try as many as you like and hang out here.  It's loud but tons of real estate to bring a group upstairs or out back. Quick service and burgers and choke. Sandwich looked quick good. Open late and offer full bar as well as the dozen or so beer list. Really top notch beer centric bar in the area to get local varieties that are tough to come by at local restaurant to.

Cool spot with great beers.

Vliet is a namesake pils for a reason - dry, crisp, with a slight bitter finish to make you want a second sip.
Logical Conclusion is probably my favorite though, with its super fruity and balanced hops/fizz/smooth mouthfeel. It's a perfect summer brew, really.

Backyard is chill, and food from meat hook looked dope. Wish I saved my stomach for some bites here.

Will be back in the future.

This was my first stop of the evening in beautiful Brooklyn! We had a party of 5 and we found seats right away when we walked in. Very rustic setting! But beautiful marble tables! The noice levels were great we weren't yelling at each other. The selection of beers were huge. You could spend a day there tasting and enjoying.  The had a great food coming out the kitchen! We had spicy chicken wings. They were huge! Plus delicious crispy fries! Highly recommend this cozy place.

I really liked this space! It is huge, and being there on a Friday evening was awesome. Being there on a Saturday night, not so much. I was amazed and how packed it could get, but the beers are awesome.

They have food, beer, a coffee bar upstairs, a patio, merch. I dig it.

There are a nice selection of beers to suit all tastes (especially if you don't loooOoOOove IPAs like everyone else), and the beer names are hilariously good.

It was a little confusing when walking in if we could snag a table but you can, which is nice. I like a place that just does bar service and that's it. That's what bars should do.

I came here with the fiance because of the beer and I was hungry and saw they have food by the Meat Hook which is from my hood and Meat Hook has never disappointed me.

The beer was good I had a few of their house draft beers called "Here Ya Go" that's described as Capri Sun, Gooseberry, Kiwi, Apricot, Dank Finish. I had a medium rare burger (because that's how I like it) from the menu and fries, it was a small burger, to me it looked like an upgrade from a slider, maybe a jumbo slider. Guys, I need more burger for $17, I need carbs to sustain more carbs from beer! My fiance devoured his burger in 2-3 bites but had way more beers than I did.
Anyway, the space is actually really amazing, it actually looks awesome to throw a party in although I'm not sure if they even cater to that sort of thing. I would go back for beers in their back yard when the sunshine decides to come through in the near future.

Great atmosphere, and some really good beers. The food is really good as well, and there is plenty of areas to hang out with friends and enjoy. Highly recommend.

Hubby and I recently went bar hopping in Gowanus and checked out Threes Brewing on a rainy Sunday afternoon. We waited for the rain to stop to enjoy the outdoor patio. It's pretty cool and there are a lot of great beers on tap.

However, my negative rating has to do with the shady cashier at the food station, otherwise known as "The Meat Hook." When I ordered my $14 veggie burger using my credit card, she cheerfully entered the information but also sneaked in a $3 tip for herself without my knowledge. I didn't know this until after I signed the iPad and got the receipt emailed to me. I usually tip servers in cash, so I was appalled.

I'm posting this so that others be warned of this kind of shady behavior whenever you order anything from the "Meat Hook" window. Pay with cash or double check the amount BEFORE you leave that cashier window. And WATCH that cashier's tapping fingers before he/she swivels the iPad around for you to sign.

In all my years going to eateries that use iPads for payment, I've never experienced something like this. Apparently meat is not the only thing that gets "hooked" at the Meat Hook, where all the privileged Brooklynites are too busy getting drunk to notice they're being fleeced. But as a penny-wise Queens resident, I sure as heck ain't coming here again.

Comment from Josh S. of Threes Brewing

Business Owner

6/5/2019Threes Brewing is a separate company from The Meat Hook, however, they are our business partner and take customer feedback as seriously as we do. Below is a note from their General Manager.

__________________________

Hi Jennifer,

Thank you for taking the time to write to us about your visit to our restaurant. I want to sincerely apologize for the negative experience you had and the customer service you received. As a business, customer satisfaction is our top priority here at the Meat Hook, and I am so sorry we failed to uphold our high hospitality standards in this situation.

Regarding gratuity, tipping our staff is always optional. Please note that our point of sale system, not the cashier, has a default gratuity in place for credit card payments; however, if customers don't want to leave a tip or if they want to change the tip amount, they have the option to do so directly on the screen. Our cashiers are trained to inform customers about this step of the transaction, but based on your review it is clear that she did not properly communicate this to you. I assure you we value and appreciate our customers and their hard-earned money, and none of our employees would intentionally steal from patrons. I do see, however, how our lack of clear communication in this instance created a "shady" situation and caused you to feel taken advantage of. Please know that we are taking your feedback to heart and will take every action necessary to resolve this issue; additionally, because of your thoughtful review, we are re-examining our gratuity system and working on implementing a more transparent method moving forward.

We would love the opportunity to serve you again and regain your trust. I would also like to refund your bill from the day in question. Please reach out to me directly charity at the-meathook dot com so we can get this taken care of.

Again, thank you so much for taking the time to bring this to our attention. We are always looking for ways to improve and your thoughtful review gives us the opportunity to learn from this experience and to make changes to be the best we possibly can.

Hope to hear from you soon.

Best,
Charity

Had SUCH a great experience here! The beer menu is extensive and the names are really fun! My boyfriend and I got a bunch of 5-oz pours (I wish they had actual flights because it was hard to keep track of the beers we were trying!) and they were all exceptional. We both agreed that the Short Fuse was our definitive favorite, because we could actually taste the smokiness and it was so interesting without being overly ~fancy or anything! It was so fun to try all of the beers & to look for the crazy tasting notes that they had put in the menu. To add to this really fun time, our bartenders were exceptional and were happy to help with recommendations and also with keeping track of which beers we had and hadn't tried. All-in-all, had such a great time here and cannot wait to return.

Winter Sunday not too crowded. Service ok. Solid solid hoppy pils called Vliet!  The pale ale is one of the orange juicy tasting haze ales which I am not a fan of but if that's what you're into it's a good style.
Friendly staff. Good vibes.

Excellent vibes at this brewery.  Ambience was just what you are looking for on a Sunday hanging out with friends.  Pitchers galore and conversation buzzing, the beer list at this literal hole-within-a-wall-within-a-wall has all of the various hops and tastes the everyday drinker can enjoy.  Take enough sips of their "the world is flat" concoction and you will literally begin to see your world becoming flatter and flatter.

Food here was iffy for me on the other hand.  I ordered a fried chicken sandwich that was delicately cooked yet the choice of which actual part of the chicken did not settle with my taste buds nor my stomach.  Chicken thighs are delish, but not great on a sandwich.  Don't forget about the breast yo.

For sure will come back.  This is what breweries are all about.
