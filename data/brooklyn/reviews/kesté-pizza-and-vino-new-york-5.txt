Hands down best gluten free pizza I've ever had. I was really impressed. The dough is soft and fresh, you can tell it wasn't pre-made. So many options, too. Usually when places have a GF option it's really limited, but here you can get any pizza with GF crust. If you are gluten free, you have to try this pizza. Bonus: you can get nationwide delivery, too!

On my non GF days, I want to try the regular pizza. If the GF is this good, I can't imagine what the standard crust is like. I am absolutely eating here again.

I had my first experience at Keste years ago when I was first moving to the city. I remember the ambience being very cozy and quaint - transporting you a little Italian restaurant. I also remember the pizza being very delicious, so I'm extremely disappointed in myself for not going back all these years. This was where my love for Quattro Formaggi pizza all started.

Anyways, flash forward in time to this quarantine and I've been absolutely craving pizza. Given that everyone seems to be making their own at home, I figured I'd support this Italian gem that I knew was also supporting the local hospitals during this time. I'm so glad I chose it too because it really hit the spot. I kid you not when I say it took me days of staring at all the options on the menu to figure out which kind I wanted. There's so many flavors that it's overwhelming because you truly want them all. I wish I could've done a slice of 4 different kinds! But I ended up going with the GF Ricotta pizza, and boy am I glad that I did. It was so cheesy with the right amount of sauce as well. The crust didn't even strike me as GF - it was so doughy and flavorful! Even the next day when I reheated in the oven, just as good! The pizzas are a pretty good personal size, so I would recommend getting at least 2 if you're sharing with anyone!

I will definitely be ordering again because I'm dying to try one of the pizzas with truffle, and I can't wait until I can dine in again! Thanks for another delicious experience Keste!

So they no longer do the $5 pie. I got the Margherita pie for $13. For the size, it's quite overpriced. It's essentially four half-slices. It's pretty good, but I would in no way say it's the best pizza in NY. It's a standard personal pie on par with others in the neighborhood. Great cheese, very little sauce, thick crust. About a ten-minute wait for the food to come out. A few tables outside.

The waiter told me they are closing this location shortly and leaving the other one open only, FYI.

I haven't tried too many of their pizzas and I don't see myself ever really ordering a variety.

Why, you ask? Two words: the Diavola.

Spicy, cheesy, and oily (in the best way!), this pizza packs a punch. I've been tempted by others but every time I call to place my order it's as if I am possessed by my inner food gremlin. It demands, nay, needs an entire Diavola pizza.

The pizza itself is not large. A person with better self-control might be able to share. That person is not nor will it ever be me. The crust is soft and chewy, which I didn't ever see myself preferring. Yet here we are.

I am being held hostage by a preternatural creature of insatiable appetite and I like it that way.

I went back to New York with my brother to visit the great city of New York City and our birthplace home in Far Rockaway. We wandered in the financial district and sat down to have a fabulous gluten-free pizza for me since I am celiac. Very well made pizza with a great crust that approximated the best of New York Pizza. We then walked around heading up to Murray's which offered the best NY Cheesecake I've ever eaten. We then walked over to a small park at Bleecker and 6th Avenue to eat 1/2 of my cheesecake. Great pizza, great cheesecake, great city. What more can you ask?

Fantastic food. Nice outdoor seating. Great staff. The food has to be delicious and just like you'd get back home in Italy.

Great coffee too afterwards to finish off the meal.

Can't believe my last review for this place was over 10 years ago, but this place is an institution!

Churning out incredible Napalese pizza, I've been consistently visiting this place for the past 10 years and figured its time to update my review.

The pizza is still hands down amazing. The perfect chewy Naples style dough, topped with the perfectly flavorful tomato sacue, fresh mozzarella cheese, and a nice touch of basil. Or sausage mushroom, which is always so hard to decide which to get (we end up getting both and sharing most of the time).

What's also amazing is this place offers a truly celiac-friendly gluten free options (baked at the lower level in an separate oven) that has the same chewy, doughyness as the gluten-full version. They even have a fried doughy gf dessert that is amazingly tasty and definitely a guilty pleasure treat.

And with this stay-in-place going on... it's nice to see Keste is still delivering their food and keeping up the morale of New Yorkers. Support a local business, and grab an out-of-this-world amazing pie.

YUM.

For a topping lover, I can't believe I found the sausage(which is delicious) to be too strong for the tasty fresh mozzarella on the pizza, the mild and "just right" tomato paste, and the chewy, perfectly baked crust.

The service is friendly, and such a cute little sit-down place for a nice meal too!

I had a mission of finding a good gluten-free pizza place in New York in order to accommodate for Celiac disease. This came up on my searches, and lo and behold it was right next to John's of Bleecker Street which I had wanted to go to anyways. So we came here first before going over to John's.

They said any pizza could be made as gluten-free for $4 more, so prosciutto and arugula pizza was selected. I gave it a try to see how it was. The greatest compliment I could give to the pizza is that...WOW, IT TASTES LIKE NORMAL PIZZA. I'm used to most gluten-free pizzas having crusts that taste like crackers. No, this legitimately tasted like regular pizza. If you had told me this was a gluten-free pizza, I would've said "you're full of it." Definitely the real deal.

Service here is great. They know a lot of people come here specifically for the gluten-free pizza and make sure to cook it in separate oven from the regular one. No complaints here.

I'm very impressed by their gluten-free pizza. Definitely wouldn't mind coming back to try some of their regular pizzas!

Had planned on going to John's on Bleecker as I haven't been there since I was a kid. With a line around the block, I looked across the street and saw Keste, a spot I'd heard great things about, but never tried.

Well, if I'm down in the village, I may just have a new go to spot!

First of all, service was super friendly and quick. Our whole meal, and we were on a bit of a clock, probably took all of 30 minutes from sitting down to paying the check. Excellent.

The pear and walnut salad was a great start, very fresh and a nice portion.

The pizza was excellent. Who doesn't love a good coal fired pizza? But, with so many doing it so well, what makes this stand out? Beyond the excellent dough, it's the sauce here that shines. Perfect consistency, with the right amount of heat.

Will definitely be back!

I've been going there for years. Great place great food. I showed up yesterday for lunch, opened the door at 5 mimutes to noon and walked in. Staff was lounging at the bar. Definately not conducting business. They rudely told me/ us ( a party of 4) we are not opened for another five minutes, wait outside. So we left went to an excellent competitor up the block and have no intent or desire to ever return.

We stumbled upon this gem while enjoying the beautiful weather yesterday. Though we were seated right away, as we were enjoying our refreshing drinks, we noticed the patio filled up quickly - a testament to the delicious pizza that were about to enjoy! We split a gluten free margarita pizza- the best gluten free crust we have had in the city topped with perfect ratio of cheese:mozzarella. To end out delightful dinner, we had shared a mouth-watering Nutella dessert. We were thrilled to hear that Kesté delivers to our apartment in Midtown East! 5 stars for ambiance, food, and service. Bravo!

No shame here: the only reason I stopped into Keste was because their sign seemed too good to be true. A personal pizza for $5. Being NYC, I was expecting a small, hipster pizza that would have me hungry by the time I got home, but I was totally wrong!

The Margherita Pizza I had was not only filling but delicious! There was also the option of getting the white version of this pizza. Unfortunately this was the only option I found to be reasonably priced on the menu- adding additional toppings doubled the price (and while I love pepperoni, my budget doesn't love pepperoni for $5).

Make sure everyone in your party is on time because they only seat entire groups (or maybe just tell THAT friend you're meeting an extra half hour early before the rest of you arrive)

Kesté is a great place to dine (especially for lunch $9 gluten free pizzas). I ate the whole thing as I had walked for ages that morning and was replacing the calorie deficiency. I thought 'whoa I'm eating the whole thing, I'm really going for it.' Then, the gorgeous girls next to me said well I'm gong to eat my whole pizza so I didn't feel bad. They were young and gorgeous so it must be okay.

Gluten free crust is soft and unlike any other gluten free pizza I've ever had. It doesn't taste like it has a bunch of preservatives or crab loaded in it. It tastes clean and like the real deal. Also it's made in a separate kitchen. The owner must have in depth knowledge of gluten issues.

Joint is nice and cozy and great place to warm up in the cold weather. The lovely girl waiting on me was highly efficient. The pizzas came out in a timely way, all presented well in their round pie glory.

This place has $5 margarita pizzas....what??? That's as much as you'd might pay for a slice in some spots. Unfortunately, it's the other pies that are a lot more expensive.

Overall, I thought the pizzas were solid and I wouldn't mind coming back here. I would always come back for a margarita one.

We had the mushroom and prosciutto pizza, and a meat lovers one called the butcher. These three pies more or less fed 5 people.

The downside for these pizzas was that it was a bit thin, and you could just pick up a slice without assuring it somehow as it was floppy and the ingredients would just collapse. I've def had better ones in the city. Thicker dough would've given it more texture vs just a crust and a soggy middle.

In terms of overall it's maybe 4*, but relative to other spots, I'd have to give it 3*.

Keste Pizza & Vino is not your standard New York pizza. Keste serves real deal Neapolitan pizza with key ingredients imported from Naples. The flour and the tomatoes come from Naples and they are the secret to amazing pizza. The base and crust are perfectly cooked, thin but chewy. We had a pizza and a calzone. Both were terrific. Service was fine and the wine lIst was adequate. Cheaper than a flight to Napoli!

Still one of the best. I've been here numerous times, and they are consistently good. The dough is so great that I actually crave and look forward to the crust, which is pretty wild. I recently tried Pizza Del Re, and it's become my new favorite white pizza. It has truffle cream, prosciutto, mushrooms, and of course plenty of cheese. So flavorful - definitely try this if you like mushroom!

This is definitely one of my favorite pizza places in New York. I can always count on Keste when I'm craving Neapolitan pizza. The dough is always perfectly cooked so that it's fluffy and chewy. I usually share one white pizza (prosciutto arugula) and red pizza (margherita or other). Here's a pro tip: dip the crust in the house-made spicy red chili oil. It's got quite a kick, but it is so so good. Ambience is no-nonsense rustic - nothing to write home about, but certainly feels homey.

It's meh! We ordered the pizza del re (mozzarella, mushrooms, prosciutto, truffle). The dough was way too thin and wet. The middle part of the pizza was very soggy and we had to use forks and knives to eat it. The moisture from the mozzarella was running off the wet dough. The truffles tasted like bland mushrooms with no flavor. I couldn't tell they were truffles.

We saw the other table order the marinara pizza and it looked tastier so we gave it a try. It was better than the pizza de re but the dough was still very thin and soggy in the middle. At least the topping and sauce wasn't sliding off the dough and we didn't need utensils to scoop it up.

We overheard the table next to us. "I swear last time I was here it tasted so much better!" said the guy who also ordered the marinara pizza.

I guess the highlight was the tomato basil salad. The cherry tomatoes tasted fresh and mozzarella was light and soft.

There's not much thrill. I don't think we're gonna come back.

Close to NYU. Cozy space. Nice service. With a very nice deal for lunch! Very good crust, simple and good flavor. A friend of mine who works at NYU took me there saying it was one of her favorite spots , and I liked it as well. Salad was not as memorable..but will definitely visit and try more things next time I'm nearby.

Went there as the line at John's was long and it was raining and was pleasantly surprised. Most people about neapolitan pies, but this is as authentic as it gets. The pies are like you get in Rome, one pie per person, light and fluffy. The $5 margarita pizza is a steal and must try. Probably the thinnest pizza you have tasted. We tried their Keste special pizza and it was delicious. The crust is not crunchy as the dough is different and probably better on your stomach than perfect 00 flours. Their.speciality pizzas are a bit pricey, but if you order the $5 one along with others, its not that bad.

Eh not my favorite. Out of the three pizza places I visited today... (Lombardi's, Brunetti) this was my least favorite which doesn't mean it wasn't good it just means it wasn't the best. Lol crust was a little doughy, chewy which my daughter preferred but their Margherita pizza lacked pizzazz. Almost bland. The pizza called Regina with the burrata cheese was delicious! Everything was very very fresh. Very small.. place cozy.

My friends and I came to Kesté around 5pm on a Friday.  When we arrived, the restaurant was about a quarter full, so we were seated immediately.  When we left around 6pm, the restaurant was almost full, so if you can, try to get there early so you do not need to wait!  The interior has a casual, homey vibe.

Kesté specializes in Neapolitan pizzas, so you won't find the NYC style pizza here.  We ordered a margherita with mushrooms ($16), Macellaio (The Butcher) ($24), and a truffle burrata pizza ($25).  The Butcher included tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, sausage, porchetta, Crespone salami, prosciutto di Parma, basil, and extra virgin olive oil.  The truffle burrata had home-made burrata filled with black and white truffle cream, grape tomatoes, basil, prosciutto di Parma, and extra virgin olive oil.  Each pizza was about 10 inches in diameter.  You could split one if you're not that hungry, but if you come starving, one pizza should satisfy you.  We all enjoyed our pizzas.  It's the perfect balance of crust and toppings.  The pizza also has a juicy quality without being too heavy on the oil.

Service at the restaurant was average.  They did one check-back and filled our waters once.  Although I did thoroughly enjoy my pizza, the steep pricing will only have me coming back once in a while.

Came here with 2 friends, love that they have $5 pies. I ordered the marinara (I just wish there was a little more basil) my friends ordered the margherita & margherita w/ sausage. They provide red pepper flakes and a spicy olive oil - which I'm obsessed with because I LOVE spicy food. For appetizer we ordered the burrata which was also really yummy and creamy.

To be honest, I'm not sure if I would come back for the regular priced pies, as they are mostly $15+. Overall quick& efficient service, would definitely come back!!

Ahhh! Best gluten free and celiac-friendly restaurant ever! A girlfriend of mine is always limited due to having Celiac. She never really gets to enjoy going out for meals due to being worried about getting sick. I do my best to look up places for us to check out and I'm SO glad I read a review about this place. They do, indeed, have a separate kitchen where they prepare theIr gluten free options! The staff are so wonderful. This place is a bit small and does get busy but I've never been somewhere where I felt it was so worth it! I don't even need to eat gluten free but you wouldn't be able to tell! My friend admitted she's never had such great gluten free bread/crust. We will definitely be returning!!!

I'd heard a lot about the Pizza at Keste. We started with a Rustic salad with artichoke prosciutto and a light lemon vinaigrette dressing. Greens were fresh and the bread was even different. A good different. Very rustic and healthy flavor. Then came the pizza. And here is where you have to know authentic Italian pizza and this is authentic. Thin crust with just the right amount of crispness. An outer crust that wasn't too thick and perfect to eat every bite.  We had the Georgia pizza with fresh mozzarella, lemon marinated bresaola, arugula, shaved parmigiano reggiano and extra virgin olive oil. A wonderful combination. Great service. The restaurant is kind of cramped and small but where isn't it in New York City. I would suggest eating there though because there is nothing better than fresh out of the oven.

Amazing Lunch Special!! If your in the area looking for a great cheap lunch here is where you should head. The have 11' basic personal pizzas for $5, $5 salads and special 8' pies for around $10-$12.

I choose one of the speciality pies; it had pistachio pesto, sausage and mozzarella for $11. Honestly is was amazing! I was a little wary about how good it would be because of how many stickers this place has on the door talking about how it's the best this place deserves all of those. One of the best pizza's I had in a very long time. The table held a bottle of spicy oil which took this already great pizza to even higher heights.

As much as I wanted to get a glass of wine, $11 for a Pinot during lunch is too steep for me. There are so many good places with cheaper drinks it wasn't worth getting a glass of wine the same price as my pizza.

I took a star off for how in my face the servers were. Please just let me eat without you hovering over me with the need to fill my glass of water every time I take a sip. Breathing room is my friend please respect it.

We came here based on a recommendation and our experience wasn't bad but we were a bit disappointed. The food itself was good, however the vibe was very strange. Three men (not sure if owners or servers) stared at us and spoke quietly while watching us during the entire. freaking. meal. I don't expect to encounter the sweetest people when in NYC but I guess we expected not to be stared down while trying to eat pizza.

Good thing New York doesn't have a shortage on pizza because we probably won't be back.

The pizza here is really unique snd it is fun to atleast try it once. We tried the margherita pizza (5$). The portion of the pizza was big and it was good. If you add toppings to the pizza then it is expensive. The server was really friendly and great service. This place is much better than the prince pizza couple of blocks away.

Kesté was recommended by a friend of mine. It's not "New York" pizza. It's Neapolitan pizza, so this is not the place for you if you're looking for New York pizza - because I made that mistake BUT Keste is surprisingly very delicious. Based upon the host's recommendation, I ordered the most popular, signature pizza: keste! Go figure! It's tomato sauce, imported buffalo mozzarella, prosciutto di Parma, arugula, gran cru pecorino, basil, made with extra virgin olive oil. What's great about Keste is that they offer a nice section of gluten free options.

This location is very small, so be prepared to wait for a table. We were informed that the Fulton location is much larger and can accommodate large parties. The service was on point. Everyone was friendly and professional. Prices are a bit high... my pizza was $21. And yes, I easily finished it myself. If you're in the neighborhood, definitely check out Keste. I noticed a Michelin Award in the window :)

In the midst of all the best pizza places in New York, there's Keste... Don't let this first sentence fool you... Keste is within one of the best pizza places in New York hands down, but not your average New York pizza though (or dough). Keste is true Italian pies with true fresh toppings.

You will not find your classic pepperoni or Hawaiin pizza here. Only the best of the best and some of the most exotic combination are available.

My friend told me to expect a wait but on a Wednesday night in the village, we were just walking in and been seated at a table in front of where all the magic happens.

I went for the pistachio and salsichi pizza and my friend for the Burrata truffle pizza. I'm a big truffle fan so we needed to share. We agreed on 50-50 but soon after I tried mine, that deal was down the drain. Although his was very flavorful, mine was an explosion that I have never received on a pizza.
In the beginning I was a tad dissappointed to see that the crust wasn't very cripsy but the tast was just perfect.

Service and atmosphere are amazing too.

The Kesté experience and pizza cannot be beat! Their ingredients could not be more fresh - the tomatoes, meats, motz, basil it all is supreme.
Their Margherita pizza melts in your mouth, and the sauce is to die for.  What makes Kesté so special and such a joy to visit though,  is the service and kindness.  Vito is wonderful, and wants you to enjoy! He makes you feel incredibly welcome, and treats you like family.
It is this service, and delicious food, that keeps New Yorkers and neighborhood locals coming back time and time again.
PS try the NUTELLA dessert pizza - it will also rock your world!

The pizza was delicious! We had the gluten-free pistachio & sausage pizza and the gluten-filled margarita pizza; both were delicious. Service was prompt, and the prices were very reasonable at lunch time. This may be the best pizza we've ever had.

I cannot say enough good things about Kesté. Not only is their food amazing, but their staff is professional and kind. I recently had an issue with a Kesté order through Seamless (it was a Seamless issue and not an issue with Kesté), but Kesté called me to see what had went wrong and offered to make the issue right, which I had no expected at all and was very impressed by. Their gluten free pizza is especially amazing. I have a gluten allergy and looked for just-as-good-as-normal pizza for years. Nothing beats Kesté's gluten free pizza. My boyfriend, who was born and raised in Italy, said it was the best pizza he's ever had (talking about the gluten free version). If you're in NYC, you must check out Kesté!

I love their $5 Margherita pies :) One of New York's best value deals for Neopolitan pizza. Service is fast. The sauce is excellent as well . This is my favorite insider lunch in Greenwich Village if someone is coming from out of town and wants a cool real Italian pizza experience.
