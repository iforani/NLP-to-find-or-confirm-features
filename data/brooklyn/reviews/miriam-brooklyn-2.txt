Came here for dinner on a Thursday night. We were a party of 4 seated immediately. We shared the Dipping Plate (comes with the house flatbread), and I had the fried brussel sprouts and the fried halloumi cheese & artichoke heart salad (vegetarian). The salad had the perfect amount of dressing and I'm not usually a fan of raw mushrooms but these were alright. The fried brussel sprouts were amazing (make sure you mix it up cause there's some yummy honey vinegar that collects at the bottom). The house flatbread was delicious with the za'atar seasoning and most of the dips (tahini and tzatziki) were delicious too. The butternut squash dip didn't have much flavor but the tatbelah (green dip) was a kick of garlicky-tangy flavor to the mouth...maybe a bit too much.

The timing of the dishes was weird. They take a while to prepare the food so be patient. The waiter told us he'd bring the dipping plate out first but we ended getting the main dishes for 3 of our party first. Unfortunate because the 4th person without food was my partner and he felt it was totally justified to mooch off my plates. Then we got the dipping plate and I was able to distract him with that. But then he was back to stealing my food until finally his dish came (and not a moment too soon!).

Heard this place is bopping for brunch so I'll be trying that next!

COVID times assessment: Menu by QR code, hand sanitizer at your table, and plenty of space between tables. Even though we were seated at the sidewalk, the outdoor seating is on a side street (not on the much busier 5th ave) so it feels roomy. They had a live band playing on the sidewalk too (at least when we went on Thursday)!

That line in the front even during Covid times... yea it's for a reason. I went for brunch and tried the green and "regular" shakshuka. Both were delicious but I prefer the sweeter taste of red Shashuka - the green tomatoes (maybe season) lacked flavor to me.

I had a really solid dinner at Miriam. It closes at 9pm on Saturday nights, and I had placed an order for pickup because I wasn't going to be able to get there until a few minutes after 9. When I arrived, I saw that they have a lovely outdoor seating setup and asked if I could stay to eat, which they allowed. Our food had already been packaged up in to go containers, so it was low maintenance on their part. The brussel sprouts were amazing and I'm sure that they would have been even better had we had them closer to when they were cooked. The babaganoush was also very good. The hummus was decent, but had a little too much liquid sitting on the top. Unfortunately, we had ordered the flatbread but they were out of it so they gave us some pita instead which was tasty.

Miriam was very serious about COVID precautions and every waiter was wearing their masks correctly. The tables were adequately spaced out.

Overall, it was a really cute vibe and I hope to come back and actually have the full dine in experience here!

Miriam does simple food well and they run a tight brunch ship. If you, like me, think brunch is lame and want something a little more substantive or inspiring other than eggs and buttered starch for breakfast, you'll be pleased to know that Miriam does offer some real food during weekend lunch hours, like soups, salads, sandwiches, and schnitzels. I got the yellow split pea soup, which was the soup of the day, and the Greek salad that had feta and wrapped grape leaves. The split pea soup was smoky and savory in all the right ways and now I want that recipe!

They have a lot of different types of seating, and some spots have heat lamps. Come before 11 since the lines get crazy otherwise.

I had been here once many years ago and wasn't particularly impressed and my friends have also had mixed experiences. This time I enjoyed the food and the music but service was slow and not as attentive as we would have liked.
The eggs florentine was good but needed salt and the salad was barely dressed. I did like that there was a lot of lettuce though!
The sabich was better than I expected and I was happy the eggs could be poached and not just hardboiled. The eggplant was perfectly cooked and not too greasy. The pickles were crunchy and flavorful and the hummus a lovely smooth mixture. I especially enjoyed the green tahini dipping and that the server offered us more pita(unsure if we were charged because service was slow and I had to run out!)
The first table we sat at had not been sanitized yet so we had to switch but when we came back the table was still dirty and there were pickles on the floor.
We sat under the speaker purposely and enjoyed the soul and motown tunes.
There were some delays in getting water, the meal took close to 20 minutes and we got utensils after the food came.
My friend had been the week prior and said service was super fast so I will give it another try.
We sat on the sidewalk but they also had the street seating.

I came here excited for Israeli food. Upon arriving, I waited 20 minutes in line for a seat without a host or anyone to let us know/guide us about our ETA and how seating works. We eventually sat down and ordered, and I hoped that the food would be worth it after reading the reviews. The shakshuka was average and the portion was very small for the price tag of $18. Two of my friends ordered omelettes - the server messed up the order (they had asked for no potatoes due to strict dietary restrictions and still were served potatoes instead of salad). The side of Israeli salad was also the size of a sampler. Overall, the food itself was very subpar and expensive. They have outdoor dining, but it will take a while to get a seat. Not worth it, and definitely not true Israeli food or hospitality.

I love this place. It's been around forever! I loved coming here when I lived in BK and recently gathered friends for some holiday shopping. It's authentic, welcoming, and delicious but you need to put in your name and come back in an hour (if you are lucky).

We snagged some seats at bar after 30min.  We still had another 40mins to go for a table.

We toasted with Bellinis and hard ginger kombucha (tasted like a cider & similar alcohol content). We opted for classic shakshuka, mushroom omelette, and Israel breakfast. We were all happy with our choices.

It's worth a visit if you are in neighborhood but have a plan so you aren't surprised by the wait.

Came from brunch on a Saturday at noon and was quoted a 45 minute wait. The weather was nice, so the wait wasn't bad. I noticed that this place does clear up a lot around 1pm (brunch lasts still 4pm).

I had the Norwegian eggs while my friends had the chicken schnitzel and the chicken Schwarma. We shared a side of hummus and fried eggplant. While the eggs I had were good, I couldn't get over how below average the hummus was. It just didn't taste fresh at all.

I also had some really burnt potatoes for my dish. There was another person in my party that also ordered the Norwegian eggs and her potatoes were burnt as well.

I would come back and try the rest of the menu but would definitely not get the hummus again because I don't want to be disappointed

Great food with limited but very authentic dishes. The right place for egg lovers. I was in a mood of kabobs, so order chicken sheekh kabobs, which was delicious and very nicely marinated with the Mediterranean spices. We also enjoyed green sauce and mango chatni sauce with hummus. Chicken kabobs served on the flatbread with the layer if spinach (could be more cooked or softer) and yogurt sauce. We asked for some hot sauce which was yummy and fresh. Another dish was served with an excellent presentation in a round bowl called Sabeh platter was good too, and basically, it's a vegetable dish.
The service was excellent, and we loved the outdoor seating. Price was a bit high but still worth trying, and we will recommend this place with family and friends.

Have been wanting to try this place forever. I eventually decided to order for delivery during covid and was not disappointed at all. Looks like they now have a lot of outdoor seating so I'm excited to check it out for dine in. Everything came on time, correct order and kept well during delivery. It's clear this is a step up from the tons of Mediterranean take out places nearby. The ingredients were top notch. I went with the chicken shawarma and the Brussels sprouts, which were amazing with their chili glaze. My girlfriend went with the braised short rib which was extremely tender and very flavorful. Will be back again for sure.

Miriam is a very cute place, but the food wasn't something I'd rave about. I went for brunch and got the Eggs Florentine. The hollandaise sauce was not tasty and the food overall was bland. However, the service was very good and the ambience was great.

Okay, AMAZING!! This food was just amazing. Go here!!

We got the:

Israeli Breakfast
two eggs (any style) with Labneh cheese, home fries, Israeli salad & pita

Burekas
puffed pastry pocket stuffed with feta & olives, served with two eggs (any style), Labneh cheese, Israeli salad & tahini sauce

I was a little worried because I don't love olives but the Burekas seems like it would be amazing. The olive flavor was very tame. The pastry was soft, moist.. just wonderful.

The portions are really good sized for the cost, and it was just so good!!

My star rating:
5  - you have to go!!!
4 - you won't be disappointed
3  - it was okay
2  - I probably won't go back
1  - turnaround and run

This place is AMAZING. I rarely venture out to Brooklyn but I would definitely make the trip just for this place.

I got the Mediterranean Cripsy Dough for brunch and omg am I glad I did. The crispy dough was perfect. The eggs were delicious and well seasoned but not overly so. The sauces on the side were different but not unpleasant. I especially enjoyed the red/pinkish one which was a fresh Tomatoe base but mixed with some other kind of ingredient.

This place gets crowded so definitely make a reservation! Service is a little slow.

I had mixed feeling about Miriam. We ordered from them once and we were blown away by their food. The Chicken Shwarma dish was absolutely wonderful! A little bit on the pricer side, we decided to visit it during brunch the following weekend. A little bit disappointed by their overall food. We ordered the Omlete croissant sandwich and I couldn't finish it because it was so bland and dry. I would probably still try it since - it was during covid times and a lot of places have changed their chefs.

Pretty pricey for a vegetarian brunch, but so intricately delicious and delightful that I was happy to pay $18 for 2 scrambled eggs, an Israeli bagel, a few pickles, tomato slices, and avocado... Generally I have a pretty big appetite, especially at brunch after a night of drinking, so I didn't expect to be full after eating such a delicate meal... to my surprise, I was so satisfied after savoring each bite that I didn't need to become "full" and finish my eggs or the bagel... Thanks for being so good you saved me from overeating, Miriam! See you again soon :)

My friend and I came here for brunch a few weeks ago. We got there around 1:30pm on a Sunday and were able to get a table for 2 outside (without a wait) to enjoy the good weather.

We shared a side of the potato pancake and it was so good. (Might get one for myself next time!) We also both got the Norwegian eggs Benedict, which sounded especially appealing because it was served on zucchini cake. The salmon was fresh and I enjoyed it a lot with the zucchini cake. Definitely coming back!

I had a long wait which is understandable given the times. I thought about going somewhere else, but I am glad to have stayed for brunch. I had the Norwegian eggs and thoroughly enjoyed them. My girlfriend had potato pancakes which also were great. I look forward to coming back soon and trying more dishes.

My Wife and I came here for a early dinner. The ONLY thing on the menu that was tasteful was the Raspberry Lemonade.  My wife had the Fish, flavorless even the mashed potatoes needed season. I order the Lamb, rice was undercooked and instead of Lamb the gave me chopped steak. NEVER EVER AGAIN. I WISH I COULD GIVE THIS PLACE HALF A STAR

I've walked passed Miriam many times but never stopped inside. A bunch of my friends decided to have brunch here on a Sunday and we were told by the host that it would be about a 15 minute wait. Well, half an hour later, we were still waiting to be called and seated, even when there were multiple empty tables inside. We had to wait outside because the restaurant is narrow and there is no space to stand inside.

When we finally got seated, we had a very nice waitress. I had the shakshuka, which I was underwhelmed by. It just tasted like salsa from a can. I much prefer the shakshuka from Nish Nush, which has more flavor and a kick to it. I was disappointed. I will say I liked the hummus though. Sad to say, I don't think I'll be returning here.

2/8/2020Hi April,
Thank you for visiting us and your review. I was sorry to hear of your experience. We do our best to seat guests ASAP as it is in everyones interest. Sometimes it is very difficult to gage turnover.
Many of our guests complain that they see empty tables when they are asked to wait which is understandable. We employ a wait list that enables us to text guests on that list and many do not stay at Miriam's. We allow for a 10m window for them to respond or show up and then move to the next guest if they don't show up. In the interim tables can be empty.
Both our Shakshuka's are best seller's and we don't tend to get complaints about them. They are both made with fresh ingredients, on the spot and can be spiked with our homemade Harrisa. I hope we get another opportunity to host you at Miriam's.

The food arrived on time and was either cold or frozen. None of the dishes matched the photos of "Miriam at home". The 4 oz fish portion had no additional vegetables, the 6 oz short rib ragu came without polenta/mashed potatoes, the 7 1/2 oz rice came without any herbs or spices on top. No sides were included as shown in photos on line. The babaganoush and bread were as expected. The meal had to be heated. This was a very disappointing experience. We feel that we were mislead on almost every item! This this restaurant usually is much better and a delightful place to eat but not recommended now.

Yum!

I've wanted to come to Miriam for a while and finally came here for Sunday brunch.
This place is great and the food is delicious!

Its a Mediterranean spot but they also have brunch classics like eggs Benedict (and Florentine and Norwegian)

I always crave Israeli food and honestly, I would order everything from the menu. Everything sounds mouth watering to me and there is no doubt I would come back and even order a delivery.

We got the fired dough (also known as malawach) its basically a puff pastry pancake, on the denser side. Its a little bit sweet and it comes with grated tomatoes, harissa/ schug hot pepper paste/sauce, and eggs. Traditionally you eat it with a hard boiled egg but we decided to go for over easy.
It was really good! I would recommend this dish!

We also got the burekas breakfast. Comes with eggs any style, Israeli salad and labane with za'athar and olive oil. The burekas is a puff pastry - super fluffy and delicious. This one was with cheese filling. The labane was really good too. Highly recommend this

Also decided to get a side of falafel which was sooo good and a potato pancake which was just okay. Honestly the breakfast was very filling on it's own, but I had to try the falafel

I would definitely come for lunch/ dinner as well!

Staff was attentive and quick!

Don't walk, run! Loved this place

Excellent flavorsome and filling brunch!! I got the Burekas ($17, a bit pricey but I guess that's NY for you) which was served on a big plate and included scrambled eggs (cooked perfectly), a tomato-cucumber salad, (not sure if it's Israeli) yogurt with good-quality olive oil + dried spices, a green tahini sauce (mild and fresh-tasting) and of course those flakey olive-feta filled pastries! I haven't had Israeli food before this but I could tell the meal was prepared with quality ingredients. Everything tasted freshly made and I greatly enjoyed the textures and flavors on my plate.

Came as a party of two on a Saturday around 10:30AM and it took a bit for us to get seated even though there were plenty of open tables indoors. It was actually quite dark inside so we chose to sit by the open windows. My friend got their fried crispy dough, which for the same price was surprisingly minimal-- two sauces and two poached organic eggs on top of the thinly stretched out dough. I got to try a piece of the fried dough and it was surprisingly savory (not just flavorless bread)! I don't think our waitresses were very attentive to us after serving the food. I found a thin thread of white string in my tomato-cucumber salad but left it on a napkin and continued eating.

We also ordered a side of pancakes (which only comes with a pad of butter and maple syrup) + paid extra for fresh berries (raspberry, blackberry, blueberry) but this was a BIG DOWNER. Took the pancakes to-go as we were in a rush to leave and ate them the next day. Wow, are these pancakes very lackluster. First, they were dry (didn't look special when they were originally served) and super overpriced. $5 for one small pancake that tasted like it was made out of a box and what's worse is that the tiny handful of berries we got cost us $7. $7 for NOT FRESH berries that had mold on one raspberry. Unfortunately we didn't have the chance to complain about this as we were just visiting NY for the weekend.

We came for brunch and ended up waiting close to an hour. They said it would be 30 min, when we got the text to come back. When we arrived exactly 2 minutes after getting the text, they didn't have a table for us. We said we would wait longer if we could get a table outside, which the waitress promised, but we ended up being crammed into a corner spot inside. The food was fresh and flavorful.

Overall: 4/5. Good food, mediocre service.

Miriam is easily one of the top brunch spots in park slope. All the food I have had is great. My favorites are definitely the boreka breakfast and the schnitzel sandwich. The boreka breakfast really has a nice balance of everything you would want in an Israeli breakfast while the schnitzel is cooked to perfection. One thing to note is if it are having an espresso based coffee drink, get it in early- I think they have only one machine so it can take a little while to get your coffee.

Also, they don't take brunch reservations so make sure to show up early as you probably will wait 15-30 mins depending on your group size. I would not come here with more than 4 people if possible. I have not come here for dinner yet but wave to try it at some point. All I know is their brunch is definitely worth the visit

I ordered mezze plates- falafel and a lamb dish. The sauces complemented the dishes perfectly. I also liked how the tables were arranged for social distancing with plexiglass dividers. Class act in my book.

Adorable Spot in Park Slope. Sit outside if it's a sunny day as the trees and flowers give it an amazing feel.

You can tell a place is good by their hummus which I thought was solid here. We had gotten Shashuka and Chicken Schnitzel Sandwich (why I chose this when there are so many other options is beyond me. I wanted something fried). Both were tasty. The bread was a little tough on the sandwich but that presentation is unbeatable. Service was a little slow- 40 min to get our food. But I do sympathize as there were quite a few patrons on the sunny day.

Overall a very solid choice for Park Slope area. It's a little pricey for what it delivers but again, welcome to Park Slope.

Came her on a Friday night because were in the area. The food was great! I got Mediterranean seafood dish and it was great! My love got the lamb shawarma and it was ok. I loved the ambiance and I think this is a really nice place to have a date night or a girls night. It was quiet enough to talk and have a conversation. Service was great! Food was great! Loved it!

I've been to Miriam several times at it offers a taste of Israel here in Brooklyn. I've been to Israel as have most people in my life, and this is where we've come to scratch our Mediterranean itch.

In general, Miriam has good offerings, but I've noticed quality slip a bit since beginning to come. My experience last night was underwhelming in particular. It was pretty clear that the cauliflower, hummus, flatbread with Za'atar, and pita had been sitting out far too long prior to being served, though the flavors were as expected. The oil had settled on the bottom of the cauliflower, and the flatbread was an unfortunately lukewarm cracker by the time it got to us. The lamb shawarma that we ordered to split was served hot and was good, but lukewarm pita detracted from the experience. Service was attentive and the outdoor seating was a nice local, but the food should star here.

I'm hoping this experience isn't a sign of true decline, because I've been recommending this place for years to friends and family. I hope that my next visit will prove to be a bit more hot from the kitchen.

Good food, terrible delivery. ALWAYS. Just had to cancel an order that was nearing 2 hours late. When I said that I wanted to cancel, here are two words I didn't hear: I'm sorry. If the food is late and the staff is apathetic, then it's me who's sorry because I'm out.

Miriam is my favorite brunch spot in Park Slope. I am sure others agree too as it is always packed, and wait to be seated.
But, once you are seated service is great and food is delicious.
I ordered Blueberry Pancakes, a side of Home Fries and freshly squeezed Orange Juice. Our table had also other orders such as Red Shakshuka, and 2 Eggs. Everything we ordered was very delicious and absolutely worth the wait. Food was 10/10.
It is a little noisy but not too crazy.
Service was great.

My husband and I came to Miriam today for brunch. The food was not only very tasty but also had a very good flavor to it. Their Jerusalem bagel was really tasty with the scrambled eggs that I had. I also had a side of their French toast with halva which I generally wouldn't eat but I actually really enjoyed it in this instance. My husband had a vegetable soup and really enjoyed it as well. We definitely would come back for brunch again.

We love this local Park Slope restaurant - they offer a fantastic brunch, but we've been relying on them for dinner takeout over the last few months. Each entree (like the shwarmas and schnitzel) easily lasts 2-3 meals! Our family has someone with a sesame (tahini) allergy, so we typically avoid Middle Eastern restaurants. However, the Miriam team is so considerate of allergies (their website homemadebymiriam.com lists top allergens for their different menu items) and we've been able to enjoy many different menu items without incident.

Had a great Monday morning brunch here after my friend and I tried to go to Sweet Chick but it wasn't open yet. I'm so glad we ended up at Miriam as it's so much better anyway.
We went on MLK Day which a lot of people had off and while it was crowded, we still got a table.
My friend got the shukshuka and raved about it.
Prices were fine.
I had the eggs Benedict and it was so good. And I'm kind of an eggs Benedict snob. :)
Coffee was good. Would definitely go back.

We came here for breakfast with our mom and we had a great time. It was pretty empty when we came in on Tuesday morning. We were seated immediately. I ordered the challah french toast with a cappuccino. My mom ordered the herbed eggs with tea and my twin ordered the Israeli breakfast with regular coffee. We don't have any complaints about anything. The food was really good. Our waiter was attentive. I'd come back.

This is by far my favorite spot for breakfast. I recommend coming here closer to their opening time considering the wait time. We come on a Friday morning to avoid it. The food is delicious always fresh and the waiters are very attentive. My usual is the burekas brunch meal and I never finish it, but it is sooooo delicious. We sometimes get the lamb sausage on the side, hummus or potato pancake. I'm not crazy about the pancake but everything else is amazing. I rate this spot 10/10. If you don't like something they will change it and offer you something else ( my husband didn't like the coffee so they offered a mocha latte and he said it was amazing ) great decor, great food and awesome vibe :)

Atmosphere is great, service is good but the food is really bad. it pains me to give a bad review because I love Mediterranean food.

Listen, I lived in the Middle East for 5 years and traveled all over including Africa, Greece etc and never in my life  I ate such a bitter and crappy Humus and a horrendous Shawarma like in this place.

For appetizers we asked for the flat bread which was ok, the humus Plate (terrible) and a salad which was good. Main entree we got the Shinitzel with mash potatoes and the lamb Shawarma.

The mash was tasteless but shinitzel was pretty good. I have no words for their version of  Shawarma.
I get that this neighborhood is yuppie and they try to look cool with "fusion" like plates. Presentation is important  no doubt but the taste is what really matters and they failed  miserably here.

The meat tasted like a washed up stew and smelled weird with an overpowering orange sauce. It was so bad that we were not able to eat much of the plate.

I give them props because the place was packed and everyone was buying their awesome decor and ambience but it doesn't work for me...  I rather seat in a hole in the wall with great food.
