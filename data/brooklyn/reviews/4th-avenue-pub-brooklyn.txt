Stopped by this Brooklyn institution this week for their 14th ( 14th!! ) anniversary.  What a great night.  Have not had the pleasure to be here since COVID closed so many of our favorite bars.  Epic draft list and safely managed social distancing.   Do be sure to check out their roadway seating annex - it reminded me of day drinking on the Champs - Elysees in my younger days.   Bring your best girl and make a day / night of it.  You'll be glad you did.

My best girl and I took our two angel-faces to Brooklyn - YES, that Brooklyn - to see Disney on Ice at the Barclay's Center.  After the performance, and what a performance it was, we made our way over to the 4th Avenue Pub.  What a great way to end the day!  We sat outside in their lovely garden on a beautiful Brooklyn evening.  They offered beers from all over the world, including some beers brewed right here in New York City.  If you ever find yourself in this section of Brooklyn, stop by for a great selection of beers served by a knowledgeable and caring staff.  You'll be glad you did.

I'm an avid popcorn lover and it's free! Free! Free! At this pub!

It's super cool and casual atmosphere, it seems small when you enter but has a lot of space sm seating on the inside as well as additional seating to the back on the outside.

There's a bay seasoning that you can add to your popcorn for a bit of diff flavoring. Music is at the right level where you can carry on a conversation without shouting. And there is a wide selection of beer and varying alcoholic beverages .

This is definitely a place to hang out at and it's in one of my favorite neighborhoods.

Will be back.

Wanted to like this place but had to leave before ordering anything. From the website and list they have tons of beer. Belgians seem specialty but draft list is large as well. We were feeling IPA and literally each of the 2 on draft and one in can we're gone. Good for macro selection but need to update the menu. Poor business when you don't have beers actively advertised on website and menu and even on chalkboard behind bar but can't deliver. Beers themselves sit at $7-10 it seemed.

FREE OLD BAY POPCORN!  What more do you need to read?  Are you kidding me! Stop reading this and just GO THERE!

As if the popcorn wasn't enough...this cozy little watering hole also has a fantastic beer selection.  The staff are engaging and friendly and know their beer stuff. There's also a nice outdoor seating area.

Are you still reading this?!  Jesus Christ, I need you to do better!  Go have a beer!  If you see me there...1st round is on me!

Cheers!

The bartender is super friendly here. They have free refills on soda. They also have free popcorn, which is nice. But someone noticed that someone stuck his hand in to get the popcorn instead of using the scooper so he decided to not get any more popcorn for our table. Always tip your bartender!

Props to the bartender-ess. Came here on a vfriday evening for a friends work happy hour. There ended up being 20 of us in the party, and probably another handful of people in the bar. They do not have pickle juice, which was my biggest turn off, no rounds of pickle backs for us. Bartender was so kind and handled the large group well! They have an adorable low key back patio area with lights and picnic tables. I was genuinely surprised They only staffed one person for a Friday night but I guess I don't know the area. The drinks are strong and cheap. No food. Good neighborhood spot if you're looking to get lit. Sign said open til 4am

Looks tiny from the door, but it has a decent amount of space as you move closer to the back.

I had rose as I'm not a big fan of beer. Note: if you LOVE beer this might be a cool place to try.

The interior is standard dive bar and the staff are dive bar attendee friendly.

Overall I'd come back here for a quick late night drink.

Great beer selection, free popcorn, outdoor seating.
Let me repeat: Great beer selection, free popcorn, and outdoor seating.
Do I need to even keep writing this Yelp review? What could make this even better? Old Bay Seasoning for the free popcorn.

4th Avenue Pub is clutch. They have an impressive beer list, is super nondescript though there were some hipsters inside who needed deoderant, and is not too crowded. If you come on a Friday night though, expect to stand because the table/booth seats are rare. I think I've found my new go-to bar.

Free popcorn! Old Bay seasoning available​!

This is a divey neighborhood spot with a great beer selection and a nice bartender. Friendly if you have questions about what's​ on tap and willing to make suggestions.​

Not a lot of room but that's​ usually fine as it's not usually packed.

There's​ a back area where you can drink and smoke I believe​.

I usually end weeknight drinking here so I can't speak to the weekends. If you're​ looking for that chill dive bar with lots of beer, this is it.

Great draft selection that appeals to craft and macro drinkers a like. They had sours, Smokey beers, New England IPAs and other flavor intense beers. On the other hand, they also had more session beers like a Hefeweizen or Oktoberfest that anyone could appreciate.

The bartender was one of the hardest working bartenders I've ever seen. He didn't have a second to relax. They have free popcorn to enjoy alongside your drinks.

4th Ave is a super solid neighborhood pub.  It's a little campy--but in a quiet little bar way--the lights are low, and there are movies playing in the background--and the bathroom has a chalkboard and chalk for your finest thoughts.  The bathroom, by the way, was clean.

I arrived early for a date, and the pub was pretty empty, but by 6:30 it was starting to fill up with the post-work crowd.  We still had no problem getting a small table, and when I went back for a second round, the bartender immediately acknowledged me with a, "Be with you a minute," even though the bar was full.

I'm not a beer drinker, but my cocktail was made well, and was DIRT CHEAP, Y'ALL. A round of drinks for two for ten bucks is nothing to turn up your nose at, especially when the drinks are strong, cold, and immediate.

I wish the music had been a little more quiet, because the other patrons were more loud to compensate, but it's a small complaint.

I'm definitely taking 4th Avenue Pub on a second date.

Came after the Islanders game reading the sign that Ommegang Wittes were $2 off until 2 hours before and after the game. I don't think they have food but have pretty decent self serve popcorn with basic toppings you can sprinkle on. It was a full house. They only really disappointing thing was that at the end, the bartender didn't give us the discount that drew us into the bar. It was busy and a couple of dollars, so we gave a minimal tip and left it at that. Probably a little weary to come back, as we're a huge fan of Pacific Standard next door.

12/4/2017Thanks for the five stars! Amazing! As for the cask issue, we are not a “No Cask” bar, but rather a “Sometimes Cask” bar. In recent years the availability of great cask offerings in the format that we carry (pins rather than firkins) has dwindled considerably. We are constantly on the look out for new offerings but it has become more difficult. That said, with the winter months upon us we may see some change. Check out our BeerMenus listing to see if anything comes up: beermenus.com/places/278… Cheers & thanks for stopping by! Don’t be a stranger!

4th Ave Pub is a deceptively good beer bar.  It looks like a random ass bar from the outside; walking in, at a glance they have some decent draft options but the place is a little run down.  However look closer at the tap list and the bottle menu, and you'll start to like the place more.  The tap list is full of worthwhile options, while the bottle list has some gems if you look hard.  I got Fullers 1809 old ale for like $9 for a bottle.  That's a steal at a beer store, let alone a bar.

After a few beers, the place becomes a bit more charming.  Bartenders are very good and they don't let beer just sit around like some places.  There is a small backyard area too, not to mention free popcorn.  I wouldn't rank this above St. Gambrinus nearby, but this is a good #2 option for this area.

This is a great bar for happy hour. The bar itself has a lot of personality, as do the bartenders that work here. They have lots of sass. Don't dare getting his attention during a crowded happy hour if you don't know what you want. The guy next to me got "yelled" at. It was funny to watch.

The happy hour deal is $1 off all drinks, which is minimal but still a deal. The place was fairly quiet when I walked in around 6, but by 6:30 it was packed and loud and very, very busy. It quieted down a bit by 7:30-7:45 when much of the crowd headed over to the Barclay's Center for the evening's festivities.

The pub is definitely in the perfect location for a pre-concert or pre-sporting event drink or two. The beer selection is vast, and there's a ton on tap. (Stay away from the wine, it wasn't good. But I should've known...)

Beware: they do not serve food here, but you can bring in whatever you want or order from their big binder of delivery menus.

Plus: The free popcorn is a great bar snack and they even offer up some old bay seasoning to spice up your life. ;)

"Free popcorn!"
That was all my friend had to say and I was down to come here.
4th Ave Pub is a cute bar with great outside area. Super convenient location. My cocktail was a little watered-down but it was also a little cheaper than normal. And the popcorn got better and better with each tray!
Random fact: the bathroom is painted in chalkboard paint and there's a tray with chalk. Maybe this isn't the most sanitary activity, but it's a fun idea.

Funny how much one's preferences can change with time--now that I've been in Brooklyn for almost two years, everything about my previous review is pretty much the reverse.  I can't tell you when's the last time I went to Pac Standard (maybe I tired of the pricey wells or of my friend always wanting the terrible nachos), but I go to 4th Ave. more or less weekly, most often to wrap up my night when I want just 1 (or 2) more drinks, a little popcorn to soak it all up, and the company of the best crew of regulars and awesome bartenders I've encountered since moving here.  Beer selection's still great, and they're ALWAYS willing to put the game on those tiny TVs.

Great beer selection and free popcorn, like everyone says.

That said, every time I go, I promise I'll never go back, but I live so close by that it just happens, you know?  The place is just so painfully hipster.  Tiny tv in the corner showing Quentin Tarantino movies--who hasn't seen that gimmick before?  Once, I came in to have a beer and popcorn while catching the end of a football game, and, to their credit, they had it on . . . , but they had it on the Spanish feed (which I understand and is fine, but . . . just . . . why?!?!?).

Pacific Standard for me . . . until the next time I want popcorn and happen to have cash.  Sigh.

Really like the bar next door, yet really wanted to try this place too. A solid selection of craft beer, chill atmosphere, and free popcorn!

Saturday mid-afternoon and almost no one inside. Good variety of beers on draft ranging from $6-10 and a bunch of bottles/cans. A few specialty cocktails are available at a decent price ($8-12). Bartender lady is super friendly and seems to know the locals around here. Popcorn is located at the end of the entrance hall with red plastic bowls on top and a thin scooper to the left of the machine. Solid, no frills popcorn for an equally no frills bar.

No food here (aside from the popcorn) and I can see how it can get crowded fast. Good place to meetup with friends for a couple drinks.

Best neighborhood bar EVER. All the bartenders rock. Especially Garrett, his Tuesday and Thursday night playlists are the SHIT!!! He's lovely and pours the best drinks. The drinks are always cold, the atmosphere lively and the popcorn fresh. They also have a delightful backyard, now that it's summer it should be enjoyed.

Always love coming in for a round, or 3.

4th Avenue Pub is my favorite place to get free popcorn. I don't know if I know any other place that gives free popcorn, but this is easily my favorite.

I've spent many of happy hours, birthday parties, bar crawls, and end of the night stops that I shouldn't have done, at 4th ave Pub. It's pretty consistent.

First off you have a large selection of beer. Now, while some places have tons of options, half of them will be of the same type of beer. Not here. It's a pretty good mix of brews, all varying in type.

I enjoy writing cryptic and odd messages on the chalk wall bathroom. My favorite is to ease drop on a neighboring conversation and then proceed to the bathroom, to write something in relation on the wall. Messing with strangers is fun. Yes, Ted is sleeping with his secretary.

The bartenders are pleasant and friendly. They know how to make basic drinks the proper way. I have to say though, I've never had a good share of buy backs, despite the fact I always tipped well here. Might just be their policy.

There is a good sized back yard with lots of benches and picnic tables. Get a spot early, it gets packed if the weather is nice. Note though, the sun isn't out that much due to the angles of the buildings nearby.

Lastly, and most importantly, there is free popcorn. Whether it's being eaten, thrown at someone, or used to plot your domination over the world, it's free and that can not be ignored.

This is a hidden cheap spot! If you want a dark dive like  bar with free popcorn... you got it. We would always look for a place that will always close at 4am and this was it. Drinks are $5 normally.... they also have happy hour but it's only a dollar off. It's kinda of a dive bar but they have a garden thAt pretty well kept.

We were walking by seeking a local watering hole, when the rep for Troegs Brewing (Gil) started talking to us outside 4th Avenue Pub.  They were releasing their nugget nectar ale at 4th Ave, and he told us we should stop in because the beer is amazing.  He also gave us a kick-ass Troegs poster.  Upon entering, we discovered an amazing beer selection.  We got samples of a few beers that were served in tiny little glasses with cute handles that looked like you should hold your pinkie in the air while you sipped out of them.  4th Ave has a great divey atmosphere and had one of the best playlists that I have ever heard in a bar.  I was in 90's music heaven: Natalie Imbruglia to Blackstreet and everything in between.  My ears and my tastebuds were in heaven.

3.5 stars...

The reason this place has such impressive ratings is because of their relatively wide selection of craft brews on tap and bottles. That and the free popcorn (apply your own salt and/or Old Bay), and back patio.

For me I care more about my calorie intake and budget so although a tasty craft brew is nice from time to time, a $3 Miller Light would make me more satisfied. Drafts start at $6. There's one $5 draft (Woodchuck Cider) or so I thought until the bartender charged me $6 for it and I didn't feel like bringing up the possible typo in their menu.

Their backyard has ridiculously high concrete walls and a complete tree covering so it feels a little dark and cave like but I'm happy with any place that has a decent sized yard with lots of tables (in this case picnic tables).

Overall as someone not concerned with finding a place with lots of craft brews I wasn't wowed by this place but should I want to go out with a beer connoisseur I'll certainly know a decent place to take them.

Free popcorn! Backyard!

Lots of beer options here, as well as a full bar. Don't come for a fancy cocktail- this is not the spot. Do come for beer, popcorn, and a rum and coke. I assume they let you take takeout here if you want to order a pizza with your drinks. Seems like the type of spot to do that.

They DO play football games but the televisions are very small and the CC is jambled, which makes for an entertaining game.

The bathroom in the back is also very, very spacious. The walls are chalkboard, so feel free to write your name, or challenge someone to tic-tac-toe.

Nearly 2yrs ago this female bartender named Brigette told me that I cannot "talk about politics" in here. I told her "Who the hell are you to tell me what I can talk about?" She walks away. I was having a very civil conversation with two guys, no problem, no fight, they were 2 Bernie supporters and I was explaining why I'm voting for Trump. I hadn't been to the bar since, there are other places to go, but I happened to swing through tonight and Ralph says that I'm 86'd from here. Lame. Liberals are the REAL fascists. I'm pretty center-right, reasonable, Libertarian minded but these young people will just shut you down blindly if they THINK they are hearing something against their acceptable narrative. I'll take my money elsewhere. And Ralph, no one ever asked me to leave, no one ever told me to not come back, other than YOU, tonight. I guess being a VERY regular customer for more than 10yrs means nothing to you. And it's also a very old occurance. I'll spread the word around about this corny place.

Oh btw stop calling 911 when BLACK PEOPLE have some sort of disagreement in front of your bar.

P.S. Stop trying to remove my posts! Own up to my criticism of your business! After all, you took my money for more than 10yrs.

This is a cool place! Came here to meet friends on a Saturday afternoon. It wasn't overly crowded but still a decent amount of people there. Since it was still cold outside, I got a hot toddy. It was strong and tasted really good. I love that they have free popcorn to munch on! It's not buttered or salted but you can add your own toppings. I think it tasted good as is though. The bartenders are friendly and attentive; we didn't have to wait long for our drinks. The atmosphere is really chill and it's a great place to just hang out with friends and talk. Overall, solid option in the area if you're just looking for a nice place to relax and have a good drink!

Very confused about the high reviews. I left the bar after about only five minutes on a Thursday night due to how horrendously rude the bartender was. I wish I had caught his name to add on this review but honestly couldn't leave fast enough. He had a thick beard, about as much about him as I want to remember.

The bar was muggy, loud, and crowded. My friend and I were attempting to close our tab and gestured for the check. The bearded bartender sees us and ignores us. We wave again for his attention and he comes straight to us aggressively shouting, "NO, DON'T DO THAT. I'm a professional. Don't wave at me, I'm a professional."

No sir, apparently you are not. Professionals don't yell at their customers and throw a tantrum. We were very caught off guard by this hostility and needless to say, have zero plans on ever returning.

I literally live around the corner, so this is my go-to bar. Here's the breakdown of the three bars on this block:

1) Cherry Tree has a great backyard but crappy beer selection.
2) Pacific Standard has a great beer selection but no backyard.
3) 4th Avenue Pub has a great beer selection AND a great backyard seating area.

Another plus is that they serve Delirium Tremens and show IFC movies with no sound. Also, free popcorn and friendly bartenders. What more do you need?

What a gem! A group of 10-12 of us came in here on an okay (weather-wise) Saturday afternoon and were able to find ample seating in the back patio. The beer selection is stellar and affordable (I'm still getting used to those NYC prices...). The inside was dark and most of the seating was at the bar, but the place was clean and the bartender was friendly and ready with recommendations. Plus, free popcorn! I'd highly recommend this spot and will definitely be back myself!

Cool tunes, incredible beer selection, mellow vibe (in a good way!), cozy confines & friendly service.

What's not to love about this place? Not much.

This pub features a great beer selection which gets periodically updated.  Some beers get removed from the menu and some get added on, which can be a blessing and a curse. Personally, it was sad to see one of my faves, 'A Little Sumpin' Sumpin' Ale, no longer being offered the last couple of times I was here.

Decent in terms of prices, even with the top quality draft beers.

Complementary popcorn which you can season to your liking.  I have seen people order pizza from the outside.

Outside seating area. Perfect for enjoying your beer while having a smoke. Despite the 'No-Smoking' sign, everyone's lighting up.

Finally, a very nice, sophisticated crowd. Have yet to witness any rowdiness and I have been here on plenty of occasions.

Oh how I love 4th Ave Pub! More of a dive than Pacific Standard, it's perfect for a low key and very chill night. Plenty of seating with some booths that will fit groups of 6 and an absolutely gorgeous backyard with huge picnic tables. Amazing and varied selection of craft beers on tap which frequently rotate. For example: Smuttynose, Sly Fox, Founder's, Bell's, Delirium, and Lagunitas with many more. There's a huge craft bottle selection and there's always a cask too. Free popcorn makes this place a definite win!
