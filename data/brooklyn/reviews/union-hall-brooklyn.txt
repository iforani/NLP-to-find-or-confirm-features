What a fantastic place ! Vibe was right. Music was great. Service was fantastic. Decor was one of a kind. The manager rocks. There was something for everyone to do here. Great times!

Hmmm what else do you need?

Bocce, Beer and B... hmm, ah! Books!
Happy hour is $1 off well drinks, beer and wines from 4-7
food on the menu as well for happy hour.
couches in the front, the back and seating everywhere else. Downstairs you will find the unisex bathroom and another space with a bar for nights where there are performances. Parking is tough so Uber it or take the train that is one avenue away. Cool spot to hang with a group of peeps, play bocce or whatever.

Thank you to Union Hall and the staff for the great engagement party event on Saturday night for my daughter and her fianc√©. It went very smoothly thanks to planning with Naomi, the event contact, and all the staff involved. The platform in the back of the bar was perfect for the party - cozy and apart from the rest of the main bar area, and the bocce fields added additional entertainment. Food was very good as well.
Planning this from Virginia, we were hopeful that it was going to be all good, but it exceeded our expectations!  Thanks Union Hall!

BOCCE BALL!!! If you don't know what I'm talking about, you can literally google how to play the game two seconds before your turn and somehow master it in one go! Pro tip: get your team's ball closest to the small white ball without touching the back wall. That's all you'll really need to know to play the game. It will get competitive, it will get addictive, and it's even better with some alcohol.

Nice place for a drink!
They have at the back of thw bar few games to entertain yourself and the front very comfy sofas.
Service is fast and on a Saturday 5pm the bar was full but not crowded.
We were 6 adults and a 1.5yr old toddler and our kid was not a problem at all. Not sure about the kids policy. But at the entrance there is a sign that says no strollers (if you have those mini foldable is not a problem!)
So, place to either go for games while having a drinknor to have a drink and be able to actually have a conversation.
We like it.

Visited 'UH' a few days ago on a humble...
Heard a few good things but man,let me tell you this ...the space was really nice with a great vibe..
The bartender was so chill and she explained how to play the game of Bocce ball...
they have two lanes in the which I have never seen before in a local bar...
I was surprised on how much Real estate they took up considering most places would use the space for dining ..
But once we played our first game I definitely understood the method towards their madness..
Man did we have a blast...
Drinks were also great with a decent happy hour ..
I will definitely be going back for a rematch..

I came here by chance with a group of friends expecting nothing. The venue itself is gorgeous and the feel is extremely cozy. There are even working fireplaces! The prices are good for park slope. There music a little too mellow and slow beat. The french fries were alright and the drinks are strong.

Came here on a Sunday night after a wedding and it was so chill, loved the vibe -- not sure if I would still love it on another more crowded night. It was quiet and we played bocce ball in the back! Two bocce ball lanes! Comfy couches and table seating available as well.

OMG walked from corner to corner and cannot find this place! There are no signs that says "Union Hall" or anything and finally found it by the numbers "702".

Walked in and looked to my left and thought I was at a fancy library. Walked further into the bar and saw bocce ball, okay Hmmm not bad...

Stopped at the bar to get a drink and found that happy hour was $1 off of beers, mixed drinks, and wine. I'm a beer and wine drinker so I was excited to see there were local NY brews and unique ones that I've never tried. Not the typical Stella and Bud.

Since now I know where this place is, I'll be back with a group of friends!

Been coming here for years... But I'm not happy that they're putting the fruit straight in the drink instead of on the side...WTF. Not the bartender's fault, she's great, but apparently they were told they can't put slits in the fruit anymore so they have to throw it straight in...I don't like dipping my fingers in a drink to squeeze a fruit

I was at union hall recently and I witnessed who I overheard was a manager curse and yell at who appeared to be a staff member in front of a large group of customers who appeared uncomfortable after...

To be quite frank this is not the first time I've witnessed unprofessional behavior from management from union hall.

I'm pretty disgusted with this bar in general and it's vibe in the neighborhood.. this was the last straw. I will not be going back and I will be advising everyone I know not to go to this bar.

I'm a super fan. It's the cauc version of Bedford Hall, not sure which came first but I found this second and it's ok. I definitely liked learning the new bowling type of game they have. And, did Karaoke which was super fun. I'm going back for sure.

I don't review bars often because I think they can be very subjective due to personal taste in night life, but I really feel like this has to be 5 star spot for anyone who comes in. One of the only spots in Park Slope with a young crowd, the large space really has something for everyone. Lounge area with couches, huge bar, FREE bocce courts, private area for parties, and a basement that often hosts big name and up and coming comedians on the regular in a very intimate space. Really can't say enough good things about this iconic Brooklyn establishment

Bocce ball, comfy (yet sparse) seating areas, that young crowd that reminds you that you too used to enjoy drinking standing up- young ruckus downstairs and the best darn Long Island iced tea I've ever had. Also, pickle backs! A decent evening was enjoyed by most.

I very much enjoyed this bar. It has a "professors living room vibe" which I definitely dig. Any place that uses couches instead of tables and chairs always gets a big thumbs up in my book. The bar has bocce courts in it, although we couldn't play because there was a "tournament" going on (really, I think the people who got there before us just wanted to hog them and told us that because there was no evidence of a tournament - anyway, I digress).

The pricing was reasonable. The service was friendly. The only reason I don't give Union Hall 5 stars is because the food was "meh." The hummus was bland and the veggie burger I had was much like a million veggie burgers I've had in the past. I would recommend Union Hall for a fun night out with drinks and bocce ball, but maybe grab a bite somewhere else beforehand.

Ugh! A couples dream. This is a big place with all sorts of nooks and crannies for you to hide away in. The library walls adds a great touch.

If you find a seat on a Saturday night, consider yourself lucky. It's so much fun to sit back in a comfortable chair and watch people pass. (Is that strange, no, I don't know?)

The bartenders held it together pretty well on a crazy night. My friends drink was weak and after a comment to her, the bartender amped it up without even a question. She had a big smile on her face and appeared to want us to be happy.

The bocce is a blast and is ideal for couples and friends to compete against. It's a fun game that you can either play in or just watch for depending on how you're feeling. It's a giant game right in the middle of the bar. You won't miss it. Play a round to make the best of your time at Union.

Downstairs is a little crazy! It reminds me of a speakeasy... there was karaoke on a small stage. Of course you'd have to get up and boogie with the MC who was 6'0, bearded, and wearing a tutu. It's incredibly Brooklyn here. I'm glad I found this gem.

My partner and I came here to see a comedian, but she cancelled 30 minutes before the show. What a bummer.

We decided to make the most of the night and enjoy Union Hall for what it has to offer. A really lovely atmosphere, friendly bartender who gave us the $1 off beer deal even though it was past the HH time. Thanks!

We scored the seats next to the fireplace and in this brutal winter it was SO lovely. If I'm in the area again, I'd definitely end up here.

i came here for a comedy show in the basement but since we arrived a bit early, i got a round of drinks at the main bar. initially, the gentleman behind the bar seemed to be either really and quietly busy or meditating. one of the two but as soon as he noticed me, came up and was a friendly dude who took care of me and my friend.

the show started shortly after getting our drinks so we went to the basement. i forget the name of the comedians that evening but the show was fun. it was two ladies, so if you think that white men are an endangered species you probably wouldnt have liked it but whatever, chances are nobody likes you either.

after the show was over we came back up and saw a few kids wearing beanies bastardizing the game of bocce but you know, vegetarians who eat fish and chicken tend to fuck everything up.

four solid stars.

Union Hall has something for everyone.  Wanna cozy up in a library or a booth?  How about we play some indoor bocce*?  Or head downstairs for a comedy show** (complete with a downstairs bar)?  Love beer?  Union Hall is seriously my go-to place in Park Slope!

It feels so exclusive when there aren't any crowds but it still maintains that inviting and chill down-to-earth ambience regardless of the number of people.  The ground floor has an open layout, which I adore.  The only thing I probably love more than the layout are the bartenders.  My friend and I dropped by on a Saturday afternoon after brunch (heck yeaaah) and noticed a milk/coffee flavored draught.  Seeing our confusion, he happily brought a glass under the tap and offered us a sample.  That was so kind of him!

------

* Bocce is a ball sport played on a very long and narrow court that's covered with a thin layer of natural soil.  They have 2 courts laid side by side.  Two players/teams play per court as designated by the blue and red balls.  The white ball is the pallino (or boccino) and the goal is to get your ball as close to the white ball as possible.  I like to roll my ball to knock the pallino away from my friend's and closer to mine (hehe).  There's a fairly complicated point system that you can research online if you're interested in keeping score.

** They sell event tickets online at Ticketfly (and at the door).  Online tickets are cheaper when purchased at least 1 day in advance (was $6 vs $8 for my Battle of the Divas - Beyonce vs Lady GaGa - t'was a great night of comedy, drag queens, and lip syncing!).  I love how they have cups and water pitchers at the downstairs bar for people who aren't drinking alcohol.  Also, the bathrooms stalls downstairs are unisex so even if you see someone of the opposite sex, don't worry, you're in the right place!

A group of guys were cheating and disregarding the Bocce Ball sign up sheet to make sure no one outside of their group could. Normally I wouldn't complain about this since the bar isn't necessarily responsible for whatever jerks patronize their establishment, but these guys play on a league and clearly spend a lot of time here. One in particular, Andy, portrayed himself as a representative of the establishment inasmuch as continually insinuating himself into our game to declare the house rules, a surprise move since he'd previously failed to understand that joining his colleagues for a game even though he was clearly 5th on the waiting list after us wasn't very fair. We spent most of the game protesting for fairness and enduring a lot of confusion about rules. Andy encouraged his companions to "finish us off" at which point we decided to give up. It was a petty and disappointing scene. I'm embarrassed to have to even write stuff like this. Definitely not a very welcoming environment. Definitely kind of a bro club. Whatever. We'll take our business elsewhere.

Bocce Ball. Yes, really, Bocce Ball. Bocce Ball courts in this bar. How cool is that?

Well, how about -

Cocktails, leather couches, beer cheese, live bands, cool music, craft beer, bar eats menu, and fireplaces.

Union Hall is a 5000 square foot bar. They feature live music and comedy acts too.

The place itself is huge with a chill vibe. Bands play on the lower level. The decor all around is very cool and looks unlike most any bar. Kind of like a hipster version of an eccentric library.

Of course I had to check this place out when I was in the area recently. Of course I had to try out a cocktail called the "Bocce Ball" which was made with Maker's Mark.

Of course, I need to come back here one day but first I need to brush up on how to play Bocce Ball.

Admittedly, I wasn't sure what to expect when I walked in. There is a distinct hipster vibe, between the bookshelves, couches, indoor bocce lanes, and well-curated drink list, but honestly I was impressed. My experience was a bit different because I was part of a large party that had reserved the space in the back, but the food I tasted (bbq sliders, delicious hot wings, and french fries with creamy queso) was good enough for me to seriously consider coming back for more.

I was also really impressed with the drink selection, as I don't love beer, but they had several ciders and a wonderful sour on tap, which made me very happy. The bocce was a lot of fun (I had somehow never played before), and the music was on point.

I would definitely go back for more!

This is actually a review of the comedy club located at Union Hall.  We were extremely disappointed to find out the comedy show was in the basement.  First, you walk pass some huge garbage bins into a dark alley.  Then, you walk down a narrow staircase.  It was extremely crowded with no sprinkler system.  Possibly a fire hazard!  There were too many people and chairs in such a small venue.  People would not be able to leave this place safely in the event of an emergency. Comedy itself was okay.

You're at Union Hall with a salon of Brooklyn artists. They think it's cute that you're from LA, that you wear leopard print and black nail polish. It's much different than their sweater vests or norm core Adidas, their shorts and large hoodies. "You have bangs, I have bangs," you tell them. Get over the differences. Differences make the world go 'round.

You play lawn bowling indoors here and drink seven dollar beers. The best part about this place is that it's crowded, even on a weeknight. The taco truck just outside is decent, too. Seven dollar beers and a ten dollar burrito and you're officially living the Brooklyn artist dream, shoveling crunched bills onto the bar top, the ones from your barista job, twenty-percent-tips for the many five dollar lattes you make. The ones with the hearts and flowers. It's not what you're best at drawing. You're better at body parts. Fluid. Sad eyes, capturing mood. Your painting philosophy is to capture mood, be accurate in sadness, melancholy, and sleep with your subjects...no, that's not the right order. Paint what you love, who you've slept with. Yes.

You like Union Hall. It's not something you'd paint, but you remember your first night here with Leine, you said, "Not much going on in Park Slope," and she went on to name every city in the globe. It was where to go next. Irony was you were happy here with her just the same. It wasn't until she'd talk about work and money that you'd begin to freak out about life. That she didn't share the same values with her being set on masturbating her clients. She gave you a new perspective on sex work. She said, what's the difference between what she did and what your cohort does, prostituting your souls perhaps is worse...what you'd all do to sell paintings...it's true. But it's nothing you're proud of, you said, and there was the impasse.

Union Hall's beer list is good. The Brooklyn breweries and that the bars are open late here, is good. As well as the room downstairs, you've attended a few readings...one time music. Tonight everyone seems to be tired-happy, arguing about form matching content and how good artists go against the grain...that when things are done intentionally is all that matters. For instance, wearing a t-shirt to a gala. Only sometimes a faux pas. But what about a tuxedo, here?

You picture Leine in a formal dress and she'd sit on a Union Hall couch, the tufted one, and how tragic it looked and how tragic it all is. She shaved her head. You're losing your hair. You're here at Union Hall with a different set of people entirely. No one to hold onto at night when your stomach is full of burrito, and your once full heart is aching and sore. From all that holding on to a dream.

So many things to say. Very cool interior upstairs, a rad karaoke night downstairs on Fridays, and lots of spots to sit. An overall chill bar ONCE THEY GET RID OF THEIR ASSHOLE DOORMAN.

As other reviews have stated, "the heavier, lighter skinned African American doorman" is an outright ass hole. I know doormen don't have the easiest of jobs, but there was no excuse for this guy acting the way he did.

After leaving the bar to smoke, I had forgotten my ID inside, and after telling him the situation upon reentering- he just shrugged without looking at me so I took that as his indifference and go to get my ID, walk three steps into the bar and he shouts at me "GET THE FUCK OUT OF THE BAR! GET. THE. FUCK. OUT." at least five times and aggressively bounces on his feet in front of me looking like he's ready to make this physical. Like a 5'5" girl is going to start a fight with him???

A terrible experience. The bouncer earlier in the night was very professional, so I don't know how this other guy still even works there. Disappointing, especially since there are several reviews about him.

Ive never written a yelp review but I had to just to express how unprofessional and irrational this guy was. For the sake of those who still plan on visiting this bar (not me), I hope Aggressive Doorman either has a change of character or isn't there all together.

One of the places my husband and I loved visiting but unfortunately tonight the bartender at the basement was so rude I'm afraid I might not go back.
I ordered a drink,gave her my card, she asked if I'd like to keep a tab or close it, I said- please close it. She came back, asked my friend, who also ordered his drink, she asks the same question, he says close it, and she brings him his check and the drink. I tell her that I also had asked to close my tab and she very loudly starts to say - "oh, well, when I ask do you want to keep a tab you nod (makes dramatic nodding gesture- I'm Indian so I'm not sure if that's why she thought it was okay to say that) and by the way, we don't normally do one drink on the card. You have to keep a tab open." I tell her OK, I didn't know. Then she says, "yeah well, you're going to have to come back for your card now because I'm busy."
She did NOT tell me she can't do one drink order on the card, I would have paid cash happily. She didn't have to yell these things at me, and she sure could have closed my tab since she clearly didn't mind doing the same with other customers, including my friend. I'm so sad, because the bartenders upstairs were super nice and welcoming and I have loved coming here in the past for their stand up shows and valued the inclusive feeling.

Union Hall's ambience is LUXURIOUS. Lots of cozy cuddling spots to impress your date!

You don't even have to talk much to your date, because there is LOTS going on here besides eating and drinking.

Need an ice breaker? Jump into bocce ball!

Or see a famous comedian and chat about the performance!

The LIVE COMEDY -- often sold out (buy your tickets in advance) -- is FUN!!

The bar is STELLAR. Miles and Oscar make GREAT martinis with FAT olives :)

Bathroom is European, so do your makeup in advance.

Come to Union Hall to enjoy Italian bowling, books, music, drinks, and comedy.

P.S.
Don't forget your IDs!

While Union Hall's space upstairs is AWESOME with lots of sofas for romantic dates, and the bartenders and drinks ROCK, this is what I DON'T like about Union Hall:

-Union Hall's food menu, which I have been trying since Union Hall first opened, seems to be getting worse. Years ago, at Union Hall, I endured nachos covered in cold Velveeta (processed slimy goo that has an American cheese flavor). Lately, when I go, I struggle finding any healthy vegetarian or fish options. If you want a burger and fries, you should be fine here. Yet, for hungry health nuts, skip this place, unless you seek a healthy martini ;)

-When it comes to live entertainment at Union Hall, you're stuck in a crowded, small basement with a *stage* that's maybe a foot off the ground. Littlefield, which is near by at 635 Sackett Street, has a WAY better performance space, usually charges half as much as Union Hall does, and gets just as much talent.

What I LOVE about Union Hall is:

-The professional, engaging bartenders and bouncers (yes -- the bouncers here are nice).

-The inviting, comfortable sofas and chairs.

-The bocce court, which is always a source of entertainment, whether you are playing or not. However, you might wait forever to actually play bocce yourself.

-The EXCELLENT adult beverages.

-At least 50% of the patrons, who are friendly, on any given night.

-The unisex bathrooms that force you to do hair and make up in a shared, unisex sink room. While this could be a turn off for some, I get a kick out of it, because this bathroom set up is rare for this part of town.

So if you can stand the food menu or aren't hungry, love waiting in line for hours to play bocce, want a decent drink served by experienced bartenders who know what they are doing, want a couch for public date snuggling, enjoy unisex bathrooms, love being surrounded by walls filled with books, and don't mind seeing live performances in a crowded basement with a low ceiling, this might be your ULTIMATE NIGHT LIFE experience!!!

Came here with a friend after hearing it described as "a bar that feels like a library." Yes--I'm in!

There's a lot to say about Union Hall. You walk in, the bar is to your right (it's smaller than you think) and you've got some floor to ceiling book shelves on the left. The shelves are filled with books and are flanked by comfortable seating. It's reminiscent of a social club lounge. Keep walking further and you'll notice a few tables and two huge bocci ball courts/lanes. Bathrooms are downstairs; they're not separated by gender and sport some floor to ceiling doors with the airport like "occupied" latch. Also downstairs is an event space for bands. We didn't get to see it as we went pretty early.

Now you've got the layout of the place. Food. Food was pretty good for bar food. Did I just use the word food three times in two sentences? Did I just use it a fourth? I had a burger and fries. The burger was a little disappointing. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good and for the price, I expected better. The fries were delicious though. I highly recommend the Japanese style spicy mayo for extra yummy'ness.

Can't say the bartenders were really on point here. Maybe it was just early and they were slightly understaffed, but it wasn't especially bad. I will say that the bartender was a little rude to an incoming patron who had a stroller. He told them they didn't allow strollers, but did it in a kind of crappy way. He kept saying "look at the sign," "the sign explains it," "we don't allow strollers." He could have just said the don't allow strollers in the bar, but instead he just kept telling them to look at the sign. That's not a super friendly way to communicate, but it's also not efficient since there's a couple of signs on the door.

Anyway, this is a cool bar to visit and if you're into music, I think it's even better. I'll probably stop in again for a beer if I'm in the area.

One of the bars that makes Brooklyn great. Indoor bocce pits and an Edgar Allen Poe-ish lounge area surrounding a fireplace upstairs and full dance hall downstairs with lots of cool themed events, are its defining features that attract three distinct crowds. But it works so beautifully, and many patrons (myself included) choose to partake in all 3 sections, sometimes in the same night!

$8 for a bud light on a Tuesday 6pm???? Told bartender it says $5 in the menu, which he apologized then as I read the menu a little more I see all beer is $1 off all beer wine and well drinks 4-7 pm. Bud light should of been $4 bucks. Bad day for remembering numbers I guess. I don't know this bar but not off to a good start. Got to watch your money here. Bartender made amends, bought me a beer for honest mistake, alls good cool place, definitely a gay bar, not that is bad just saying overly non deverse

If it wasn't for the rudeness of the bartender I'd give this place 4-5 stars. Arrogant and impatient bartender was one of the worst I've ever seen. If you hate your job so much, why go in every day. He knows I'm patiently waiting for my turn to order and rudely turns to the individual behind me and asks them what they want (individual tells him that I was next). I asked him what a drink includes, he impatiently looks at me as if I'm an idiot and tells me it has some tequila and some juice and then says am I gonna order or not. As I'm placing an order for 6 drinks (same drinks that I asked about) and several appetizers of food, he asks me when the hell am I gonna be done ordering.... Put absolutely zero care into making my drinks which were horrible and we couldn't finish (none of the 6). As important it is to have a nice place with a nice vibe, it's even more important to have people that care about treating your clients with care.

It takes a lot for me to leave a one star review but after having the worst, most negative experience ordering a drink from a bar in New York, possibly in my life, well - you earned it. The bartender exuded so much negative energy from the moment we approached the bar it was nearly tangible. His body language and tone were both aggressive and it made me extremely uncomfortable. If the drinks were good than maybe it would have been mildly forgivable but our drinks were absolutely horrendous.

The vibe in this place is cool but this single interaction with the bartender murdered it. I will never be returning and steering all my friends away from this place at all costs. Get pleasant bartenders, his attitude (Keith is the name on the check) is abhorrent.

Well it saddens me to write this review because I've been coming here well over 8yrs off & on. The mere fact that in this day & age racism still exits is beyond me. I came here during the week after work to get a quick drink & my favorite fries. I sat at the bar as usual & was greeted by a tall heavyset gentlemen who was very nice for what it seemed. I ordered Allagash White & a shot of tequila. Has two rounds of that with fries. Two white gentlemen came in & sat to the left of me and then later on another white male came in & sat to the right of me. I was finishing  up my second round when the bartender offered the gentleman to my right  around on him then he proceeded to offer the single guy to my right a round on him meanwhile I tipped him $10 throughout this disrespect. I would never step foot back into Union Hall after this. Time to move on. FYI...this star is under protest cause it wouldn't let me post my review without rating

Pretty sweet spot might I say. There's even a bocce ball area. I was here for a private video release party downstairs, pretty dope. I was hungry so I ordered the veggie burger and a couple beers. The veggie burger was my top choice since all the yelpers and even the bartender raved about it.

Conclusion? It was beyond delicious. Definitely will stop by in the future on my own now that I know this place exists.
