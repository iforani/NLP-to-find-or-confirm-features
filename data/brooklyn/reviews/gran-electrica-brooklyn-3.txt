Before COVID19: We were in NY visiting the city for the Christmas holiday and staying in Brooklyn one evening.  Gran Electrica was a fun vibe and great place to grab drinks.

Came here during COVID and was seated in the outdoor area. The outdoor seating is gorgeous and very ambient. Wait staff was very attentive and came around frequently to see how we were doing. The cucumber margarita was amazing and super refreshing. My partner and I shared the fish and carnitas tacos and it was TRULY spectacular!! I will be coming here again shortly! Just put an order in for the Churros which look amazing too! Come here!

My lover and I often frequent this establishment after seeing a show at St. Ann's Warehouse. Meaning, we come here when we are in need of intravenous margaritas. That's bc St. Ann's often produces over-hyped trifles directed by the latest Euro-auteur who is basically just recycling some design method that was cool in downtown theater in the 70s. Anyways. We come here and get the margaritas and fish tacos because they are amazing and deep fried in some perfect batter which has some surprising ingredient in it that I can't remember. The margaritas taste non-alcoholic, but trust me. They are. That's because they too have a secret ingredient in them and that secret ingredient is Combier. Bless the gentleman that answered the phone during the pandemic and shared with me the secret to Gran Electrica's margaritas bc they are seriously what has gotten me through the pandemic whilst separated from my best friend, my lover.

I feel like I only go here when I'm in DUMBO because there's nowhere else to go.
Lovely atmosphere but so far the only thing I've had that I like is the queso fundido, which is really good.
Barbacoa tacos weren't very good: they were fatty and I couldn't finish them even though I was super hungry.
Went with a friend around 9pm on a Friday night and we were able to get the last high too table for two.
I've always had a good time here even if the food isn't amazing.

This is a great place for last minute plans because they accept walk-ins! Their chicken tacos were amazing and their salsa and guac is so worth a try! Would definitely go back for the ambience and the food
Ask for their signature cocktails when you're there.

The food and drinks were really good. I had the  carnitas tacos w/ rice and sangria. I particularly loved the backyard area. It was very spacious so nobody was sitting on top of each other. The staff was very nice and wearing masks, which made me feel safe. I would definitely come back here and it's super cute

Probably, the worst tacos I've ever had. I ordered pork tacos and my friend got shrimp or fish tacos, I couldn't tell  We were both trying to figure what was inside.
Pieces of pork were so hard it was almost impossible to chew, and absolutely tasteless. How can one screw tacos so bad?.. they're super easy to make, I cook better ones at home. Guacamole was okay though. Also, I was a bit surprised by the prices. My to-go order came up to $30, plus tip. I had pork tacos and a glass of rosè wine. If tacos were $13, the wine obviously made up for the rest. Rooftop prices for alcohol without the rooftop? No, thank you. I'll pass next time

Gran Electrica reigns supreme as both a dinner or brunch spot in the summer months. I've been here before for dinner and had a great experience, so when friends recommended this spot for brunch on a sunny Sunday, I was in.

Garden seating is where it's at. I had only ever dined there at night but it's equally as beautiful in the day.

The drinks were spot on. I went with the Pepito which was extremely refreshing. My friends tried the Paloma and the Sangria which they raved about as well.

I will say that the portions are pretty small for the price, but the ambiance really makes it worth the splurge.

Gran Electrica is date night ELEVATED.

Do the smart thing and make reservations if possible, or else you will wait about 45 minutes or more for a table in the outdoor dining space. Whether you have a wait or not, just know the outdoor space is entirely worth it. Perfectly lit, vibrant, and fun (with awesome music playing in the background, naturally). It is the perfect little escape from Brooklyn and would make an amazing venue for a private party.

We ordered a few plates to split which was a good choice. Here's what we went with:

The ceviche - orange, avocado, jicama, red onion, cilantro, and pickled jalapeño. The perfect summer dish ($ = MP)

The carnitas tacos (2 per order) - pork, cilantro, and a really good salsa ($11)

The carne tacos (2 per order) - with beef and that dope salsa again ($10)

I will admit that the prices here are a little steep, but keep in mind that you are not only paying for the food, but for the ambiance and experience. Service was really quick and friendly enough. I'd definitely be interested in trying out their brunch too.

This was a disappointing experience. It wasn't awful, but there were some pretty glaring flaws that put a damper on our brunch. Booked a reservation for 8 well in advance for a big group to sit in the fabulous outdoor space in the back. Beautiful ivy on the wall and view of the underside of the Brooklyn Bridge, it had the ambiance check. HOWEVER, we were sat on the far left side of the space near a fence that must have had mountains of trash on the other side due to the amount of flies and occasional gross smells wafting by us during the meal.

As for the food, it was pretty solid but not amazing. Portions varied depending on the dish, but most were good. The quesadilla would be one thing I'd say not get (too small), while the chilaquiles and chorizo would be highlights. HOWEVER, it took over an hour for the food to arrive even though we had the first restoration of the day. They clearly were having kitchen issues because they brought out some free guacamole, which was nice. Still, they even once came and said the food was being plated, which was clearly a lie because it still didnt come for another 30 minutes.

All in all, we had a good time cuz the weather was nice and good company, but I wouldn't bring guests here again after the experience. Writing this out makes my 3 star review feel a little generous to be honest...

This review is specifically for the bar.
After walking the Brooklyn Bridge at night, a friend and I were looking for a little place to sit, have a drink, and maybe munch on something.  We had heard that this place had great churros, and we could get a drink too, so we thought we'd try it.

First of all, the churros were NOT what we expected.  See my picture if you're interested in what we got.  I don't know what we were expecting... but it wasn't this.  They seemed like they had been packaged.

Anyways, the churros aside, the drinks and bartender were great.  We enjoyed just sitting and taking in the atmosphere.  I really did like the decor and our bartender was attentive, but not too attentive.  It didn't seem like this was too touristy. The feel was local, but it could have just been the evening.

I would probably come back, but I wouldn't order the churros.

Came here with a friend to get drinks and catch up. Dumbo has become pretty touristy but this place keeps it cool. When we got there around 5:30 pm it wasn't that busy and we stayed for a looong time. Sitting at the bar, the bartender never rushed us to leave and even as it got really busy they stayed attentive to us. The drinks are also reasonably priced. We ordered all the margaritas, the cucumber (pepino) margarita was my favorite. The grapefruit marg was only a bit spicy, with I nice grapefruit flavor.

We ordered the sangria tostada, I thought it was awful. Not the bartender's fault because they make it in batches before the day. Neither of us liked it and a couple girls next to us also ordered it an complained of the taste. This sangria has a very strong flavor of mezcal (smoky) but with the fruitiness it's just not a great combo. I ended up returning it and getting another margarita.

Sometimes the best places are the one you find at the last minute. This time the choice was mine to make and although I've frequent other spots in the area, I wanted to try something different. As it has done many times before, YELP saved me. Gran Electrica won the day.

Gran Electrica seems to be quite popular and so I would highly recommend that you make a reservation. It's a small place but absolutely charming. This night I was dining with a friend and so I guess reserving a table was easy. Although they have seating on the inside, we opted to eat out on their patio. I'm glad we did. It doesn't have much of view but the ambiance it provides is cute.

The staff was excellent. I didn't catch the brothers name that served us but he was definitely on point and our tip reflected that. As for the food, I wish they would add another taco. Most places give you at least three. The two fish tacos were superb but two left us wanting more. The salsa and guacamole and margaritas were equally delish. So, if your in the area, make a reservation and enjoy.

I came here with some work friends and had a great time. Great ambience. Good drinks. Food was decent. We got the Carnitas taco and short rib taco. I felt like the portion was small for the price. The carnitas was two tacos, each about the size of my palm. The short rib was just 1 piece. They both tasted amazing just wish there was more. We got churros for dessert, that was the best pick. Service was great.

Came at a friend's recommendation but I was pretty disappointed. The ambiance is great with the Mexicana decor. But the food and drinks were a-ok at best and priced high. Do it for the chic but not for the taste.

We ordered:
- 1/2 carafe Sangria $23
- Margarita Electrica $14
- Yucca Frita $8

So I was super excited for this meal, and I felt like a boss just walking in with my reservation (glad I made one, it was packed). The outdoor seating area is gorgeous and I recommend going at night when all the string lights are on.

I had the sangria, which was not what I was expecting. The waitstaff said it would be smokier than I was used to, and I guess it was, but it didn't come with any fruit or really taste like sangria. It was strong though, so ultimately it did the job.

We ordered the yucca frita, which I'm pretty sure was undercooked because it was still kind of starchy, but the ceviche was super smooth and quite delicious. Noah got the Chili Relleno, which he admitted was good, but nothing special.

All in all I'm glad we tried Gran Electrica, but based on the hip website, the need for a reservation and the price point, I was expecting it to be much better than it was.

The vibe is out of the worldly. I recommend you sit in the back open area. The lighting, the dj, the drinks made for such a nice dinner.

P.S. everyone try their michaladas.

New York. Tacos? Brooklyn. Tequila? Dumbo. Mescal? I'm in love with Brooklyn already. Forget the City. Well, you don't have to because cross the bridge and you are in the heart of it anyway.

All I know is that this night was about meeting one of my besties from DC who resides in the area now and we were staying within walking distance of Mexican food. Our hotel recommended Gran Electrica. It's small, intimate and has a fun decor. Similar to our ethnic haunts of restaurants and bars in the District and Virginia (where we spent time during our 20's and 30's). We had electric soul then and we have no reason to give it up now!

Both of us married and husbands in tow, tonight was about great company and good food. The word Gran fits more with our age now, but thank goodness you can sit in a room and have a conversation at an appropriate noise level. My meal consisted of a Agave cocktail (wait for the punch line) with a sugar rim that was superb. Of, course I got the tacos and a side of rice. Forget the signs outside (on this night, although they will make you laugh), the tacos won and no need for tequila as the only people we were texting this night were in our own group.

My friend and I have dined at George Bush's (senior) favorite restaurant in Falls Church, VA, so intrigued our friends purchased us ALL the Bok Choy plants in the restaurant to decorate my new place at the time (and struggled to get them home safely), we attended Shaquille O'Neill 21'st birthday party at Lulu's in DC (before anyone really knew who he was) and these are the tame experiences of our existence. We had MANY coincidences, more than any two people probably could have, which no longer make things a coincidence. Perhaps, it was just meant to be. I love my homegirl and Brooklyn. Our husbands area pretty amazing too.

Another reason to eat at Gran Electric. Napa! We will have to visit the NorCal location on our tour of Jam Cellars and BottleRock.
Gran Eléctrica create cocktails that give back to charities, such as Black Lives Matter, Red Nose Day, The UN Refugee Agency, etc.
Prior to our trip, the son and daughter in-law recently discovered a bat in their home in New England and had to bring in an exterminator.
Gran Eléctrica has a line of "bat friendly" agave spirits (I sure hope that's the one I tried). Apparently, there would be no agave without bats. So the punch line is...when life gives you bats, it's time to make agave! Cheers to the perfect Halloween to be treat!

It was a rainy Sunday, my plans were stymied, so I knew only tacos could save the day. Gran Electrica not only provided delicious food but great music.

It's dimly lit, so this place makes a great date night spot. I really like the design of the restaurant; it's intimate, romantic, and carefully curated. I came with 2 other friends, and we were seated rather quickly. I ordered the fish and pork tacos, the plantains, and the churros.

The fish tacos were my favorite thing, I had to order another one! It was perfectly fried, and the flavors surrounding it were perfect. I enjoyed the pork tacos, but they didn't give me as much joy as the fish ones. I loved that the plantains were covered in cheese, and they were perfectly ripe. I loved the churros; they gave chocolate and caramel sauce, and the caramel sauce was my favorite. I will definitely be back again to try the guacamole and the short rib entree.

I walked in with a friend and asked the hostess if they had happy hour, she said yes then proceeded to seat us at a table, then our server came and told us happy hour was only at the bar, so we had to sit by the door because the bar was full.

Once we finally got the bartenders attention the margarita electrica was very nice, and we ordered chips and salsa. Chips are cold but salsa was spicy and great.

Super cool tequila bar in DUMBO which we enjoyed thoroughly! Great put very petite guacamole and salsa for $16 which is pretty steep considering how tiny the portions were but totally cool place! I would definitely come back here for happy hour and more cocktails and ceviche next time.

The portions are absurdly small.

$16 for the Quesadilla entree (literally just one tortilla folded in half, cut into 2 pieces).

$15 for Queso Fundido app (came with maybe 10 tortilla chips)

You would think this was a tapas place...

It was good food, but I needed maybe 3x more food to consider it a meal.

Food was great. We went inside quite late like almost 10pm for dinner but itwas really busy which we thought it must be good. However the service was extremely TERRIBLE. We were not be served anything at all. We need to call staff on our own for just a still water for the table (staffs here are also really difficult to get their attentions, everyone of them were walking by pretending that they were so rush doing their own tasks). Finally we caught a guy to take our order and that was when he gave us water. Then after that no one else really gave us attention that water was out, dishes were finished and table need to be cleared, dessert menu needs to be presented, and drinks were done, should have offered more..... nothing like that here.

Eventually we got attention by a bar staff and we complained how terrible the service here, hence we won't give any tips then she went to call the manager for us to speak to. Extremely appreciated for manager who received our complaint nicely, professionally and offered us free drinks. Somehow, the feeling of nice food, great ambience, lovely deco were all gone by the toxic service team here. Definitely didn't give them good tips.

If you're in the area & looking for your Mexican food cravings to be satisfied, this is the spot. The location isn't too bad either, located in Brooklyn but closer to the bridges so you're really just a hop on a subway or walk across the bridge from the beautiful city of Manhattan.
This spot is the perfect cross between the cultures in the city of Brooklyn. The flavors will give you a feeling you've never experienced before. Savor the lengua tacos & enjoy the delicacy of the beautiful surroundings.
The venue is really nice. The wallpaper screams art literally. You're surrounded by a wallpaper design of sugar skulls in different settings.
Plus, the servers always make sure that your cup is full.

Loved their margaritas and their tacos were delicious if not pricey

They are strict about waiting for the full party to be there in order for you to be seated, but they gave us free delicious appetizers while we waited at the bar for the rest of our party

This is a small plate place and I don't know why that isn't advertised. We came here for a friend's birthday dinner. The hostess was great, the table we had was in their back room with a crying child and she said they could set up another table in 15min if we were willing to wait at the bar which we were. We ordered their two quesadillas to start (we were a group of 6). The quesadillas were TINY, it looked like someone cut a quesadilla into 8 and gave us two pieces. They were tasty though. We ordered guacamole which came out in a minuscule cup, about the size of coleslaw that comes with your sandwich at a diner. So we ordered a second. Again it was good, but far too small a portion. Then we got entrees which were the size of appetizers. The al pastor was a small cup of rice with some pork along the side of the plate with two leeks. The tacos are really small (about 4 inch tortillas) and the chile relleno was filled with only cheese so it was akin to eating a bowl of melted cheese. The chile was inedible and came drowned in a mole sauce. Definitely would not order that again.
The prices are quite expensive given the portion sizes and we were barely satiated after the meal. I would not go back and they should make it known that they are a small plates restaurant.

Had to downgrade to 1 star due to the hostess and her attitude or personal problem.

We came here on a Thursday night around 6pm, bar area was packed and we put our names down for a table. There were two hosts there, the male host welcomes us with a big smile, while the female hostess just stared blankly at me without making any facial expression. OK you hate your job, not my problem.

Anyways, it's over 95 degrees out there, and near the door where we were waiting the AC really wasn't working. I felt a lot warmer than normal due to pregnancy so I started using their menu as fan to cool myself down. To be fair, it's not the best use of their bar menu, but it's clipped on a hardboard so I was really using the hardboard to provide a little breeze without really touching the menu. Then for 1 min I put down the menu to check my phone, the poker-faced hostess made a point to walk over and put up the menu against the wall. Is she trying to tell me not to use that as a fan? Unfortunately that's my only resort and I ain't gonna give it up. Look around, do you not see people are sweating? If you want people not to use menu as fan, maybe turn up the damn AC??

We were seated promptly after all parties arrived. Their dining room felt a lot cooler, and our waitress was amazing. We got the usual, chips and salsa and guacamole, fish tacos, lamb barbacoa. We were just starting to enjoy ourselves, the hostess, who came into the dining room to seat some other guests, tapped on my shoulder and asked me to move in my chair so people can walk. I looked around, everyone else's chair was as far out as mine, and none of the waiters/waitresses have bumped into my chair since we sat down. I told her there's nowhere to move and showed my preggo belly. She rolled her eyes, and walked away. Maybe she still couldn't get over me using bar menu as fan, but sorry lady, do not ever ask a pregnant woman to do things that are unreasonable, it would never work!

Apologies for the long description, back to food. I only get fish tacos here because some other dishes I've tried before weren't as great. The lamb barbacoa was a bit on the dry side, but flavor was good. I was pretty satisfied. To the restaurant: (1) train the hostess better, or replace her. Clearly she doesn't like her job and holds grudges against whatever that doesn't even make sense. (2) TURN UP the AC by the door on a hot day.

This place is more popular than I thought! We came here on a Tuesday night around 7:30pm without a reservation, and the wait was about 30min. Luckily the bar was wide open so we sat down. The interior is dark with a feel of wood and metal (say industrial chic?) Supposedly they have a courtyard so I will have to try next time.

We got some cocktails, ceviche, fish taco, and beef brisket taco.  I'm not a big margarita fan, which seems to be the one drink everyone else was getting. My sangria was decent, and my husband's drink was good too. Ceviche was pretty amazing, fish and shrimp were fresh, tastes were perfectly balanced by acidity from lime, creaminess of avocado and bitterness of radish. LOVE LOVE.  Fish in taco was perfectly fried - batter was not too thick and fish inside was tender and moist. Beef taco was a little inconsistent - some chunks of meat were more chewy than the others, but the flavors were pretty good.

I will need to make reservation to come back soon so I can try other things!

Nice atmosphere but average food. Food is a bit on the pricier side and the restaurant does not offer complimentary chips and salsa. I ordered the Carnitas tacos ($12 for 2). The taco was good but on the dry side and did not come with any sides. The restaurant was very lively on a Thursday night- a great atmosphere to socialize with friends.

I love this restaurant: the ambiance, the people, the food and the drinks. Textures and flavors are above and beyond. I recommend this restaurant to anyone who appreciates innovation and creativity in cuisine, but craves comfort and familiarity. Gran Electrica is both.

I come here every time I'm in New York, and the experience is always amazing. Located right in Dumbo, it's a really great location. Good vibes throughout the entire restaurant, and has a nice aesthetic. I love the candles and the lighting, the bar set up is also super cute.

I usually order the fish tacos, and they're always delicious and fresh. They're very filling and a great value for what you pay. Also, their guacamole is so delicious. A good selection of drinks, and the servers are always great for providing recommendations.

Good place to go to after viewing the sightseeing, a bit pricey but worth it, yuca Frita is a must try, the pickled  onionS and the green salsa were good. Would've loved the tortillas to be handmade for the price. Overall pleasant experience

Went to Gran Eléctrica last night and it was great.  Food, drinks, service all lovely.  We ordered the yucca fries, chorizo queso fundido and carnitas tacos (ok so I wasn't vegetarian for the evening.). But the main thing was...  I was there w a potential suitor and the waiter let us stay for hours.  It wasn't super packed but he didn't rush us to leave and it was very kind of the mgmt to do this.  I would definitely go back (suitor or not!) bc it was such a pleasant experience.  Also the table next to us was having a wedding party and the couple and their friends were adorable. :)

What a gem! We would have never found this place it, if it wasn't recommended by the staff at Grimaldi's. The margaritas are truly creative and taste just as delicious as they are designed. We loved the vibe and had a great time hanging out at the bar relaxing. The bartender took excellent care of us and made us feel welcomed from the moment we walked in. We will definitely try to return on a trip back to New York.

Some quality modernized Latin food right here. The vibe the place had was quite unique with the DJ, funky wallpaper, and stringed lights. Though earning outside on the patio is a MUST. The margs frickin slapped! The food itself was moderately priced but also small portion sizes. I recommend getting a side with your meal (the refried beans were quality).

My friends and I were walking around Dumbo on a Friday night, and saw this place under the Brooklyn Bridge. We went in, and we're so glad we did! This is one of the coolest bars I've ever seen! They take great pride in crafting their cocktails, and making sure your drink is exactly how you thought it would be. This isn't your typical bar, every cocktail is handcrafted by organic Mexican spirits.
The bathrooms are very clean, and very big. I didn't order here, just had a couple drinks with my friends. The bar area is amazing, and we were treated very well by Everyone we came in contact with! I would definitely Come back to this place in the future!

One of my favorite spots EVERRRR!!!! Third time here. This time came to meet with an ex who wanted to get together *insert eye roll emoji here* Cozy. Intimate. candle lit. The ceviche is to die for. Their margarita electrica is superb. Late spring/Summer months the back patio is open so you'll definitely enjoy that. Treat ya self
