Pandemic review! They have backyard and outdoor seating in the front. Two tables out front, but not sure what is in the back. They have either on tap brews or they have a beer shoppe that you can buy a set of beers or ciders as well. We did some beers on tap - they had other half, grimm etc so good variety and quality too. The bartender was awesome. Place was queen + bathroom. Open until 9 pm right now. Never knew this place existed until a friend told me about it!

A few colleagues and I came here on a Friday evening. I am not a beer drinker but I will say if I were this would be a nice hole in the wall spot. They have a great selection of beers (both tap and bottled). According to the regular in the group, they switch up the menu every so often. I can't remember the name of the tap beer I got but I do remember it was the number 5 as of (10/18/19). Shoutout to the bartender for pointing me in this direction after I explained to him I am not a beer drinker but did like IPAs. I enjoyed my glass and went for another.

The crowd wasn't too bad when we arrived around 6pm, it did begin to pick up around 8pm. They have a back patio (not sure if it is open year round). The only downside to my experience was that bartender was the only person catering to the entire bar. Also they claim to have a wine selection but it is very limited. Other than that no complaints!

Random Side note: The restroom was also sparkling clean... I mean  extremely clean lol.

Oh the bar seats are open and there are 5 available for a part of 2. We picked the best seats with the view of their 42inch? Tv.

The menu is filled with craft beer from mostly NY and some Maine brews. Ranging from light to dark beer, our bartender is very glad to let us try couple. I forgot what they were except #5 and #16 are our choices. For $8 you can get a 16oz last around 1 hours if you nurture it. Behind the bar, there is a stack and racks of can beer. You can buy them to go. I know there's a backyard which is decent sized probably seats 20 people.

Food wise. I saw some chip behind the counter and a lot of plate. We didn't order any food but maybe next time.

The service is expected of a bar. Ask for a drink, you get a drink. Ask anytime else, you can get a "I don't know" or "why you ask me" look. Avoid asking stupid question.

It's good to drink in Brooklyn. Ya know, just in case the brewery you wanted to visit was closed due to a wedding (note: have wedding at brewery). Instead you can always find a place not too far off like St. Gambrinus Beer Shoppe.

This was back in those carefree summer days when I ventured to Gowanus with a couple o' chums and had to alter plans for our third beer stop due to said private libation celebration. It's cool though because I wouldn't have found SGBS. Now? I know an awesome place to flight it up and buy some brews (for later).

Ya see, this place is like a specialty shop (or shoppe?) that is devoted to the enjoyment of beer. Walk in and you can hang at the bar area and grab a flight of varying Burrough brewed beer or perhaps you want to peruse the wall of cans and bottles available for purchase on the go. We did a little of both.

Truth be told, the brews I tried were somewhat forgettable (or at least forgettable enough that I can't remember them as I type this). But hey, that's  not really what's important. It's about the chill, laid back vibe of the place. It's about Brooklyn roots it seems to grow (figuratively, though the courtyard area is a nice touch). And it's about beer and just being in a place that shares the same level of love you probably (hopefully) have.

Overall, St. Gambrinus Beer Shoppe is a stop worthy of taking any time you find yourself in Brooklyn. No reason is needed. Just go, try a few brews, maybe buy some cans, and know that a place like this exists (especially for those days when a brewery just doesn't cut it).

Great place to sit with a beer.  Ambiance is chill, so it's a great place to meet up with friends and chat.  They have an awesome selection both on tap and otherwise and their snacks are tasty, although I wish they offered something a little more in that department.  (Girls gonna have a beer or two or three? Girls gonna need a snack.)
Would definitely check it out if you're a beer fan.

Great beer/cider selection to stay or to takeaway. They sell a good amount of drafts and have a nice mix of ips, sours, ales, and stouts. I'm a cider drinker and I love that they always have a nice little selection to choose from in the to-go area.

The atmosphere is lovely, it's a cozy spot with lots of little tables and boardgames to share. The bartenders are always friendly and they have small bites to order if you're hungry. It's never too loud and there's usually a place to sit and try something new.

I'm really looking forward to checking out their patio when the weather is nice.

Cool Concept

A great place to go for a beer - they usually have at least 16 different beers on tap. And they'll give you a free taste in case you're not sure you'll like the beer. If you want something other than a beer, there's wine, cider and soft drinks. Oh, and they have charcuterie, cheese and pita chips and Middle Eastern dips as well. The place has a nice, relaxed vibe.

The place always has some great tunes playing.  A very chilled crowd looking to sip on a couple of craft beers.

Thanks

If you're wondering whether or not this place is the place to go in a sea of bars, then yes, this is the place. I'll make up your mind for you. You're welcome.

We wandered around the neighborhood on a lazy Sunday afternoon with the intention of eating brunch. Of course, the first order of business was to Yelp for somewhere respectable, but the results showed that to be too far of a walk. So this place pops up on what I call the "yum radar" with lots of stars. We decided, what the heck, let's get our drink on first and then worry about food. Done. Maybe they'll have some pub food too.

After making ourselves comfortable, the second order of business was to search online what the significance of St. Gambrinus is. I didn't know this, but it's named after the patron saint of beer, the king of beer, the big kahuna, you get my drift.. So that means that this place is pretty great. Yes indeedy!

We bought a flight of beers to see what IPA variety they offered, and lo and behold I didn't know any of the names or breweries. It shows you what kind of beer connoisseur I am! Obviously the bartender is the expert and she suggested the flight that we enjoyed. I do, however, know the warm and tingly sensations beer can make, so hello old friend. As we made our way across the the numbered beer map, not unlike Nicolas Cage in National Treasure, it became obvious that I cared more about food at a certain point, and ditched this number to name game.

When it came to ordering food, it was more of the opposite experience to what I expected. I ordered what I thought would be bar food, but instantly regretted it when the bartender told me to come back in 5 minutes. Ok, so the bartender makes my food. Fair enough. Faster forward to 5 minutes and I'm not impressed. We finish our panini slabs and I'm still hungry.

I think it's unfair to give this place a bad rap based on the lack of great food, but it makes up with the vast selection of beer and open space. However, I will still deduct one star since I was still hungry.

Fantastic beer list and really awesome bartenders. They offer a flight option where the price slightly decreases depending on what you order. I was annoyed last time because there was a $1/flight markup on almost ALL of the beers on tap.

Basically, 7 4oz pours is $14. But, because everything was marked up because of rarity (presumably), that would go up to $21 for 7...which is nuts.

Regardless, the taps are excellent and so is the can selection. They have a very small selection of beer you can buy to take home, but it's expertly curated and there's great stuff available. One of the few places you'll find Interboro, KCBC, etc. available in cans outside of the brewery.

I'll definitely be back...let's just hope they get those markups on taps under control!

I remember being here a really really long time ago in the winter or fall when I was claiming a beer book coupon years ago. I really enjoyed the space and didn't have much reason for coming back other than it just escaping my mind and not being in the immediate area. I was early for a Yelp Event next door at their virtual reality place and remembered this and stepped in for a drink. Still really cool place and they have an outdoor garden area in the back I wasn't aware of before. Didn't check out their cans in the small fridge in the back but they have so much on tap of unique beers. I tried a coconut salty gose and a sour cider that tasted apparently like mezcal. Happy hour is a dollar off drafts and you can also get a smaller glass if you don't want to commit to spending money on a full 16 oz pour. Felt like prices might be a dollar or two higher than other beer shoppes in Brooklyn. They do have some small bites on their menu like chips, pimento cheese, paninis, etc. but I was good and didn't order anything. I am curious though about what's up with the harry potter looking witch hat situated at the bar.

Pros: good selection, friendly bartenders, fun hangout spot
Cons: none

When im in Brooklyn I always make it a point to stop in here.  They have a great location in close proximity to the barclay subway stop.  The selection here is really quite good.  There are times when I dont really find anything to get too excited over and then others when youll find head scratching gems! You can drink on premisis for a corkage fee, but they have a taplist that seems to always have some local beers that youll be more than happy to grab a pour of.

The real draw for here is the friendliness and passion of the staff.  You can tell they work here because they love craft beer.  Ive had many good times chatting with the friendly patroms and staff.  I look forward to stopping in on my next NY trip.

Admittedly, I've known about St. Gambrinus for a few years (since it opened) and never stopped by despite living 5 minutes away. But we finally stopped in, and it was a fun experience.

Bartender (owner maybe?) was a super cool guy. Loved his beer, but wasn't a snob. Speaking of beer, their selection is top notch, both in bottles and on draft. And yes, they also do growlers!

They have a cozy backyard. They also have food, but we didn't order any.

Will definitely be returning! Might just have to join their beer club...

My usual go to for anything happening at Barclays

The staff are always friendly, the beers always flowing and the ambience always inviting. What more do you need from a beer shop?? Ah yes, the patron saint of beer!

That said, the outside patio is a nice touch on a perfect spring or fall day. The selection is top notch, both bottle and draught! They do a nice job rotating local and out of state beers. The pricing is respectable considering the quality being offered.

Check this place out when you have time so you can take advantage of their superb beer selection! Make it a point to stop in before a game!

I have a new favorite hangout spot near the Atlantic Center. AND NO, It's not Buffalo Wild Wings. A plague on that place! Besides it would be super weird for a review of that to be in here.

I don't know who Saint Gambrinus is. I'm sure I could google it and find out. I'd rather not though. I'd like to imagine he's the angel of beer and happiness, because that's what this place is to me. Beer and happiness. So don't ruin it by telling me. Oh wait, it's on their menu. Dammit.

The beer selection, value and servings here are fantastic. You can get different sized pours, mix up what you want, and do what you want, all at a low low price!

They have lot of limited edition beers here as well. And while I've only been here to consume drinks while I was here, they have an extensive selection of beer for people looking to buy on the go. Even for you growler heads.

It's great for going to before the Barclays. And if you bought/intend to buy tickets from stubhub, guess who is next door? Score!

When it's nice out, they got a little backyard area. If you want to switch it up, they have some nice wines. And if you're feeling hungry, they got some snacks. This place is a gem!

Make sure you come by and check it out.

Good beer.  Monday's are best.  The rest of the week is sad.  The beer is good.  I'll be back on a Monday cuz the service makes me glad.  The crowd is ok.  Typical for the area.  However, there were other times when I didn't feel 100 percent welcome.   I'll be back for the beer and cross my fingers when I bring my pals there on any day other than a Monday.  Go Monday!!!!

Always a great experience. My wife is a picky beer drinker but we always manage to find a sour or ipa that works for her. The outside space is nice as well.

Plus you can buy beers to take home. Been here many times and even suggested by my wife we stop by.

Art recommended this place so I swung on by. Wow, Atlantic Av has really changed a lot since I was last here years ago. I honestly didn't recognize it.

Bar is really close to subway and it's cozy. When I first sat down, I don't think the bartender liked me too much for some strange reason but then quickly warmed up. Came in the middle of the day and there were about 4-6 other customers there. Drank some solid beers and left. Nothing too interesting other than this.

This place is awesome. Nice staff, fantastic selection of beer both on draft and to go, and an all around good atmosphere. There's an indoor drinking area as well as an outdoor garden to enjoy the multitude of beer options. Not to mention there are food and snacks if you're hungry. I spent a good three hours here just drinking and hanging out. A great spot in Brooklyn, I highly recommend it to anyone in the area looking for a good selection of beer and a solid way to start out the evening.

We went earlier today, grabbed a beer each. Delicious. I had the LIC visceral emotion. My husband had the other half mosaic + motueka.

Great beer selection. Ample seating. Chill vibe. Nice place to pop in on a cold Saturday afternoon, after a cycling class at IMAXShift. My husband bought a bunch of cans and bottles as a gift for his dad. We would def come back.

After walking around to find a quick drink while I waited for a friend, I stopped in here to pass the time. Definitely worth the stop. I started out having the 4 for $10 flight. The flight specials are:
4 for $10
5 for $12
6 for $14
Nothing like a nice selection to keep you going. Bartender was nice, the owner (I think it was the owner) was very polite and greeted whomever he came into contact with (not typically the case at other places).
So for a nice drink and a calming atmosphere, stop in and enjoy. But but but wait...there's more!!

They have a wall of beer! The wall-o-beer has a large variety of domestic and imports for you to purchase on your way out. I guess that's it...nope!
There's an outside seating area in the back. Sip your beer in comfort and relative peace in the back seating area.
I will visit his place again...so many beers, so little time.

While I have been to this craft beer spot many times and have always enjoyed the bartenders and wide selection of craft beers. Upon a recent visit I believe the male bartender (owner) was unpleasant to deal with. It left us wanting to leave as soon as possible. While I'm sure we will return as it is the only craft beer takeaway in the area, I will be sure avoid going in if he is around. Such as shame it's always been a great experience with other staff members.

This place is literally a block away from the Barclays Center and a great place to grab a drink or light fare  before your event.

The draft list is much more reasonably priced at St. Gambrinus and the selection is leaps and bounds better here than what you can find inside Barclays. For example I had a Grimm Apricot Rubus here for $7 while Barclays charged me $12 for an Ommegang nirvana IPA.

There is also food here and we're looking at $6 for a bratwurst which takes ~8 minutes to prepare so order it first if you plan to eat before the game. Prices inside Barclays runs you like $14 for a simple taco bowl.

The beertender also doubles as your chef and was super friendly. There are tables along the front and the back including seating in the backyard or right at the bar. When I walked in at 7pm on a Friday night before a Nets game I thought it was packed since everyone congregated near the front but the back tables were still empty. The beer selection to go is also priced competitively for a smaller store in NYC and the selection is definitely very diverse. They even had a beer I've been searching for just sitting on the shelves: The Mikkeler Beer Geek Brunch

Love this place. My boyfriend and I make weekly trips here to pick up beers, and sometimes we'll stay in the store or in the garden out back. They have a wide selection of more obscure/hard-to-find bottled beers and roughly 13 drafts on tap, including lots and lots of IPAs to choose from (even though I personally don't love IPAs). I discovered my new favorite beer, Sophie, here. They also do flights and snacks, but I haven't tried any yet.

Big plus: the bartenders are always very friendly!

This place may be in the Bermuda Triangle based on the fact that after spending three hours there, my Yelp app still said it couldn't locate me (although my Google maps app knew right where I was).   So I was not ever able to "check in" on Yelp but I do recommend that you "check out" this place!

Came here with beer club and we really had a nice time.  The owners are super nice and know a lot about beer.  They had a great variety on tap (16 different types) and i found a lot of unique stuff that I hadn't had before, plus a few old favorites...like Mad Elf, my favorite holiday beer!

The bites they have to eat were tasty (my group ate a lot of the grilled cheese) and service was excellent throughout the evening.

This place is ridiculously easy to get to from anywhere since it's a block from the Atlantic Ave/Barclays Center subway stop.

If you live anywhere in NYC, you should get here and if you live in Brooklyn, you have no excuse not to be here at least once a week.

Hop on down to Atlantic Avenue and check out this gem.

Beer Stop 123
-----

I came to St Grambrinus during a long layover at JFK. I honestly wish the layover was longer! This place was awesome - it kind of has a wine bar feel to it, with a super awesome back patio area.

First thing, the service was awesome. I had a small suitcase with me and the bartender immediately asked where I'm from, what kind of beer I like, etc. She provided several recommendations (both on draft and in bottle) for stuff I can't find in San Diego. She really knew her stuff and the recommendations she provided were awesome.

St Gambrinus only has 16 beers on tap, but the tap list is well thought out. They have some weird, obscure stuff on that you can't find anywhere else.

Can't wait to come back.

Great neighborhood spot to grab a beer. Super comfortable inside and always inviting.

If you enjoy tasting different types of beer, this is a good place to go. They also have food -- grilled cheese sandwiches and a few other snacks. Recommended is you are in the area.

Nice beer shop/bar on Atlantic right down the street from Barclays Center.  If you are searching for a quality beer before a game or concert this is a great stop.  Selection was pretty expansive with several local/NY brews and some quality national micro brews on draft.  Food menu is small but the brat I had was excellent.  Barkeep worked a wonder with the small "kitchen" behind the bar :)

Keep the good beer movement going and keep up the strong work!

"Drinking beer with a saint is so heavenly"

This shoppe/bar is a wonderful spot to grab a beer to stay or to take home. They have an amazing selection of different types of beer. I have not found an IPA that I did not like at this spot. I only have had positive experiences drinking here; mainly because the staff is so helpful and knowledgeable about their products.

Oh, the shoppe has a nice patio in the back that is perfect during the nicer months.

I can't rightfully say I'm a big fan of beer. Most small-batch craft stuff tastes like an overpowering mess to me, which is one reason why flights are nice. I appreciate that this place does that for us, the thirsty public. Incredibly, I went the next day to this place in Pennsylvania with something like 120 beers on tap, and they did not do flights. Anyway, yes, even I can find something here that doesn't taste like a ghost died in it.

My only complaint is regarding the loose cans for sale in the back. Many of them, I'm sure, are rare breeds of secret beer and are worth $3-4 each. However, I spotted at least one the shelf that I'd seen elsewhere for $1-2. I suppose you don't come to a shop with "e" at the end to save money, but then again I personally am so cheap that I once slept in a storage unit for a summer.

What a gem of a find. Near Barclays Center and a block from the subway. Quaint and inviting on the inside too. The owner (and customers) were friendly and helpful. Knowledgeable of beer and what's popular nationwide. I was impressed and brought many beers back to NC! They even had cider for those that are gluten free. I'll stop by next time I'm in town (and bring you a sour from Wicked Weed). Thank you!

Would like to give the selection here 3.5 stars.  No real complaints.  Nothing groundbreaking, but a solid spread, standard craft beer bottle shop.

That said, the cruddy rating is based on 2 major things:

First: On 20+ trips to this store I have only once encountered an employee who actually knows anything about beer.  Whether it's a bartender who tries to tell me that "Hop Showers" isn't an IPA and it isn't hoppy ("I hate IPAs, that one's not for me" "Don't worry, its just a pale ale, not too hoppy, you'll like it, I promise!") or someone who when asked the difference between two large format imperial stouts responds "well, they're both ummm.... {reads the bottle} stouts, so they're pretty similar... I don't know what to tell you."  This lack of knowledge combined with the attitude you get if you ask to sample anything on tap??  Not a pleasant experience

Second: The prices are HIGHWAY ROBBERY.  I drink plenty of craft beer, and plenty of expensive, rare craft beer.  I'm more than happy to pay the going rate for a good beer, but their prices for more "specialty beers" are 2-3x more than any other bottle shop in NYC.

It literally PAINS me that this is the only bottle shop in my neighborhood.

Great little shop with an impressive beer selection.

Friendly folks, fair prices, and in general a really great place for craft beer lovers to go.

If you're in the area it's definitely worth stopping by. No complaints, thus the short review.

This place is a neighborhood staple that I just can't get enough of. The atmosphere is so relaxing and cozy, and I always feel a little adventurous trying out new beers. We joined as members this year and get special discounts and emails on the new beers coming in.  And love that you can pick up a six pack to take home too. We love you St. Gambrinus!

The owners of this place are so nice, enthusiastic and happy to share their knowledge of craft beers you'll need to have more than just one. Great space, lighting, and music that doesn't block a great conversation. 1 block from Atlantic terminal and a great neighborhood.

Awesome plus- they sell beer toooooi!!

Good selection of local craft beers on tap, with a few regional domestic crafts mixed in. One thing they don't have a lot of on tap is good foreign beers. There are a lot of wheat beers typically as well, which I wish they didn't do as much of. In fact, when I was in one chilly night about two weeks ago they didn't even have anything hearty up yet, like a porter, stout, or any strong ales.
The backyard space with the cherry blossoms is sweet when the weather is nice. The interior still has that new bar feel, where the decor and furniture hasn't really established itself in the surrounding yet.
I typically avoid buying bottles to go here as they're quite pricy.
As another Yelper mentioned, some of the bartenders aren't very knowledgable, nor particularly friendly or sociable. There seems to be a high-ish turnover.

Great location within a short crawl from Atlantic Ave station and Barclays Center for prefunking before Nets games. Beer geeks and novices alike are welcome here in a casual but modern and laid back environment. Nice big windows on Atlantic Ave with lots of sunlight make me feel better about drinking at 2PM.

Tap list is nicely curated with a good variety of beers and brewers. Tap list includes more esoteric breweries and brews than most other supposed beer places but you can still get a ipa or pilsner or other standard style brew.

Bottle and can selection include variety a from gluten free to international to local selections. Plus the prices are reasonable.

For non-beer drinkers, you can get one of several varietals of less accessible (and delicious) Portuguese wine.

Patio looks promising for future beverage enjoyment.
