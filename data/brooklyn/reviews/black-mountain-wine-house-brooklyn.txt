This place is super cute, even with only outdoor seating. Pet friendly, great prices and good food. Can't go wrong!

Me and my closest friend have been craving wine for the longest, and what's the best thing to do after a long work week? is to find a new adventure. I took it upon myself to surfer the amazing world of Yelp and I stumbled upon this place. It's a vintage looking establishment, that provides a cozy feeling. The staff is very welcoming and answer your every question, I must say they have a good selection of wine. We had the Sauvignon Blanc, which satisfied my taste buds from beginning to the end. I'll be coming back.

Gowanus is probably my favorite section of Brooklyn for fabulous food. Black mountain wine house has a great neighborhood feel, you like you're in someones home. It doesn't feel stuffy, or pretentious. It's an extremely warm and welcoming resturant.

I started with the petite sirah for wine, and I wish I had stayed with that the whole night. It was smooth, bold, not too dry with good spice notes at the end.

The cured meat was probably my favorite small bite. Don't sleep on the housemade wholegrain mustard.  Everything was very well executed and had a great balance of flavors. I can't wait to come back and try more wine.

Overall: Would definitely come back to try more food. It's so home-y!

Ambiance: Cozy with a real fireplace and casual outdoor front area (enclosed). Feels very much like a lodge. Loved the random books inside. Limited seating though.

Service: Attentive without being bothersome. Staff seemed chill.

Food: Cheese was good, especially the tÃªte de moine swiss. Charcuterie was average - nothing unique.

Drinks: Lots of solid wine options. Enjoyed the Cannonau red wine.

This is such an ideal date spot. Or in my case, it's such an ideal third-wheel spot. I've passed this place numerous times walking over from Gowanus to Park Slope. Its eye grabbing. Its a little log cabin house that looks like it belongs in the mountains or an abandoned forest and has been converted into a wine and cheese night cafe. They even have a cute porch with chairs out front. Wine was pretty affordable. For not being happy hour I could still get an over flowing chalice of Tempranillo for $8. Interesting food menu of cheese and charcuterie platters, mac and cheese with truffle oil, paninis, meatballs, crostini, and tarts. What you would expect at a wine bar. But the ambiance is really nice. I imagine this is great in the winter time and I think they even roar up a fireplace then.

Oh, they surprisingly also have a decent bottled beer menu. Any place that sells Samuel Smith oatmeal is doing something pretty right. I also played that game while I was half listening to my couple friends called 'How many of these people are on blind dates and how many of these people are in actual relationships' game. It's a good one. I'm pretty sure the table next to us with the two kids downing red wine, staring awkwardly at their menus and avoiding eye contact, separated as far apart as possible were blind date.

Rainy days in January and February were made for Black Mountain Wine House.

As the name suggests, it's as cozy as your grandma's house, and chances are you'll walk by thinking it's someone's living room and not actually a wine bar. They've created such a comforting environment, each seat should come with an eye mask and neck pillow for napping purposes.

It's small, but they pack a punch with a menu of comfort foods like mac 'n' cheese, charcuterie boards, and fondue (on Tuesday's only) and a rotating cast of wines of all colors and varietals. Nab a seat near the fireplace to up the ante on hygge vibes and enjoy one of the warmest wine bars this side of the Catskills.

What a gem!  Super cozy inside, great little seating/waiting area outside. The server was very welcoming and gave us great suggestions.  We ordered the pork belly special with pureed sweet potatoes, the tuna nicoise salad and the salt cod and Artichoke.  We loved everything we ordered.  The one slight disappointment was that the salt cod was supposed to come with potatoes and came with bread instead (without anyone mentioning it) - but it was still very delicious.

Most amazing cavernous, cozy wine bar in BK. Every time we're in from LA, we beeline it to this sweet spot. Curl up by yourself and dive into your novel or meet a friend for an intimate chat. It's the loveliest!

Been wanting to try this place since the winter! Wine and cheese is an excellent way to start the night. I had the Georgian wine (yes the state Georgia) and the petite sirah. The Georgia wine was a bit bitter but warmed up to me after a while. Petite Sirah came from the California region. It was a sweet wine and I tasted black currants. It reminded me of Ribena.

For food we ordered the Charcuterie (meat platter) and Fromage cheese. You got to order the cheese! It spread and tasted like butter. All the meats on the meat platter were great. Tasted wonderful with the cheese we ordered.

Come here for cheese and wine! They have an amazing selection of beer and wines. Cheers

What a lovely place. Nice service. Friendly staff.

Cool small outdoor area in front with wooden chairs and tables.

Ok..they have a working fireplace!! Books and bottles of wine on the wall along with farm implements. Farmhouse feel and smell (of the fire). This was a welcome hours stop on a cold afternoon.

Primitivo wine, Brooklyn brown beer, cheese plate and charcuterie plate.  Was perfect!!!

Craving a weekend upstate but your exorbitant NYC rent is holding you back? Come to Black Mountain Wine House. You'll totally feel like you're in a cabin somewhere with a fireplace, even if it's the middle of July.

A first date brought me to this spot after I mentioned my admiration for wine. He was on point with that, I have to say (thanks Michael, if you're reading this).

It's super cozy here with dim lights and warm decor. You're tucked into a really good neighborhood so that somehow makes you feel even more cozy and safe and chill. The chairs at the bar have backs on them thankfully so that when you start feeling that second glass buzz you can relax.

I had a Pinot Grigio from France which was great. The glasses will range from $9 to $20 and a bottle can be double that if you're in need of some major TLC.

The bartender was attentive and didn't bother us. I did not have any food but I'd like to come back and try their bites.

Stumbled upon the best winter date spot in the area!! I've never heard of this place before, but I passed it on a walk from Carroll Gardens to ParkSlope and at first glance thought it was just an out of place cabin.
The interior is cozy and on a Friday around 7 there was no lack of seating! My boyfriend and I ordered a bottle of wine and sat back and enjoyed the scene. It's definitely a unique spot and excited to go back- I've noticed a lot of reviews on the Fondue, so gotta try it!!

Geography is such a funny animal in NYC.  After slavishly following my phone's directions and turning off of bustling, 5 bar-per-block Smith Street onto bucolic, brownstone-laden Union St., I couldn't have made it more than half a block without thinking to myself "This can't be right."  You couldn't have felt more distinctly as if you were leaving a Brooklyn neighborhood's commercial district for an exclusively residential one.

But deep down, I knew better than to ever question the scary accuracy of Google Maps.  Sure enough, another half block later, I stumbled upon the cutest little oasis of a storefront.  It looks almost as if someone dropped a little Adirondack cabin on the corner of Union and Hoyt.  The outdoor area is gated enough to feel like a private garden - it's quiet and lovely, and hard to believe you are having a drink on an NYC street corner.

The food is great, and quite reasonably priced.  All plates are $12 and range from amusingly named/described sandwiches (e.g., the BLAT - BLT+ Avocado on 12 grain or Tuna Nicoise featuring "Really expensive Canned Tuna") to Salads or small, hot plates.  What they really specialize in, though, are the important things in life, by which I obviously mean beer, wine and cheese.

The Black Mountain Mac & Cheese is stellar, with the truffle oil being an incredible, luxurious touch.  The cheese plate option is wonderful as well - 3 for $15 for a great assortment of carefully curated options.  The beer and wine lists are both excellent, with a diverse array of styles/varieties.  You won't fail to find something to thrill your unique palate and/or pair with anything on their diverse menu. seem designed to provide a wide array of options to properly pair with their excellent food.

At any rate, I was enchanted - BMWH is charming and cozy without feeling cramped or in any way pretentious.  From the outdoor garden/country cabin vibe to the inside fireplace & French boite feel, I can't imagine a better place to steal away with a loved one for an intimate date, or to gather with friends for a small-to-moderate sized party.  I can't wait to come back many, many times... in particular on a Tuesday to experience their Classic Swiss Fondue night!

Cutest little cafe type wine bar in Caroll Gardens.  Slightly off Smith so it doesn't have all that busy crowd.   Has a tiny seating area outside, it would be nice to have a glass of wine by the fire at night.  Inside is cozy, great for a date.  Atmosphere lighting and all.  I also saw a small birthday dinner in there so they can accommodate a small group it looks like.

Cheese platter - they have a variety of cheeses to chose from for your platter.  I didn't know all the different types they had and the waiter was really helpful with descriptions and helping me decide.

I also had the Mac n cheese (without truffle sauce!!!).  I was amazed and delighted they could do That!  It was a creamy sauce, but could have used a little breading on top some type of texture and baked after.  I love mac n cheese, order it almost always order it when available so I get picky over little things.

Wine was good, only tried one glass though.  I need to do a flight tasting next time.

This little hall in the wall in Gowanus literally took me 10 minutes to find as I paced back and forth looking for the entrance.  Once I finally went inside I realized how intimate the restaurant "seemed" as it packed to the brim with people.  I ordered a Portuguese Scrumpy Cider which was quite unusual and delicious.  I kind of had to be on top of the staff to make sure I got a table for my date and I as there were more people coming through the front door.  Once we sat down the restaurant no longer felt crowded and was an incredibly intimate setting, trading conversation over an excellent Argentine Malbec, various cheeses, and a charcuterie board with imported meats.  I can't speak higher of this local date place although I wouldn't necessarily plan my who dinner there.

Pork belly on mashed sweet potato is done to perfection. The bartendress gave excellent wine and food suggestions and was so nice. Think sitting at the bar is likely roomier than sitting at a table.

I went to black mountain wine house last night for some drinks and dinner. It's really cozy and intimate. It's a nice date spot. They have a nice wine list, and a good amount of beers as well. They only serve beer and wine.

We shared a BLAT, which was a BLT with avocado. It was good, the bread was toasted. We also shared truffle macaroni and cheese. It was delicious! It had mushrooms. I love anything with truffle. The service was very good. The server checked in and made sure we were ok with drinks.
Overall, it was a cute place. I would definitely return!

Extremely cozy spot with great small dishes to share and a fantastic wine selection.

Came here on a Saturday night as a group of 5 for a chill night, looking for some good snacks and a cool spot to share a couple bottles of wine - and that's exactly what we got. We arrived around  9PM and the place was full but not many people waiting. Put our names down, and the staff were super friendly as we waited - they promptly put wine glasses in our hand and kept us updated. It's such a small space though that standing with a glass of wine in your hand next to the wood burning fireplace waiting for a table made us feel like we were already seated. Food was delicious and reasonably priced, though the portions could be a little larger, or we could have gotten some guidance on how many to order for 5 people. Will definitely return.

A sweet, intimate place with great wine and light food. A great date spot. My boyfriend and I love this place, especially in the early afternoon before the dinner crowds. I don't think I would come here with a bigger group because there's kind of limited seating, but what a nice quiet date place!

Everything about this place is amazing! Great food and wine and the ambiance is excellent.

I docked a star for the service - particularly for the asian man with the bun. He was outwardly short, abrupt, and rude to us. From the beginning, even if we asked him questions regarding the menu or drinks he was absolutely the opposite of what this place is supposed to be - a good, relaxing time.

Not sure why he works here with a bad attitude, it was the LOW of our night - dealing with his behavior.

I'm hesitant to write a review for fear of this place getting popular, but here we go...

Talk about a hidden gem! You would never know that this is a restaurant & bar just by looking at it from the outside. It is so adorable and cozy - they even have a working fireplace which blows my mind! With lovely wine and mixed drinks plus a very nice happy hour and a good choice of tasty food to eat, this place has it all.

My friend and I met here after work one day for happy hour and some snacks just to chat and hang out. She got a couple glasses of muddled wine which was delicious and I went cup for cup with white wine. We split an order of spicy meatballs and a BLAT (bacon lettuce avocado and tomato sandwich). Both of these dishes were super tasty and very filling.

Please don't tell anyone about this place...I'm hoping to keep it a secret as long as I can! It seems to be a local spot that only a few people know, so let's keep it that way.

This is one of my favorite spots in the neighborhood. The wine is great, but also so is the food! I recommend the mac n cheese, meatballs, the BLAT and....those are the only things I ever get because they're consistently good.

Wine-wise: the Nebbiolo is a great red and the GrÃ¼ner are my go-tos.

Ambience is super cozy, especially in the winter with the fire going. Highly recommend this spot!

Absolutely loved this little cozy restaurant and wine bar.  We went here for Valentine's Day (actually, the night before) and the decor is simply cozy, adorable, classy and romantic. The lights are dimmed and the fireplace is crackling.  The wine display on the wall is beautifully done.  It was a bit crowded when we arrived but we found a seat within 10 minutes.   We were seated right next to the fireplace and the mood was simply perfect. We ordered some absolutely delicious wine and some tasty fondue (a treat on Tuesdays), which was delicious, but I would suggest an array of different fruits rather than just bread (which got a bit bland).

The Mac n Cheese was simply divine, with the gruyere cheese and truffle oil that gives it such a special and upscale flavor.  I cannot stay away from anything "truffle" on a menu! I was hesitant to try it, but the Goat Cheese Tart might even be my favorite item.  Neither my husband and I are a fan of beets, but with the goat cheese, it came together perfectly.

Although all the wines are tasty, I cannot describe how delectable the mulled wine was.  The flavors were amazing and it was the best mulled wine either of us has ever had in our life.  No aftertaste, no bitterness, simply a perfect blend of spices.  I'm dreaming of this mulled wine for days afterwards! I highly recommend this place for a sweet, romantic date night with your loved one!

A really cool out of the way type bar. You go there and you feel super local. There are a few wooden seats outside in the front that when you sit there, you feel as if you're on a neighborhood stoop. This is a perfect date spot to impress any date!

One of our favorite neighborhood go to's, especially in the winter -- so cozy in there you feel as though you've escaped to some cabin in New Hampshire.

Great food (portions are pretty big even though they are technically 'tapas sized') and perfect for a casual night out. Good wine options as well though sometimes a little hit or miss, could just be our personal preferences.

I love this place! I've been here twice and both times were great experiences. It's so homey and cozy inside, and looks like an adorable country cabin from the outside. Definitely a chill, relaxed vibe!
The food, wine, and service were great. Awesome selection of various cheeses to try. The meatballs and mac and cheese were also super yummy! Such a great wine bar, I'd definitely recommend!

Second time here and love it so much I almost don't want to let so many others know how wonderful it is. But they deserve it, so -

A mountain cabin hidden in a quiet neighborhood close to the Carroll St stop. Extensive wine list with affordable house options, hot mulled wine, AMAZING rotating menu churned out of a tiny kitchen, and a roaring fireplace in the winter. Incredibly attentive and beyond able small staff to man a busy Saturday night. They kept us updated as we were waiting for a table and bought us a glass on the house for our patience.

TLDR: Get the mulled wine and mac and cheese.

The only downside of an evening at Black Mountain Wine House is the possibility that a woman will instantly and urgently ask to change her table after you sit down near her. I'm fairly sure I showered that month, but I suppose the issue could've been my voice, my face, my intimidatingly acute fashion sense and/or my general joie de vivre.

Whatever it was, I was left to ponder why I was so repulsive for the rest of my night/life.

Luckily I was at Black Mountain Wine House, and this cozy, snug spot is the only thing that can cheer you up when a stranger so blatantly and immediately despises everything about you. Everything about this place is perfection. And I mean everything; this includes:

The fireplace.
The excellent wine list.
The excellent beer selection.
The friendly, attentive service.
The delicious, well-executed menu of small plates, like...
The mac n' cheese, the seared chorizo special and the wedge salad.
The rustic, spare decor, especially when combined with the down-home musical choices.

How can anyone not love this place? Tucked off the main drags of the area, it's the ideal date spot, and the neighborhood joint that everyone wishes they had on the corner.

Take your lady here and you will have to actually fight to preserve your virtue afterward, because just knowing about such a fantastic little place will ignite an uncontrollable attraction within anyone with any semblance of good taste.

Cozy spot for a nightcap or late night snack with your sweetie. It's dark, warm and perfect - like a log cabin in the middle of Carroll Gardens. I loved it! There are enough tables for a small dinner group, but I would recommend this place for a date, double date max. It's a super intimate vibe.

Ordered mulled wine and Rioja. My first glass of red must have been from an old bottle, cuz it tasted old and flat, but the next few glasses were perfect.

Beer, liquor, cheese plates. Front yard with Adirondack chairs for the smokers. The short menu enticing enough for next time. Noted: Fondue Tuesdays.

My mister man took me here for a simple and cozy anniversary dinner. Loved it so much. The cheese is fantastic and the wine. My goodness. I had the resiling - soooo perfect. Not too sweet not dry. Nice and crisp.

We will be coming back! Oh try the fondue, Mac & Cheese, and the Roasted tomatoes. You'll love.
