What an amazing place! All I can think of was why I didn't come here sooner! I came here on Friday evening with making reservations prior. From the food to the drinks to the music to the ambiance to the service, everything was absolutely amazing! Shout out to CAMRAN for being such an amazing waitress! She definitely made our experience better! The DJ played great music through out the night including throwbacks with Spanish, reggae, hip hop & r n b. It's a vibe out here.

Henny colada drink
Honey I can't elope drink
Volcano roll
Lobster Mac n cheese
Kobe sliders
Coconut shrimp

The drinks were made to perfection & looked so cute in the fruits! But I can't pick which food I liked more since they were all delicious & flavorful in their own ways! Worth every bite and sip!

OMG! Where do I start,my bff and I went to Kimoto for lunch and from the door to the restaurant  everyone was delightfully polite. Once inside the decor and staff was so welcoming, but I MUST give a HUGE shout out to Ryan the manager at Kimoto and Saira our server. What can I say Ryan stopped by our table to make sure we were comfortable,chat with us for awhile, spoke about the restaurant and you can feel the joy that he have working there which also reflect upon Saira, she was so attentive making sure we were not lacking anything.

Upon leaving we met a security guard omg polite and now I feel so bad I did not get a chance to ask him his name.

The food and drink sooo delicious

Overall superb staff, experience, food and ambiance. This restaurant has now become my to go restaurant and everyone I meet I make sure I tell them to go go go

KUDOS Ryan for doing such an EXTRAORDINARY job. I applaud you and your staff

Yeah, so, let's talk about Kimoto, and I hope the owners see this review and really take to heart how they can improve.

Me and my wife went for the first (and probably last) time the other night, and well. I guess I was under the impression it was more of a restaurant rather than a club. Honestly, I'm still not sure which one it is. We got pat down upon entry (like a club), the DJ was bumpin' 2000s hip hop (like a club), had a dress code and 21+ policy (like a club), but they served food and prohibited dancing (like a restaurant). It was very disjointed. That said, the decoration is cute, and the skyline views are adequate. The hosting and waitstaff are also remarkable, and I wouldn't change a thing there.

But let's talk about cost! We had to pay a $10/pp cover for our reservation, which a little ridiculous, and the food and cocktails were all heavily overpriced. They were above-average in quality, and if you are so flush with money, maybe spending $100 on two cocktails and two small appetizers may not be a big deal. Maybe that's their intended clientele. Cocktails ranged $17-$23, appetizers were $8-$15, and bigger plates were $20-$30. They also have hookah, which looked pretty tasty and quality (for like $40? though?) so this may be a decent spot for a hookah night. In addition to this, though, we were greeted with a "20% service charge" at the end of the meal. I assume (hope) this is an auto-gratuity that goes to our waitress (who was awesome), because it's VERY cheeky to request a tip on TOP of that. Like I said; we had two cocktails and two appetizers, did not leave any additional tip, and our little adventure cost over $100, which is an absurd cost.

Overall, my advice for the management, if you're trying to be a restaurant and not just a "club with food" or whatever:
* Keep your waitstaff. They are excellent. Very friendly and great service.
* Phrase "tip" as "add'tl tip", if the 20% service charge is indeed an automatic gratuity. Otherwise, eliminate that service charge, that's ridiculous.
* Eliminate the $10/pp cover. Get rid of the pat down. Lower the music volume just slightly.

This is an overrated venue. I've heard such great things about this establishment, however, upon my arrival on Labor Day itself I was highly disappointed. We were a party of 3 and were told at the entrance that bottle service was mandatory. Once we refused, we were ushered to a section near the dance floor (which was completely closed).

We were given menus and decided to order food, drinks, and hookah. The calamari was phenomenal along with the coconut shrimp. The hookah was strong and lasted for a long period of time (free refills). Despite my expectations, overall we did have a good time but this is not a place that I would come to regularly.

Disclaimer up front.  Do not come here if Marijuana is not your thing.

Always wanted to try Kimoto Rooftop.  Beautiful place, good service, average food.

So we went here with the expectation of it being a very business casual location.  Just look at the dress code.  When we got there, we were patted down for weapons?  Ok, not a big deal, it is an exposed rooftop so I understand the security measure.

So as we were seated, I noticed other groups were wearing sneakers, jeans, windbreakers, everything the dress code said not to wear.  Alright, I guess the rule didn't apply to them.

We ordered the Takoyaki, Fried Makarel, Chicken Slider, and Pretzel.

The Pretzel was the best dish.  Soft, a little too much salt in some spots, but came with dipping cheese and guac on the side.  Very tasty.

The Chicken sliders were underwhelming. Two small triangles of chicken in a small roll with greens and a dollop of guacamole.  It was dissappointingly dry.

The Takoyaki was not bad. The octopus was chewy and the batter was cooked well, although it tasted a little old.

The Fried Makarel was dry and salty.  The flavor was there, but I expected a moister fish, it tasted as if they rehydrated a dried piece of makarel, breaded and fried it.

The evening ended with one of our neighbors enjoying hookah, which was a nice aroma...  Until the other neighbors at a different setting decided to blaze.  Nothing like the pungent skunk odor and contradicting the dresscode to exemplify everything Kimoto Rooftop stands for.  Dried old fish pretending to be the catch of the day.

Came here for Valentine's day again. And again they had awesome music ranging from hip hop to smooth R&B to Frank Sinatra. My only suggestion for the music is to not play all the same type of song in a row but to mix it up. Like put the Frank Sinatra in between the R&B songs. Because at one point it was just getting to be too much of the same thing.

And again loved the decorations. Hearts and pink and red everywhere. But they had cheap balloons or something because the balloons by our table kept popping very loudly. Very distracting.

Unfortunately the food took 45 minutes. We sat down at 615 and didn't get our food until 715. Waitress apologized and gave us free shots of tequila. But I don't do shots so I didn't drink it. A price off the bill would have been better...

So deducting a star for the long wait plus the increase in prices!! Most things increased from 1 to 3 dollars since last year. The harujuku roll was 14 dollars last year and this year 17. And it didn't taste as good. It was super spicy which wasn't how it used to be. It has a spicy mayo on it in addition to the spicy tuna which is not what it specifies on the menu. Also they removed the Ice Water cocktail which I loved. We got the happy endings cocktail which was okay. They used cheap barefoot champagne in it. We had the bbq chicken sliders again which again were very good with not much meat on each. And we tried the caribbean roll which i liked best! Loved the shrimp tempura in it.

Also we didn't get to sit in the cool "lounge" area with the couches. I guess they just renamed that area the lounge. When my boyfriend went to reserve dinner he had an option for dinner or lounge. So of course he chose dinner. So bad word choice on the website. You can still get dinner in the lounge. And I suggest you book that. Its much more of a cool chill space. And has more greenery as well. The dinner section was right by the elevators and has cramped 12 tables In a 10 by 10 area.

Another reason this is losing a star is because we tried to come here with a group for dinner on a Sunday night and they were charging a 10 dollar cover and blasting club music! Its a Sunday night! I wanted a nice dinner with 6 people who we work with who were in town and so we went somewhere else. We couldn't even hear ourselves think. We expected that environment on a friday or Saturday but not a Sunday. They lost our business that night.

I think we will come back here next year for Valentine's though. Since the ambiance is great and I do love the music and food. Wish though the prices were the same as last year. And we will make sure we book the lounge next time!

Me and my boyfriend came here for two Valentine's Days. This year and last. I love what this restaurant did this Valentine's 2019. They made it really swanky with couches. Had red and pink heart decorations everywhere (but didn't over do it) and they had the best Valentine's day playlist. Everything from Frank Sinatra to R & B to 2000s pop. Such a great atmosphere.

Service is nice and attentive. Hostess is great. Told her we wanted to take pictures and she brought us outside in the freezing cold when she had a bare midriff top on and took the most georgeos pictures of us. Really made our night feel special.

We ordered the BBQ chicken sliders. The flavor was amazing. It hit my mouth with so much robust unique flavor. Not just pure BBQ but there was something else there. Though the amount of chicken is not even an ounce on each one. The amount of chicken is so small. Please put more chicken on so it fills the bun!

We had the rock shrimp appetizer which was good but for 16 dollars they should give more than 7 little popcorn shrimp.

Drinks were delicious. All the cocktails where great, loved the 'Ice Water' cocktsil. It has aloe in it which makes it taste so fresh and refreshing. And not overly sweet.

The sushi was great, we ordered the harajuku roll which was delicious (8 maki). Fresh mango and salmon. And only 14 dollars. Cheaper and more filling than the rock shrimp.

I will come back again next year for Valentine's. Please stick with that playlist and atmosphere. But put more chicken on those sliders!

Overall, this was a good experience. Reservations are required and there is a strict dress code but at least you know you'll have a table and be comfortable. We had 6 people in our party but our table was a little small for the party. It's more of a lounge setup too.. so the height of the table isn't necessarily conducive to eating. The food was good but not spectacular, so we definitely tried to get our money's worth by drinking as much unlimited mimosas as possible. The staff was attentive and got us new pitchers upon request.

Came here for my anniversary, it was the worse experience ever. My waitress and hostess is rude and no good customer skills. Next we notice Friday is cheaper and if you book online they charging you $300 to reserve . Then they put us at a small table, where I hit my damn shoulder because of the shelf on the wall and have the nerve to bring a small table beside us for hookah but I decline . Nobody was 6ft apart everybody was close to each other . There was no  social distancing and I have videos . It was more than 25% capacity and the ambiance isn't all that trust me . My husband got food poisoning and was vomiting for 3 hrs straight . Basically this spot was a waste of money and I will never do anything here again. Wasn't worth the money and will not recommend this place to anyone . Oh yeah , let's not forget all the ganja smoking that we started smelling smh.

Kimoto was a great experience.  At a premium price you can get an amazing view of Brooklyn, food and drinks all in one place.  My girlfriend and I enjoyed the sangria as well as the dumpling appetizer and a noodle dish.  We would recommend this for anyone looking for a celebration or a fancier meal!

Came here on a Thursday night with my friends. We called in advance and were sent a picture of our seating. When we arrived we were instead sat at two bar tables which were not very comfortable. The music was too loud to have a conversation. If you are looking for more of a club this would probably work. But not for a dinner. It also did not feel safe with tables close together and some of the staff not wearing masks. We mostly ordered appetizers to share. The food was fine. There is also a 10$ cover fee.

I came here for brunch to celebrate a friends birthday. We had reservations for 3:30pm and did not get seated until 5pm. So What was the point of the reservation!? We were seated in area and one of the girls in our party had to sit on a "stool" that looked more like an end table. The area in which we were seated did not comfortable seat the amount of people in my party but that's besides the point. After asking to speak to the manager to express how upset we were about the wait we were given two rounds of shots. Not like a shot in a glass shot glass but the little plastic shot glasses. It was free so I can't complain much but still. Being that we were seated at 5pm we couldn't order from the brunch menu which is what we had our hearts set on. Upon being seated they left us plates and utensils but didn't give us glasses for water (which was brought to us) until we requested them.

Moving on to the food: I had the chicken Alfredo which was very subpar. The chicken was unseasoned and dry

Moving on to the drinks: they have a DIY mimosa bar during brunch hours. As it got closer to brunch ending they did not replenish supplies which is a bit disappointing, you should keep the area stocked until the brunch time ends. So you make your own mimosa and they have sangria there as well. In order for me to make my own mimosa I do need a glass, my friend had to request a glass at the bar because they didn't have any by the mimosa station. I do like the idea of make your own mimosa however, there should be someone there monitoring if there is enough juice and glasses at all times so they can keep it stocked up. I had a rum punch which was very weak. My friend had a drink called "pop in the name of love" it came in a champagne flute and was hot. Not warm but hot. Who wants to drink a hot beverage?

Parking: there's about 2-3 parking garages within the vicinity that are about 2-4 blocks away.

Atmosphere: the view of the city is beautiful! The actual interior was okay. The couches are pretty low so if you're tall, you have a looooonggggg way down.

Overall 2/5 stars. Not too sure if I'd come back though.

This rooftop owes me a $150 refund and has been ducking my attempts to get in touch. I was came to the rooftop on Saturday September 5 for a sushi dinner. The website advertises sushi dinner. Before arriving, I had to make a $150 payment to reserve my table for 2 people. However, bc of Covid the rooftop no longer offers sushi. Makes sense, but there was no way of a patron like me to know that beforehand. I decided to leave the rooftop in search of sushi. A young lady downstairs said I'd be refunded my $150 payment, but it's been over a week and still no refund. (Also the rooftop was really loud, should lower the music).

Bought tickets for a Fever open bar event and came here to find bartenders unaware of what's going on. The event was from 6-8pm but the bartender thought the open bar ended at 7 so they wouldn't give me drinks until they've spoken with the manager.

Venue. It's a rooftop bar with obstructed views from new developments nearby. It's still a good location for a rooftop bar nonetheless. I liked the ambiance, they were playing reggae and souka and I would have loved for the place to turn into a dance floor.

Food. Food was surprisingly good. My favorite was the yellowfin tuna. Next favorite was the truffle fries that came with a variety of dips. We ordered around 8 appetizers - split among 3 girls we paid $36 each including service charge. For the amount of food we had, it wasn't bad at all.

Service. I was turned off by the bartenders and how clueless they seemed to be. It was also weird that the waitress couldn't bring us drinks to our table. Besides that, the waitress was very attentive and so were the servers. They cleared our table when we needed more space and was available when we needed something.

Crowd. The crowd was a little odd. We were told that we can only keep our table until 8 because they have reservations but at 8pm on a Friday night it was hardly crowded. This place seems to be an Instagram spot for influencers because one of the tables next to us did nothing but took turns taking pictures all night. The table across us also mistakenly exchanged my drink with hers - good thing we still had the open bar so I was able to replace my drink.

It was an entertaining experience though this is probably not the spot i would hang out in. Love the music and ambiance but this place needs a lot of improvement on service.

This place is simply OK. I would return and try it again for a date, possibly or as a smaller group but as a large party, not worth it. We got there on a Saturday evening around 7pm for a friend's birthday. When booking, we were told there doesn't have to be a table minimum as long as everyone is ordering drinks and hookah but later on, it changed to "must get bottle service". Okay cool, bottle service it is! Paid around $700 for 2 medium bottles (tequila + jack). You'd think the service would be impeccable but the servers seemed impatient to constantly clear the table and they took 2 drinks that still had alcohol in them. We also went to the bar and ordered extra drinks and the bartender had a nasty attitude "what do you want, hurry up" like, can I have 5 seconds to glance at the menu? They're also served in plastic cups with a price tag of $14.

We also got some fries and calamari, and 3 hookahs. The hookahs were your basic flavors but lasted pretty long and the coal changer (Farhan) was very nice to us and came around often. The hookah quality was better than I expected. The fries and calamari were both delicious but portions seemed on the smaller side.

Make sure to use the bathroom before you get here cus the lines get hectic! The atmosphere is nice and the decor is beautiful. We left with a bill of around $1000 and while there were certain shortcomings, I'd possibly come back to try it again

This spot is a fabulous place to sit at the bar, take in the extraordinary view, and hear some loud, lively music. It's a scene filled with action and energy. The food is only fair and quite disappointing. If you have enough of the tasty drinks, you won't notice, yet with the NYC prices, I expected better quality. The gyoza dumplings were terribly over cooked. I expected a dough that was soft and firm, not deep fried and crispy. The crispy rice sushi did not have sushi rice. The spicy tuna was served on what could have been rice cakes. The texture of both dishes were severe enough that I feared cracking a tooth! The jalapeño was a nice touch on the sushi, but the sauce provided was insufficient to use for the whole dish, and getting the attention of the waitstaff was a lengthy process.  Final assesment: go for the bar, dancing, and view. Eat somewhere else before you g

Let's be real. Decor is gorgeous.

For a hotel rooftop restaurant I am really impressed at the layout of the space and the overall aesthetics. The seating is broken down into lounge and table seating we close lounge because of the people watching capacity. Just kidding. But really the lounge seating is very comfortable.
There are vines and strings of lights and paper lanterns that give a relaxed nature vibe. Really beautiful.

Food. We ordered the Truffle Parm Fries, Spicy Tuna Pizza, Crab Rangoon and the Seaweed Salad. All tasted good. The presentation was pleasing to the eye. The best of the four was a tie between the Rangoon which had a heavy celery presence that I liked and the spicy tuna pizza because who doesn't like spicy tuna.  I think the price point is dancing along the verge of overpriced however I can see for being a hotel restaurant and a rooftop where the pricing is coming from. The happy hour before 7 for margaritas was great. $6 each!

Overall it was a lovely experience. I would probably try another rooftop next time but it is def a great date or chill happy hour spot if you are in the area!

Horrible experience. I was turned away because my shoes did not have a back piece which does not adhere to the dress code which I understood was my mistake. I was completely okay with not being let in but as soon as I requested a refund I was told to stand to the side while they ask the manager for a refund. After waiting 20 mins the manager did not come down to talk to me and simply stated to cancel my reservation online to reverse the charge. I did exactly that and now days later still no refund. I am not being told that I have to email someone to get my refund of $200.
This is an extremely unprofessional establishment that wants to change its image to being more upscale however the staff itself is unprofessional and changing the dress code isn't going to disguise that.
If they are so quick to turn people away why aren't they willingly to give refunds?

I must first say the food is amazing!

I love their variety and being in a mix group of friends of meat eaters and vegetarians we all had many options.

However its disappointing that when reserving a table they make you pay 10.00 for each person. If you arrive after a certain time and they are having rooftop you might end up paying extra...up 20bucks for men.

After booking a table for three we were seated in a small side table setting with no room for sitting or eating comfortably. I think if someone pays for a table they should give a decent table not squeezed make shift seating. Esp since gratuity added into check and the food will be pricey for some.

Again if the seating arrangements were better I'd def give them a 5star rating.

Celebrated a friends birthday here and loved my experience. The venue is  absolutely beautiful and on a weekday completely empty, we literally had the entire rooftop to ourselves. The food was delicious, I enjoyed the Heavenly coco roll and the mermaid roll both were recommended by the server and definitely a must try.The drinks were great, I had The Brooklyn bridge, it's served in a  pineapple shell, it definitely made a great photo op. The staff here were awesome, the manager came over and gave the birthday boy a celebratory shot with sparklers definitely made an amazing memorable experience .

Won't be coming back. Was advertised as outdoor seating but instead was put in a plastic pod with another couple even though I had a reservation. Staff wore no masks. Bouncer aggressively patted me down before we went inside. Not safe or accommodating for Covid. Walked out after 5 minutes.

The best thing about going about this place is the rooftop view.

I stayed at the Aloft hotel and really wanted to check this place out and try the food as there wasn't a lot of food spots that stayed open late in the area. We tried to come up for food on a Saturday night and were told we had to pay just to get in for some food. Mind you, this is the only restaurant option in the hotel.

We tried to come again during the week to check it out. It's an ok place but between the prices and less than enthusiastic vibe from the wait staff,  it was just ok.

The atmosphere and view of the rooftop is amazing. I gave it three stars because the service and food were both mediocre. They took a while to seat us and the waitress took forever to take our order. We ordered the calamari and crab cakes and both arrived without sauce. Then we ordered the shrimp fried rice and it lacked seasoning and flavor. It started raining so we asked to be seated inside and the manager told us NO but then said we can sit inside if we carry the outdoor furniture in ourselves. I wasn't impressed and I'm not sure if I would visit again.

So much potential... very disappointing.

Don't waste your time eating here. Food was like it came from a mall food court. Which is ironic because the City Pointe at Fulton Mall is a phenomenal food experience and just a couple blocks away. Save yourself the disappointment and head there instead.

Didn't have drinks. Maybe they are fantastic

I came here for dinner and drinks because my friend recommended it after she went on a date here.

Views? . Food? . Drinks?

The food was pretty good. I got the Jap chae and one of the sushi rolls which was pretty good. I'd give both a 8/10.

The cocktails really won be over because I felt that they were so creative (I got some lychee one).

My friends and I also ordered a huge Moscow mule, which seemed watered down but that's what expected at bars these days (shrugs)

The service was also amazing and so accommodating. We got seated indoors first, but we wanted to sit outside on the roof so they moved us :) our waitress was also super sweet and amazing (I forgot her name but she had cool tats :) )

Went here during a weekday during the day with my boyfriend. It was very calm and I really liked the rooftop decor. The space was very open and clean.

I ordered the shrimp teriyaki, which tasted very fresh and the broccoli could've been steamed much longer. The service was fine though. I would like to return at night to have a feel of their nightlife.

i wish i could give this place 3.5 stars. Kimono was a beautiful restaurant with a view of the statue of liberty and the food that we had was really good.  i'm a picky eater when it comes to asian fusion but there were many things that i wanted to try. i was very impressed with the crab cakes and a decent happy hour, that changes daily.... we also got a very fresh mango chicken teriyaki salad and teriyaki shrimp, which were also delicious.

for drinks, the strawberry margarita was super fresh and only $8 on happy hour.

however,we started with a $14 drink called the elite which was made of ciroc apple, prosseco, apple picker and supposed to come with kiwi boba balls... instead they were out at the bar of the boba balls and our waitress failed to tell us that or even apologize to ask if we'd like something different until we asked her where they were... that was very awkward, because we ordered that particular drink because the boba balls were a unique touch. with out, it was just a sugary acid green drink that made everything sticky.

we were also in part of the roof where they had these clear tent like dividers that made the place like a sauna since no breeze could get through. we were so hot, and there was a fan pointing inside, so we asked if she could bring it out here, cuz we were in direct sun with no air, and she said it had to stay inside, though it was 5 feet away. another waiter moved it out to us and we were grateful for him.

another weird thing was the hostess kept coming to take our menu... like normally at a lounge, they leave a drink menu to make it easy to make your next drink decision. we were there to lounge, and order food as we pleased, but it was awkward cuz the hostesses came by asking to take first the food then the drink menu. get your hostesses some more menus... it wasn't so busy, that they should be running out

I went yesterday for brunch and I must say I enjoyed myself. The energy and the ambiance is different yet refreshing.  The menu is very limited or brunch I think it's like 5 items but the avacado toast was AMAZING!!! The 1.5 unlimited drinks must have started once we sat down and actually was able to place our orders but it was a decent spot. I definitely have to try it after 4 when the menu is different but I'll definitely be back. Limited menu with good food and a good scenery is a perfect way to brunch. Minus the cold coffee waiting forever for a waitress and unlimited drinks which only felt like an hour I enjoyed myself

The music was great! I loved the ambiance. The soy garlic wings were good. The manager came to our table to check if everything was okay and provided us with a charger when our phones died. If you like hookah, they have that available as well. I highly recommend.

I came to this establishment under a different name years ago. I remember being nervous because they had only one elevator taking you to the rooftop and I felt trapped. When I was invited here by friends, I was skeptical but I obliged.  Glad I did. The main hotel elevators now all guests to go to the rooftop. The ambience was incredible. We sat in a booth-like area while sipping drink, nibbling on appetizers and smoking hooka. The DJ kept the music flowing. I came directly after work so it was a calm setting, but by the time we left around 9 pm, it was evident the vibe was turning party-ish.  Glad I got out when I did. Lol

This place is a few short blocks from work, so I'll definitely return for some summer night excursions.

Definitely a good turn up spot Monday through Thursday mid day until night time. Came on a Thursday night. Hookah is a must the mint flavor was phenomenal and the drinks you can't go bad with. It get really pack on a Thursday night so try to go early to get a good view and hold your spot.

Cute chill spot. The scenery is beautiful. I like the appetizers rather than the entree. I ordered the crab fried rice, which didn't have much taste to it. Their chicken salad and Korean bbq wings are good.

This is my 1st time coming here since this rooftop was renovated. Definitely enjoyed everything about this restaurant as I came here for a friends birthday. Went on a Saturday night as they had a live DJ, and hookah, to go along with signature drinks. Even with a party going on, there was still another part of the restaurant made for people who choose to dine in. The great view of downtown BK while on the rooftop is also a plus that adds to the experience of the place. I would recommend this place and I definitely will be coming back.

It was a very nice outdoor setting.
But our waitress was MIA most of the time barely checked on us to see how we were doing nor ask how was the food where it arrived.
Decent price, the drinks was the best part

I made a reservation here before reading any reviews. I am not a seafood/sushi eater but my partner is. Going over the menu I saw this place had the best of both worlds. A lot of reviews mention poor service. I wouldn't say I agree just because it is a lounge, not a place that is trying to move tables quickly. With that being said, don't expect to be in and out of here. I got the alfrado, it was okay I wasn't expecting much being that this is a sushi place. My partner got two rolls, one with cooked shrimp and another with raw salmon and tuna. The salmon in his roll was bad, he couldn't eat it and we had to send it back. They were nice and took it off the check no problem.

Other then that, it is a nice spot, strong drinks and reservations are almost always needed to get a spot!

Cool spot... has a nice view.

Tried one of their cocktails with Hennessy and pear puree -- it was really nice the first time around, but not as good the second time. Not a fan of inconsistent cocktails, but the bar was crowded so the bartender was moving really quickly to tend to folks.

Had the cheese flatbread... it was really just a cheese pizza. It was good, but nothing to write home about. Can't really go wrong with cheese on bread.

Ladies at coat check were really nice. Bartender was neutral -- again, busy and seemed to just be trying to get his job done.

Would go back again if I'm in the area, but wouldn't be my first choice.
