Thursday takeaway dinner for two.

4 stars for solid food but 3 stars for service although the host was super nice. Really cute set up for outdoor seating with plants and hooks on the wooden partitions for your bags - chairs/tables are school chairs where the table connects. Very nostalgic.

Ordered a chicken sandwich and the burger which were both delicious! The shoestring fries were plenty but a bit drenched in oil.

A few complaints - the noise of the trains going over every few minutes; the sour server (still gave a good tip even though we took our food to-go) - maybe he was in a bad mood/irritated because of the constant overhead train noise. And I ordered a medium burger and I got medium-well and was missing PICKLES! Where are my pickles???

We had drinks while we waited - paloma was decent. Would be back for takeout again if I was very hungry.

This place makes a nice fresh piece of salmon. I often have it delivered or pick up.  There's also a good vibe inside (huge space) around the pool table.

Superfine is now my favorite restaurant in Brooklyn!  Their burger is outstanding but so is everything else I've tried.  It's one of those menus that is tricky because you want to try everything but it's hard to stop ordering your favorites.  The staff is also amazing- they're warm and friendly and treat you like an old friend.  I also recommend picking up items from their grocery, especially the farm fresh eggs and homemade tortillas.

I am temporarily staying in Dumbo during Covid and Superfine is the highlight of my experience.  I look forward to returning when the dining room is filled and there is live music on stage, but for now I am so thankful they're open and making sacrifices to serve the neighborhood!

I have come to this restaurant in the past with friends and loved it but then came in with some friends for a birthday dinner and was pretty disappointed. They were pretty busy however our server did not bring us water for a good 20 minutes after being seated not did he offer to take our drink order until our entire party had arrived.
We kept trying to flag down servers or server assistants but we were ignored by all of them. Finally over an hour later our server took our order.
The appetizer portions were tiny! Not how I remember them being at all. It was a real shame because our bill was close to $300 for a few plates of appetizers that left us all hungry!

The music was good and so were the drinks but they came out after our food did.

Some silverware, glasses and water were missing from our table for far too long so I got up and asked the bar tender for them because our server was clearly too preoccupied with about 20 other tables. Food we never ordered kept being sent to our table and at the end we noticed our bill was completely wrong.

Who is managing this restaurant? The servers need much better training and the chef needs to not prepare tiny portions if this restaurant wants to stand a chance.

It will be a while before I come back. If I ever do it will be at the bar and I won't order anything other then a burger and cocktail.

Everything was great except the fact that it's literally under the train by the bridge. It's soo loud you have to stop talking until they pass. It's literally like every 3 minutes. In any event, this is beyond their control. The drinks were good and the service was lovely. It's still worth it despite the noise

We had the most incredible time here! We were a group of six of a chilly night and needed a place for dinner after walking across the Brooklyn Bridge. Nothing seemed to be open. It seemed kinda like a shady area and we were starting to get worried lol. We were standing right near this place when some guy that was smoking just outside walked in and we heard music! We asked if it was a restaurant or just a bar and he informed us it was a full restaurant. After not finding anything ourselves, we figured we'd try it out and get out of the cold. We had no idea what we were in store for!

They didn't have seating available so we waited and got a chance to look around. The place is funky with ramps and stairs and a stage and there was a live band that played the most fun music as well as Christmas music (we were there in December so it was totally appropriate lol). The servers were singing and dancing and just having a great time. I was so excited and almost didn't even care if the food was any good. I was waiting for a table and already having a great time!

They walked us up the ramp and sat us near the pool table! So fun! We had a great view of the place from where we sat and you can tell everyone was enjoying themselves! A quick scan at the drinks and food menus and our orders were placed. The drinks were a huge hit from the get-go! And the food?! INCREDIBLE! Y'all, I just about licked my plate! I had chicken and spinach and potatoes and ate.it.all!! I mean every bit I could scrape off with my fork! Everyone enjoyed their food and we stayed for quite a while singing and dancing in our seats! You can tell the employees enjoy working there and I'm sure they have regulars! I sure would be if I found myself in DUMBO often!

This will be a must-stop for me any time I'm in NYC!! Can't wait to go back and try something new! I've been telling everyone about it that I know is going to New York! Seriously, it's that good! Great food, great service, great fun and ambiance! Can't ask for much more! Bookmark it and go! Trust me!!!!! (And take me with you!!!!) :D

I came here for a live show. I liked the sunken bar in theory, but the layout was a little odd. You're funneled in single file, it makes it hard to see the music or interact with people. All around the sunken bar area are tables, which made it seem more like a restaurant. The stage area was very small. The owner was encouraging people to dance but there were tables everywhere. Because it seemed to have more of a restaurant layout people weren't really mingling. There was a pool table so that's cool.

I really liked the music they played in-between the bands sets, and I'm not sure if that's their regular music or if they were playing to the crowd for that night: Stray Cats, Chuck Berry, Run Around Sue. I'd come back for something specific.

Where else but at Superfine will you find a great late-night spot with a pool table?

The bartenders here are extremely quick and friendly. Great craft beer and signature cocktails as well.

Didn't try any of their food, but, had a great time listening to great music and beating every challenger in 8ball.

I especially love how clean this place is and how the uneven bar is almost something out of an Olympics gymnastics rendition.

Great ambiance and lovely vibe.

Updated Review (2019)

I can say that this place is now 'super'. An 8-member group of us had brunch here, and I will say that the service and food were definitely top-notch. I do not think there were any complaints within the group about our dining experience. My small complaint is that the live band is a bit loud, but the kids in the restaurant seem to like it. Note: the restaurant is very kid-friendly. Also, I called the restaurant and the hostess, who was working brunch on 9/1, was super (see what I did ;) ), friendly and accommodating.

If you are super hungry at brunch, I would highly recommend getting the pork chops and eggs. Man, that pork chop was HUGE and beautifully prepared.

I do not know about the super part.

I will say that the bar/restaurant has a really cool layout and the decor is very artistic. The place kind of has a fusion between the old and new school in terms of decor. It seems that this place invites a very diverse group of people, which is one of the things that I love about New York (but we are seeing less of in the city).  I did not experience the food here, although the pictures of the pork chops look pretty amazing. Superfine has a very nice list of beers and cocktails, so everyone can find something that they like.

Although the bartenders were very nice, the service could have been a little better. Even though we are sitting at the bar, it seemed like we had to shoot a flare gun in the air to get any of the bartenders' attention. I think that many folks from the neighborhood hang out at Superfine, which is cool, and the bartenders were chatting with them. I mean they weren't extended conversations but it felt like we were waiting a long time to get acknowledged for ordering drinks.

This is my third time here, and the excellence of this place is consistent. I am from the West Coast and make a special trip to Brooklyn just to visit this restaurant. The food is OUTSTANDING and the ambiance is cool. The clientele is a wonderful mix of super gay, to average 30 year olds, to business people.

This is the kind of place that will never ask you how you want your steak cooked, because it's going to come out medium rare... after all, that's how steak should be cooked. If you are picky or finicky or always modify your food, this place is NOT for you. The menu is small like all farm-to-table restaurants should be, and has been different every time I've been here.

The only reason this place gets 4 stars instead of 5, is because the service is not warm and friendly. However, I've sat at the bar all three times I've been here, so I can't speak for the dining room servers. The bartenders act like they don't really care whether you're there or not, and they never check on you after you get your food (probably because they know it's going to be good). But your beer is always full and the food comes out quick. Maybe it's because I'm clearly an outsider? Maybe it's because they're always so busy that they don't need my business? Maybe that's just Brooklyn? Either way, I'm not mad about it.

I will continue to come here because I love it.

We were sent here from Olympia Wine Bar by the bartender, and we are SO glad we listened to her recommendation! They had open mic/jams with the house band, great wine and delicious food. Fun bar ambiance in the sunken bar below the restaurant portion. Loud but fun atmosphere. Great spot for Wednesday night fun in Dumbo!

This was my first time here and it was surely a treat! There was a live band and a nice crowd because of the soccer game. It was a little noisy but given the circumstances of the game, why wouldn't it be? If sound bothers you though that's something to consider because of the live music. The servers and staff were so friendly. I felt comfortable and really enjoyed the atmosphere! The table was constantly checked on. A partner from the restaurant even came over and gave my friend a complimentary drink for his birthday and dessert which was so sweet!!!

Okay now for the food. I got the special pancakes which were cherries. THE BOMB! I really had to slow myself down from eating too fast lol the steak and eggs was also delicious. It was cooked exactly to order. All of the table was satisfied with their food and drinks. I will definitely be back. Such a cute, comfy, and safe spot !!

Sunday brunch review

The food is nothing special, what ppl come here for is the live music. This Sunday feb. 17th they had a band from Alabama, interesting music.

The drinks are watered down and cost just as much as everywhere else. The mojito is lime juice with ice and almost no liquor. However, the pool table comes in handy if you want some healthy competition.

Overall, wouldn't come by here again. Just because the drinks were sucky.
2.5 stars because apart from the live music they have decent beers and the waiters were friendly.

This was a lunch stop, after exploring Brooklyn bridge and Dumbo. It was so incredibly hot so I wanted to find a place to sit inside and chill. My brother found here using google, I have yet to get him to get on the yelp trend.
Superfine is in what looks like a converted wear-house, all the exposed brick is awesome.
They also had a featured artist that was space and Bond girls. In the front there's your traditional bar lots of tables we were placed up at a 2 top away from the middle which was nice to be able to observe the surrounding people and look into the kitchen, I love to watch people cook so it was awesome.
My drink was delicious! It was a Tom Collins but made with gin, refreshingly perfect on a hot day.
Lunch was awesome! I had a fresh vegetable medley, along with a delicious cornbread cake esq thing, I can't remember the specific name but it was delicious! I'll be back the food looked like there were many good choices and I think they have brunch!

This was a nice place to stop for brunch after a morning run in DUMBO. The menu wasn't very extensive or creative, but the prices are fair and the food is good. I especially liked the breakfast potatoes. We were seated up front by the bluegrass duo that was playing, and I thought that added a fun, unique aspect to the brunch.

Superfine might be superfine because it's in Dumbo and by the East River but it isn't all that fine when the food you ask for isn't available and the food itself isn't all that super.

Details:
I came here for Brunch around 1PM with two other friends. It's quite spacious and there's even a stage for live music. Amaze. A band was playing folk / country music and it was really sweet. And our waitress was sweet. But that it is folks - nothing too "WOW" ing.

Food is average. The brunch/lunch food is mostly tex-mex feel and good ol' chunks of meat and omelette. They didn't have sausage when I went. The side order of bacon was really disappointing because I could have made juicer bacon at home. My friend who had chicken enchilada said the chicken tasted really fake, but the beans were good. Oatmeal was average. Omelette was mediocre because it didn't have any distinct taste - I had to think why I was eating an omelette that tasted like nothing. The potatoes were good.  My other friend who had pork chops said it was pretty good.

Also, two of the three drinks we ordered weren't available.

It was below average to average feel of an experience.

Came for Sunday brunch and everything was great! Atmosphere, food and music.  One of the owners came around and was very welcoming and warm.  We came during the women's soccer final, so the crowd was great and energetic. It's kid friendly but great if you just want to go with friends or a partner. I had the buttermilk pancakes and they were GREAT!

I would also recommend the mimosa with brunch!

OMG!  Wish I could add 10 more stars to this place.  Had to look for a quick place to eat and nothing in the area was quite as inviting and perfect as this place.  So unassuming.  Had the best rib-eye ever!  And I mean ever!  Cooked to perfection and the sides are bar none mouth watering delicious.

Service is spot on friendly and perfect.  Checked in on us at the perfect time.  Pricing for the quality of the food is just right.  Fantastic selection of alcoholic beverages too.

Bar area is quaint, dining area is plentiful.  Parking is on the street, but was easy for me to find a parking one block away.  Worth it!  Don't walk, run to have a yummy dinner here.  You won't regret it!

Love this place! Been a regular here for roughly 4 years. Know some of the staff. Worked with some of the staff on side projects.

Came in here with a friend recently and had a great time. We paid our tab, I went to the bathroom came back, my friend went to the bathroom, I took a sip of my full water and the older male barback/bartender with the salt and pepper beard on September 29th at roughly 4 pm bussed my full water immediately after I took a sip... I mean I know I paid my tab but I'm not suddenly chop liver buddy... and to take the water away so abruptly and then practically snap a 'thanks goodbye' at me... made it seem like I had stiffed him on the tab or something when I left way over 20% in cash. I'm in the industry, I know what tips mean.

Anyway, we left, toured my friend through my old stomping grounds and came back for a game of pool and enjoyed some of Christina's company which refreshed at least my experience...

Great spot in Dumbo for brunch.

Food was killer and there's a pool table, although I don't know if you can play during brunch. Mens has something for everyone. Nice couple of beers to choose from and full liquor bar.

This place has a feel that the space hasn't changed much since back in the day. I love that. It is right under the bridge,​ so truly Dumbo.

Great location. Awesome decor and staff. Food was good and the drinks as well. We ordered chicken wings and the shrimp tacos. Both which were amazing. Drinks were very good and well made as well. Our bartender was awesome, we didn't appreciate her co-worker coming up to her holding a cigarette as we were trying to have a conv with her to talk about professional issues that were meant for behind closed doors.

Really cool bar ambiance with fun paintings on the wall. The bar area is definitely more of a stand and mingle around.

Made a reservation 3 days earlier and came with 16 people for a large group work event. Even though we were 20 minutes late due to the rainy weather, staff was super accommodating.

They took our app orders, then drink orders, then our entree orders. Everything came out promptly and together, so nobody was left without their order. We did have to shuffle a few plates around so everyone got the correct order, but understandable bc we were a large group. Food was delicious and they have vegetarian and gluten-free options for those with dietary restrictions. The pork chop was amazing. The fries were DELCIOUS (and also gluten-free).

Only hiccup: Given our large group size, there was a 2 person table added at the end. We had 2 people running late. A staff member stopped by multiple times to ask if we still needed the table. However, one of the people running late could no longer make it and there was an open chair at the other end of the table, so we could make do without the added table. The third time the staff member asked about the open table, we initially said we still needed it, but one of our party spotted the open chair at the other end, so we told the staff member they could take the table. The reply was a sarcastic "No, you clearly need it", which was the only off putting part about dinner. We were a little surprised given how good the rest of the service was that night. We ended up keeping the table and our late party member sat there, so it was put to use.

Overall, a good experience and thank you Superfine for putting up with a large group.

Enjoyed a delicious produce-forward meal here for my birthday last night. The food was delicious and the service was even better - huge thank you to the lovely lady who made it a meal to remember! I was flattered by efforts to make it extra special with a dessert, happy birthday vocal support and the kind gesture of a drink on the house.... A memorable evening indeed!

Came here for a me date Memorial Day weekend. Kentucky lemonade, (bourbon and sugar on the rim!) and Frittata. Perfect portions. So many places just give so much food, and seriously, how many times do people actually eat their doggy bag leftovers? Also, when you check in, FREE GLASS OF WINE. Come on, how can you loose?? Love the vintage touches too, and fresh flowers!! TREAT YOSELF!!!
(Also, they didn't mind that I brought my half drank iced coffee, some places are weird about that).

Came here on a spontaneous date on Friday and had a wonderful experience. The vibe was super cool and the staff was great. Food was mediocre we ordered the artichoke salad, grilled calamari and fries - we were pretty full on the drinks which were on point. We tried a few of the drinks honestly all of them tasted great you can't go wrong. Def would come here again.

On a rainy Sunday, while visiting Brooklyn, we stumbled upon this "superfine" restaurant! So happy we did, as the place is very cool! Great band playing, service was so friendly and our food was pretty dang good, too! Not a huge fan of the Bloody Mary, but I'm in Southern California and it's difficult to beat our Bloody's here;) overall, fab experience and we will return on our next NY visit!

Been going to Superfine since they opened years ago and have always enjoyed it. Have not been there in a while due to friends wanting to try other spots in Dumbo and Brooklyn Heights. I was happy when a friend suggested Superfine for Sunday brunch because I missed the place. I really wanted to write this review to simply say this: After all these years, the food at Superfine is as top notch as ever and the staff is so cool, friendly and warm. With so many restaurants that have difficulty maintaining food quality and service levels over time, it's nice to know that Superfine remains as great today as when it first opened.

This places rating needs to come down, seriously. Great venue but terrible food and ridiculously overpriced drinks. A great time is dampened by an exorbitant bill in the end.

I stopped in to Superfine when they first opened. They had another smaller location in the neighborhood they outgrew so I already thought the food was amazing. This space was much bigger and they made the food taste even better. Now about 15 years since I was last there it's just as good! Plus they serve alcohol.

The way they designed the interior around what used to be a loading dock makes it wonderfully unique!

Stopped in for brunch on a Sunday and wasn't able to have a conversation with my friend over the music. Food was fine, but nothing memorable. Probably wouldn't go again if I wanted to speak to anyone else or hear myself think.

Haven't had a brunch this bad in a while. It honestly felt like brunch from Hell. We came in on a Sunday when they had a live bluegrass band playing. Totally a preference thing, but I personally find this genre absolutely grating. The type of music you start making when you've been in isolation and inbreeding hard. Anyway, this review isn't for music.

The food was just so mediocre! It was mostly generic Tex-Mex fare. Exactly the Mexican food you deserve while you're listening to redneck jazz. Burrito was bland, mostly just over cooked scrambled eggs wrapped in a gummy tortilla and drenched in watery hot sauce. Served with 3 nuggets of unseasoned potatoes. Pathetic. $16, in no universe justifiable. Coffee was dirt water. No one seemed happy with their food. It was just the lot of us, slowly shoveling tasteless, tepid, soft mounds into our mouths. Service was fine though, can't fault them for anything.

Great cocktail menu. Usually drop in for a red hound. Today was my first time having lunch. Great ambience. Got their grouper tacos which I was not a fan of. Staff was very pleasant. Tried their chicken sandwich - delicious. Definitely recommend. Great for groups also. My firm stops in for happy hour and takes full advantage of their pool table.

My husband and I were in search of a place to have our wedding and we decided to book our event with Superfine. The Event Planner, Tanya, was so attentive and informative and she really wanted to make sure we as couple had our input and most importantly she worked well with our budget.

On our wedding day, my husband and I were happy and satisfied with the service. All of our guests had much great things to say about our event: they loved the food, the cake, the atmosphere and how attentive the servers were.

Cool location right under the Manhattan bridge in Dumbo, Brooklyn.  Building had that old-New York, industrial brick character inside and out.  Fun vibe inside.
We went for lunch this damp June saturday, and had reservations, but probably didn't need them.
I love the menu concept -- apparently selections change depending on ingredient availability and sustainability. Thumbs up for that.
Food was good, but I know there's more potential.  My grilled cheese was nice, with spinach and tomato on multi-grain bread, but a little too oily (yes i know it's grilled cheese, but still.)
My wife's portabello sandwich was also a bit on the greasy side.
Service was great.  I'd like to try this place again for dinner or later for drinks.
