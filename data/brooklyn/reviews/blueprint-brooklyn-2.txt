Blueprint serves delicious cocktails and has outdoor seating in the front (on the street and sidewalk) and back (in the courtyard). Tables were well spaced out. We went on a Thursday at 6pm and had no trouble getting a table for four. I had the "Never Never", a refreshing summery cocktail of Neversink Gin, Yellow Chartreuse, dry vermouth, pineapple, lime, honey, and tonic. My partner had the "My Dear Julius," which was Bourbon, damson plum liqueur, lemon, cinnamon, maple, whiskey barrel aged bitters, orange bitters, egg white. They require that you order food, which we didn't know about beforehand. We got the burrata bruschetta - I liked the burrata but the tomato could have been better. Overall, I would definitely come back here for drinks again!

Blueprint has outdoor seating in the front as well as in the backyard area right now! The front was all taken, so we took the back which was much nicer imo!
They seem to be more known for their cocktails, as a lot of their food reviews were just okk. But we enjoyed everything we ordered!

I loved the Parks and Leisure cocktail (vodka, aperol, grapefruit). Super refreshing and a pretty orange/pink color! My bf really liked his old fashioned too.

We also ordered the chicken liver mousse pate, which was reallly good and I'd definitely order again!! Loved the onion on top, and you MUST dip in the flaky sea salt

The brussels sprouts and bacon pizza was just ok though. The pizza bread is more of like a cracker bread and def did not like. BUT the toppings were great! Roasted brussels, small bits of bacon, and cheese. I would've liked the dish on its own (not as a pizza) OR as with a different bread/crust.

We were very enjoyed the place and the food and the cocktails. The cocktails was really good and it was hypnotizing to observe how bartender dancing with all his tools :)
Great place to visit.

With dim lighting, tapas to share, and bomb cocktails, Blueprint is perfect for date night. The moment we entered, all we saw were couples, so beware if you are thinking of coming here with friends. They also have a cute patio in the back that can be used during the summers - check it out if you come here!

The food wasn't mind-blowing, but the drinks were delicious. We got the bourbon based My Dear Julius and gin based Satan's Bell. My Dear Julius has egg white in it and therefore is a tad heavier. I expected Satan's Bell to be your classic gin and passion fruit juice flavored cocktail, but was pleasantly surprised by the red bell pepper juice that unfettered the drink! Satan's Bell was light, sweet and presented well. Kudos to the bartender, who invented it.

The food. We came here for dinner, which was supposed to be the main event, but left enjoying the cocktails more. The baby octopus with potatoes was okay but had more potatoes than octopus and wasn't anything to write home about. The roasted Brussel sprouts were a bit disappointing as they completely lacked salt. We dipped the sprouts in the lemon juice of the octopus dish to give them a bit of a kick. As the final dish, we got the Blueprint duck club, which definitely was the largest plate of all. The club sandwich had thinly sliced tasty duck meat. It was the first time I had duck as deli meat. Definitely not your typical date food though. Your hands are a bit of a mess after holding a club sandwich that looks like could belong to a diner.

Dropped by here on a very chilly November evening and was pleased to step inside and see a warm setting with lots of people around.
First the space: is very nice and certainly cozy/intimate but is well suited for small group or pairs. There is lots of bar seating and there is a full menu at the bar.

Next is the menu - there is a lot going on and a good selection of (New York) reasonably priced cocktails from the house list. There is also a reasonable selection wine and a handful of beers to choose from. However, the real reason we were there was for the pate or the whipped chicken liver dish. My partner had his heart set on that. So in addition to several excellent cocktails, we ordered two of those and the hummus which was also tasty.

Sitting at the bar by the door, we did not feel cold or jostled which was pleasant. The bar tender was attentive and things were taken care of quickly for us.

Overall, a great spot worth coming back to.

I've been writing this review for months... lol. I kept bypassing it but last night I stopped in for a drink and dessert and just had to share why I like this spot.

Setting: after 7pm the mood to me says date night. The lighting is dim and the tables are set for intimate conversation or you can sit at the bar and flirt with the bartenders...lol.

Drinks: the drink the night was called the Doctor is in...if you like a gin cocktail w/ a lil rum and a pretty flower this is the drink for you! My companion had wine, and enjoyed their pinot grigio.

Dessert: the bread pudding...OMG! It's my favorite dessert and I like to try it at any new spot I go to. I'm floored there's a spot this close to me with bread pudding that's so good.

Final thoughts: I'll be there tomorrow

Okay guys, I just found my new favorite summer spot. Blueprint, of course, has an indoor bar and some tables but the outdoor space is SO, so charming. If you want to impress your date (or yourself, or your friends, or even a stranger tbh), take them here.

We walked in on a Friday night without reservations so I figured the back space would be off limits but the sweet hostess was able to squeeze us into a nice little corner spot. For those of you who breezed over that sentence, let's note that the hostess was not only polite, but exceptionally sweet. A rarity in NYC.

We took our seats and promptly ordered some vino with our waitress who, AGAIN, was another darling. Too good to be true? Nope. Real life. Exceptional service from start to finish.

We also kept a menu to order some bites later on and I'm happy we did. The baby octopus was delicious, served with what I could only guess is tomatillo sauce, and potatoes. Definitely a good little plate to split. We also split the fish plate with cured salmon, another good choice for a light bite.

I'm so happy I found Blueprint. I'll definitely be back!

The cocktails deserve 4 stars but the food and service are definitely 1. I don't know if it's just because they are operating during an uncertain time of they just have a bad staff. All the food tasted like it was sitting in the fridge for 5 days and everything was less than mediocre. The waitress didn't ask us ONCE how everything was. The food runner did more than she did. I would only go back for drinks in the future. I guess that's what you get for eating at a cocktail bar.

Oh Blueprint, you will always hold a special place in my heart. It was here that I first met my fiancé and had some of the best cocktails I've ever tried. Nestled in the first neighborhood I lived in when I moved to the city, it's quite the find for ParkSlope.

In an area pretty crowded with sports bars not far from the Barclays Center, it offers a welcomed change of pace. Blueprint's classic and old-school charm carries far and wide in all of their drinks, food and service and I'm so so happy I found you. Or should I say found me. It is the perfect date spot. So for my 100th review I will write about you.

Oh where to begin, I suppose a good place would be the cocktails. They have a great selection of specialty drinks that range from a delicious grapefruit drink to a classic manhattan. We usually like to start the night off with happy hour which is pretty great with decent priced wine, beer and cocktails. They even offer little tasty bites. My fiancé will get the chicken liver mouse and I will get the hummus. His and hers and oh so delicious! We usually go for the baby octopus as well!

Now theres so many different ways to go about the food selections. We've tried almost everything and keep coming back for more! The pork sliders speak right to my southern soul and the rabbit pot pie is right up my fiancées alley. Or you do a classic meat and cheese platter with large selection of artisan cheeses and delicatessen meats. They even offer desserts. We tried the bread pudding the last time we were in and can I say it was love at first bite?

I don't really have a bad thing to say about this place. Go here. Drink up and fill your bellies with the best this neighborhood has to offer. Take it from me you won't regret it!

What a great late night Brooklyn bar! We stopped by on the way home after a late dinner in Manhattan to grab some drinks. There weren't any seats left in the main entry room but we were led to the back to some booths near the bathrooms where it was slightly quieter.

The cocktail and alcohol menu is quite extensive. I was able to choose two gin cocktails and enjoyed them thoroughly. The Beauregarde was tasty and sweet while the Last Word was less sweet but not any less delicious. Both cocktails were between $13-14 which I find quite reasonable in NYC (well, Brooklyn).

I've heard the rabbit pot pie is excellent, too - will try next time!

This spot is pretty cool. It is advertised as a tapas spot which is indeed true because even the "big plates" are a smaller portion. We ordered the FID & RICOTTA BRUSCHETTA: a house made ricotta topped with mission figs, oregano & honey sherry vinegar and the NIMAN RANCH PORK BUTT SLIDERS: pork on house made buns, served with red cabbage slaw, spicy pickles. I quickly realized that i did not like figs so that dish did not enthuse me too much but if you do I am sure you will love it. The pork sliders were really tasty I can always appreciate a good pork slider. The drinks were great and although it was packed the waitress was quite attentive. This is definitely a happening spot to grab a drink and some tapas in Park Slope!

Blueprint is the kind of small, cozy and neighborhoody spots that have solid cocktails and does not have a pretentious vibe.

The set-up inside... Blueprint is a long and narrow establishment, meaning, there's adiquate seating, but not a ton; both bar seating and (smaller) tables. Just the way I like it.

Oh, oh - and I got this cocktail... ready for it? With red pepper flavor. It's definitely different, and it's definitely good. I can assure you, it was tasty - not sweet and well worth giving it a shot. I got two.

The bartenders know their stuff, are friendly and will definitely address and explain and questions you have.

Here's the part you've been waiting for... yep, they have a super cute and cozy outdoor space that you'll want to check out as soon as possible. Oddly enough, the drinks go down a little smoother and quicker out back.

This is definitely my new favorite cocktail bar in the neighborhood, and honestly in Brooklyn.

Listen, I love cocktails, but these cocktails are insanely good. We've tried 4 and they were all ridiculously high quality with special ingredients and history!
I like anything sour and citrusy, but everything was good. They had one with watermelon and mint thats a summer special that was amazing. Also the cinnamon, orange cardamon one is delicious and the berry rosemary one was probably my favorite

We came here pretty late. 12:30 am on a Friday... (thus can't remember the names of the drinks)and the place was not empty! Blueprint is open till 4 am and the kitchen closes very late too. We were still ordering food at 2 am!

The food is amazing as well. We got the baby octopus and the Brussel sprout bacon pizza and it was delicious. The pizza is made of naan bread which makes it so doughy and good. The baby octopus comes with roasted potatoes and this jalapeño onion fresh salsa.
For dessert we got the bread pudding that was amazing!

Definitely coming back next time for happy hour to enjoy their amazing deals

Staff is super helpful and nice!

I love blueprint seriously 6 out of 5

Good cocktails, unpretentious crowd, great space, good food.

Blueprint was the 2nd stop in our night, and we were at that hanger stage for something to munch on (preferably fries!). Blueprint has lots of good reviews and their food looked pretty good, so we figured why not.

We came in at around midnight and it was about 2/3rd busy. We found space easily and were attended to in a quick manner the whole night. For drink, I got the Never Never (a gin drink with yellow chartreuse, rosemary, and a few other things I can't recall at the moment) which ended up being incredible and just the type of herbal I like. For food, we got the chicken liver pâté and the rabbit pot pie, which sounded comforting and delicious.

The chicken liver pâté was on point and the caramelised onions atop were simply divine. Beware though, that you should not skimp on the pâté, as there is more than there looks to be in that small ramekin. While this was not fries, it was so good that I felt compelled to close my eyes at random intervals of eating to truly appreciate the flavour.

The rabbit pot pie was underwhelming to be honest - the puffed layered pastry on top was hard and broke off in chunks. We were also expecting a crust of some sort to which there wasn't. The rabbit meat was sparse, but there was an abundance of nontraditional pot pie veggies - mushrooms, snap peas, etc. It honestly tasted more like my Chinese mom's stir fry than a traditional pot pie. It was unexpected, but not in a good way.

We are definitely coming back, but probably staying away from main courses and sticking to the drinks and pâté.

Very cozy ambiance, especially on a cold night. Came here to cap off a dinner nearby and this place was so warm and lovely. Ordered the satan's bell and the minotauro and they were both great cocktails. Would've never thought to have a red bell pepper in a cocktail but it provided an interesting kick to the drink that I loved. The minotauro is essentially an alcoholic chai drink that was also delicious! Would definitely come back again.

I go to this bar regularly. The food, drinks, and service are consistently good. I get the boquerones every time, they are such a perfect drinking food. Tha rabbit pot pie is also great. Very homey vibe with an intimate, sophisticated twist.

I was meeting a friend for dinner and drinks and she suggested Blueprint. She is unfamiliar with Park Slope, but wanted to come hang out, and it's near my job. Unfortunately, we picked to go during prime time. I got there just as the last table was taken, so my name went on the waiting list. My friend was running late, which was fine because Blueprint was quite busy. Busy means good usually. In this case, both good food and good service.

When I first walked in the door, the host came over to explain that they were fully booked, it was going to be a wait, and almost immediately asked me if I would like to see the menu. Periodically, he would check in, give me a status update in terms of a table, and would see if I wanted to order a drink. He was so top of the door, new patron walked in the door? He was there in seconds, explaining there was a wait, handing out the menu, and telling people how many people were in front of them. He had his stuff down! It was a long wait, but it was very organized.

Just as I was being seated, my friend walked in the door, and the bartender came by to let us know happy hour was ending soon. My friend got the kickstarter, which tasted like a cold espresso. Delicious. I got a Smokey Mary's. It is my idea of the perfect cocktail. I love tequila. I love spicey. I love everything about this drink. My friend also got the minotauro, which she loved. For dinner, we got the burrata and she did the rabbit pot pie, and  I did the squash and fig salad. The only thing I would have done different is, instead of the burrata already on the bread and I kind of love that moment when you cut into it. I would have preferred the burrata and with the bread not assembled. Personal preference, but the flavors were excellent.

Will be going back here. But next time, will probably be making a reservation first.

We recently moved  back to Brooklyn. I had forgotten the perks of doing laundry in a neighborhood unlike our previous location. Chuck excitedly looked at me after putting the wash in and stated that he would like a cocktail and that it was currently happy hour at blueprint. We walked over and got two seats at the bar. Our bartender gave us the menus and mentioned that we had about 10 min before happy hour ended. We quickly decided on a cocktail and sat back while he created some beauties.

I have been here a few times in the past. It can get very busy but on a Monday, it was nice, dark and subdued. It felt like the perfect place to spend a chilly fall night. On this particular visit, we only grabbed the two drinks ($9 each). I've previously had the hummus platter and one of their pizzas. Both were definitely something I would be happy to reorder in the future. The food menu is fairly unique, many with twists on more traditional bar food. I'm thrilled to be living so close so I can try more soon.

Hung out in Blueprint while waiting for a dinner reservation in the neighborhood. Very very cute antique-feel cocktail bar. Drinks were quality and staff was friendly. I didn't have any of the bites but I would definitely go back to sample the menu - there were even a good amount of vegan options.

Loved the vibe, I am glad I stumbled upon this place!

I've only been here once (I seldom leave my nest of Manhattan) to meet friends for drinks but I felt I should leave a good review as the atmosphere was trendy, laidback but also probably flexible for various occasions.

First: Dim.
Second: Creative menu, good cocktails
Third: A lively vibe with various seating arrangements
Lastly: SUPER LOUD. So bring your loudspeaker please.

A bit small for my opinion but the bar had a good amount of seating.

I would say it was the Brooklyn and smaller version of Penrose in Manhattan.
Wouldn't go out of my way for this place but for the locals, it's a fun spot

Great cocktails. So warm and cozy in this tiny bar. It is kind of this railroad style bar, long and narrow. Delicious cocktails and bartenders who are creative. Cute date spot and a great place to share some cheese and meats and apps. The cocktails are all amazing, you cannot go wrong. We tried four different cocktails, but hard to even recommend one because it is all based on your preference- you can't make a mistake here!

Almost hidden amongst the plethora of hip restaurants and bars on 5th Ave, Blueprint is most definitely a place you shouldn't overlook! Upon entering you're immediately struck with the ambient atmosphere, giving it almost a speakeasy sort of vibe.

A friend and I came on a Thursday night for a celebratory "It's Almost the End of the Week" cocktail. Our bartender was incredibly friendly and suggested a few drinks that he thought we'd like upon hearing our preferences. I ordered the Minotauro while my friend went for The Doctor. Hands down, my drink won!

Both were amazing of course, but I have to say the Minotauro tastes basically like a chai latte (one of my absolute favorite drinks) and it goes down smoother than any other cocktail I've ever had! The best part is that it's quite high in alcohol content too as I had a nice buzz going on from one drink. If you're headed to Blueprint and you're a chai latte lover, you know what to try!

Ultimately my experience here was positive. I'm a bit of a walk away otherwise I'd absolutely be a regular. Pretty jealous of those who live in the vicinity!

Great cocktail place. Big fan of the décor, which is classy, cozy, and intimate.  And a bigger fan of the cocktails. Sure, the server will forget your order and will come back to ask a second time to ask what you ordered EVERY SINGLE TIME. And sure it's loud and packed and people will unapologetically encroach upon your space. And yes, you may end up in the company of someone that you find somewhat annoying who may or may not be spitting on you. Oh wait just me? Okie.

But those cocktails. So delicious. And being conveniently located in Park Slope is a plus. Mixology-quality cocktails at Brooklyn prices. I enjoyed the Kentucky Tanlines, My Dear Julius, and Old Fashioned. PS - You don't actually need to drink three cocktails. Two will definitely suffice unless you're actively trying to make the company better by drinking more. Just me again? Whoops.

The food menu looks pretty awesome too, and would definitely come back for dinner.

This place was absolutely awesome. My cousin was staying in Park Slope for work and after a long back and forth about who would come to who (I live in Manhattan) I relented and agreed to go to her hood. I found Blueprint through Yelp and it looked promising and it definitely delivered.

We were able to be seated immediately and a waitress came over and gave us cocktail and food menus. If I had one complaint about my experience, it would be that the service was a little odd - it was unclear at first whether there was table service or not, and the server (granted, she was alone) wasn't very communicative. It definitely took a while for her to come take our order, although once she did everything came out relatively quickly.

We both ordered cocktails - mine (My Dear Julius - $12) had bourbon, Damson plum gin liqueur, lemon, cinnamon, maple, whiskey barrel aged bitters, orange bitters, and egg white. My cousin's (The Doctor Is In - $12) had Dorothy Parker Gin, Rhum J.M., absinthe, maraschino liqueur, lemon, and house-made grenadine. I preferred mine, although both were absolutely delicious and wonderfully crafted. I find that it's really hard to do egg-white drinks well, but mine was perfect. Both were also beautiful, which I always appreciate. Clearly a well-trained bar staff.

We also ordered dessert - there were only three choices, but all of them sounded good. We decided on the cherry bread pudding because it sounded interesting ($8) and it was honestly one of the best things I've ever had before in my life. It was truly incredible and absolutely melt-in-your-mouth. We also got the pickles (weird combo, I know) which were $5 and slightly overpriced but were house-made. My cousin thought they were too spicy although she was just being a little byotch - they were great.

Overall, everything was incredibly well-done, and although I can't imagine myself rushing back to Park Slope (sorry, BK), if I ever found myself in or near that area I would definitely come back again.

Cool patio, free WiFi, clean bathrooms. Takes cards.

I came to Blueprint on a Sunday afternoon with a few friends for drinks. It was pretty busy, and the only space available was at the bar, but that was fine. We were immediately given two coasters, and on one of them was placed a glass of water - very good start. The drinks are varied and interesting and reasonably priced. If you're not busy chatting with friends or looking at your cellphone, watch the bartenders in action. They must live on caffeine, they never stop moving. One of them is quite adept at mixing and shaking two drinks at a time. Someone needs to take and post a video of him doing that.

Love this cocktail lounge. I've been here a few times, I'm not normally a specialty cocktail guy, but I did love 'The Smokey Mary's ,I also  had some boquerones and cheese plate at the bar, I loved it because it was that weird time on a Sunday in the slope where brunch is over ( not sad about that) and dinner time is an hour plus away, also factored into this equation was that it was after a Nets game and you can maybe follow me back around to the understanding of my choice and enjoyment of this establishment. I needed a stiff drink and not some 'elevated' bar food** to eat to prevent Hanger.... As mentioned, I have been here a handful of times for a drink, and always enjoyed it. Service was spot on and friendly.  This is a great date place,catching up with somebody or for pre-dinner cocktails.

** like Peter D does,  en homage I'm using the ** because of my bougie statement. If you aren't PDelish, *** Deal with it, this is Yelp!
*** yes , that's my nickname for Pete.

I love this place! It's great for a date and it's romantic. It has outdoor seating and a sleek wood inside. I appreciate their collection of cocktails and samples multiple.

It's very busy and loud over the weekend but it's still worth a visit if you can squeeze at bar.

I keep forgetting they have food so I can't comment on that.

My friend and I were in the area and he told me that we should go here for happy hour. I'm glad to say I did because they do not skimp on happy hour at all lol. We both got a dark and stormy and there was an adequate amount of rum in it and not overflowing with ice which is pretty standard for happy hour drinks unfortunately. Would definitely come back if I happen to be in the area.

This place is a great cocktail spot. It's unfortunate that it's okay for their staff to undermine women....

I took my team to blueprint after a corporate event. A male employee of mine tried to personally pay for a round of drinks and I interjected with the company card. The (I believe) Aussie male bartender thought I was a friend/date when I tried to pay for the bill and refused my card. I tried to explain the situation... He turned to the guy and asked him if he was ok with me paying! I had to argue with him for a good 3 minutes before he accepted my card. Once he finally agreed to re-run the cards, rather than apologize for the confusion, he had the audacity to ask why I had an attitude and  turned to my employee and said "good luck"! (Still assuming I was a date I presume).

He later stated that he was offended when I called out his actions as sexist....Maybe I'm mistaken, but I have not witnessed any man facing these same obstacles when trying to pick up the tab for his team (or even on while trying to pay for a date) #no #equalpayequaltreatment #idontwanttobepaidfor #ijustwantrespect #RBG

If you're looking for an quiet and intimate spot at this bar, I recommend sitting towards the back by the restrooms. I'm sure sitting in the back patio will be very nice too when the weather gets warmer. I tried the "Ranga Tang" which had a very interesting taste. It was a craft cocktail made with a single-malt whiskey, ginger and bitters. It was very different from the rest of the menu. I also tried the "My Dear Julius" which was made with bourbon, plum gin liqueur, maple, lemon, cinnamon, orange bitters, egg white. It was such a photogenic drink!!

We decided to also stay here for dinner, since we saw some good food on the menu and did not want to travel so much. We ordered the baby octopus, the chef's choice of charcuterie and we ordered a tomato & cress pizza. All the food was excellent and the service was great. Our waitress kept checking up on us to make sure we were having a great time! I would recommend to try this place if you like craft cocktails! :)

A really great place for a drink and some food.  Came here twice now.  The first time was solely for drinks which were delicious.  We tried one each and were pleasantly surprised by them.

The second time, we came for food and drinks.  This time we got the chicken liver mousse and the cheese/meat board.  Both were delicious!  There was a good amount of food on both that we were both satiated at the end.  The drinks we ordered this time was different than the last time and they were still good.  Great place for a chill night out.

This place is amazing. It's small and kind of hidden, but once you find it, you're in for a treat. They have an incredible happy hour menu. There's also a really cute outdoor area.

Of all their signature drinks, they choose a couple which are $7. The rest are $2 off. Same for the snacks, a couple are specials and the rest are a dollar off.

I had the Smokey marg and it was delicious, similar to the other yelp reviewers. It's an artisanal drink at a beer bottle budget.

I also had the charcuterie plate which was also reasonably priced. $16 for 3 choices. The only thing is the plate could have used a little mustard but the meat and cheese was so good.

Beyond that, the service was amazing. Our waitress was so helpful in choosing what to order and very timely and attentive. Hi

Great drinks. Speakeasy level. Smooth operator was the winner in my book. Also the smoky mezcal cocktail (forgot the name) was really good. The service is above average.

One of my favorite cocktail bars in Brooklyn alongside fresh kills on grand street. We grabbed some seats at the bar and ordered some cocktails. I believe the drink I ordered was called el dorado. I'm not 100% certain on the name but it was a cocktail made with mezcal. Great drink and the showmanship from the bartenders was very cool. Despite being extremely busy, they service was super quick and attentive. Great staff! For the second round, I had some mezcal neat. The mezcal selection was limited, but I'm glad that had some in stock. The environment is laid back but most people are dressed business casual.
