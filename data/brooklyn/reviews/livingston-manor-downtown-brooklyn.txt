The sandwiches from Molto Stretto were absolutely amazing!  I could go every day & try something different!  The calabrian chili spread gave my sandwich this delicious slow heat.  Such a great find! I'm definitely going back!

This place was fucking amazing! Sandwiches are literally the best thing on earth! Drinks are delicious and the hospitality is honestly great! I loved the baristas and their friendly personalities. Definitely will be coming more often, you need to try the pesto turkey sandwich!!

Such a cool neighborhood bar! Friendly, talented bartenders, cool crowd with lots of regulars, great music, fab drinks. Wish this were in my hometown- I'd be here all the time. Worth checking out if you are in the area.

This is a great neighborhood bar that's often pretty busy during happy hour.

They've got a little outdoor area in front, with a cozy and spacious bar on the inside. It expands all the way to the back which has more private little tables.

Drinks are decently priced and their bar is well stocked. They've also got some bites on their menu if you need a light meal or a snack.

Check this place out if you're around!

Was exploring Brooklyn with a friend and they recommended this place from a resent visit during the holiday pop up. It was a Sunday night, so very chill. We sat at a table, no menus on the table and no acknowledgement or instruction from the staff (hence the stars). Luckily, seats opened at the bar and we moved. Once there the girl bartender was friendly and pleasant and the drinks we ordered were SUPER delicious (cranberry club and non alcoholic spiced hot chocolate). I'd go again, but as a customer definitely felt a bit unimportant initially.

We were visiting Brooklyn from California and we were testing out a bunch of bars.  But this one was a real good find! The Bartender was awesome, very friendly and he had made a drink of the night.

"Hearing aid" couldn't tell you what was in it, but it was delicious and had so many fancy mixing and things to it. Burned a cinnamon stick which I really
Liked!
Also I ordered a pina colada which was super yummy! Not too sweet at all.

How did I get so lucky to have a bar like Livingston Manor so close to my apartment?! It has proven to be a solid bar choice with every single half a dozen times that I've been here. Bartenders are super friendly and quick with the cocktails, which are always strong and leave me without complaints. The beer selection is plentiful and offers a decent variety.

Sure, the bathrooms are a tad on the gross side and the smokers completely take over the small outdoor space, but neither of those things is enough to keep me away. I would describe the overall ambiance as fancy divey - dark, fairly large, yet somehow still cozy. I am all about their skylight - unique feature for a bar of this caliber.

More times than not, I stay out way too late when I hit the Manor, but it's hard not to with their great music that always keeps me humming along and makes me forget that they stay open until 4am most nights. I still have not gotten around to trying any of the food, but I'm sure that is just around the corner in the near future.

Joe and Lindsey are fantastic bartenders!

We went late late late for a nightcap a couple weeks ago, just three of us ladies. We grabbed a beer and chilled for a while. Really nice atmosphere, and a gem in Downtown Brooklyn.

While we were there, a man started hitting on my friend. It was unwanted and aggressive. (I won't go into detail). In seconds, both Joe and Lindsey were swatting the man away, and the bouncers were dragging him out the door. SEE YA.

Then we continued our egregious amounts of drinking, took some shots with our two heroes and headed home around 3am.

A delightful evening.

5 Stars for a cocktail bar that would be on my regular, multiple-times-a-week rotation if I lived nearby.

Walking in, I heard Mac Miller playing in the background and a great crowd enjoying what appeared to be finely crafted cocktails (not a margarita mix in sight) and I knew Yelp had led us in the right direction once again.

The bartender, a casually dressed dude with a beard,  greeted us at the bar and asked what we had in mind. They had a nice little cocktail menu, but I was unsure and let him know I was leaning towards something whiskey-based, that wasn't sweet, and wasn't your typical old fashioned. He quickly suggested something he'd been making which was similar to an old fashioned but with a sick kick from ancho chili syrup.

This drink, along with a tequila and sherry drink my companion ordered, was right on the mark. It wasn't too sweet (which for me, is a low barrier), and the bite hit you at the end in a subtle fashion towards the back of the throat. My friend's drink left a taste of sherry in your mouth that was delightful and helped me forget about the tequila (bad past with tequila).

Beyond that, the ambiance and music went from great, to epic. With Mystical playing as we were leaving, making me reminisce HARD about those nights out at the club in college. Ahhh, the early 2000s... May we never forget...

The highlight of the bar though was the bartender. I didn't catch his name, but this dude would have me coming back night after night. And the tunes.

Stopped into Livingston Manor for happy hour on Friday. Decent food, decent drinks, decent prices, but nothing that left me with the urge to head back.

Quality: Livingston Manor is a pretty standard bar. Falling somewhere between cocktail and dive, it serves up drinks and a limited food menu. I went with a few beers from the happy hour selection. Nothing crazy, but a few local options and okay variety. I also shared a Meat & Cheese Board. They leave the compilation of your three selections up to you. We went one cured meat, one soft cheese, and one hard cheese. The options constantly change, which adds some variety. What came on our board was good, though I think they could have made it look a bit prettier.
Quantity: A fair sized Meat & Cheese Board and solid beer pours.
Value: $26 for a Meat & Cheese Board. $2 off Draft Beers during happy hour, leaving most options between $4 and $6.
Ambiance: Livingston Manor is found along an alley in Downtown Brooklyn. They have a tiny patio outside, which was occupied by smokers our entire visit, and then a decent sized indoor area. The bar sits on the left wall, while high tops spread around the front space. The back area of the bar is a bit more cozy and private. A mix of brick, concrete, and wood, industrial accents, and a classic rock playlist should all be expected. Unfortunately, nothing that really stands out.
Crowd: A good sized crowd for happy hour. Always a few seats available, but busy enough and a fun group.
Service: Quick and helpful service. Appreciated the bartender who went out of his way to get us drinks even after we moved to a table.
Parking: No easy parking in the area.

I was so focused with catching up with a college friend who I haven't seen in years & forgot to take any pics. I'll just say this about the bar. It's near Barclays & Alamo movie theatre. I came here during their happy hour & it was lovely. Service was great & the waiters made you feel special like it was your birthday if you know what I mean haha. For those who didn't get that reference, it means that the drinks were tasty & strong. It felt like a hidden gem because it wasn't flashy at all, just a dive in bar that you would expect in some dark alley with a few tables & a bar table. No TVs in sight whatsoever which was a refreshing touch because you don't see much of those anymore especially since millennials are all for visual experiences. Bottom line is I enjoyed myself & I will come back for sure

The drinks are generally good.  I appreciate a well made cocktail, I wish they had more food options.  They have a great bourbon hot toddy in the winter.  My big complaint is that they once charged my credit card twice for the same transaction.  The bar tender didn't even apologize.  Don't play with my money.

My friends and I found this gem while figuring out what to do on an unseasonably warm fall night. We came across this place and fell in love right way. It is dimly lit, and tastefully decorated. My friends really enjoyed their drinks, and we shared an amazing cheese & meat plate. There bar menu was small but filled with some really great selections. This place was really enjoyable and I highly recommend it.

Great place to hang out with co workers or bring a date to. This place is a very cozy casual spot to hang and grab a drink. I personally never got food from here so I can't speak for the food. Wolf the bartender is the man and always on top of his game.

This is a very cool bar.
They have great appetizers, cocktails, draught beers and wines.  This is a nice size with plenty of seating and even a little outdoor space.  Bartenders and servers are always very cool and attentive.
Good place to meet with friends.  Can get pretty crowded in the evenings.

I just keep coming back here.
Appetizers are delicious and I've been ordering their specialty cocktails instead of classic cocktails (i.e. Old fashioned) and they're really delicious! Really interesting and well balanced and strong-I suggest you order off their menu and get a favored classic.
This place is so chill.

Ok had to update review.
Usually I reserve 5 stars for "fancy" places  that wait hand and foot but this place is awesome.
Classy meets chill here.
Bartenders are friendly, low key and attentive.
Cocktails are a little weaker than I like but they have tons of top shelf whiskeys and the happy hour (2 pints for ten or something like that) is awesome.
Had some cheese and "small bites" here and everything was delicious-so much attention to detail.
All in all, fantastic experience and a real treasure. I look forward to becoming a regular.

Came here on a Friday night to meet up with some coworkers and had a horrible experience. Don't come here hungry as their food menu is skimp with just meat and cheese platters. No options for people with dietary restrictions. Not even French fries!

The waitress who was working our table was extremely rude and condescending after screwing up our requests. It was horrible. First she "didn't hear me" order a garden salad. Then it took forever to arrive at our table. THEN my glass of wine had a miscellaneous substance in it and she seemed annoyed with us for reporting it to her. She brought back a new glass with the only attitude. It was also very clear from where I was sitting that she was talking crap about me to her colleague at the bar. I'm not sure if she was treating me this way because I'm a person of color or if she was just ticked off that night. Either way I won't be returning here again.

This was a great spot for happy hour! So many of their beers and wines were discounted which made it a great deal. It was perfect for a friend and I hanging out, but is also great for groups. There is a cute outdoor space which makes it perfect for the spring and summer months when it is nice out. Because this place is in Brooklyn, it has much more space than similar bars in Manhattan
Would definitely go back and try some cocktails but stuck to happy hour deals this time!

I prefer the vibe here on the weekends. Great place to start or end your night. Joe is pouring and controlling the music. No complaints about either, ever. I've only gotten here in time for the only late night food option, the grilled cheese, and it's yummy. Tomato, bacon and mixed cheeses pressed on quality bread with a bag of Cape Cod chips for $9. It's a nicely kept spot also. Come through!

There happens to be a staggering number of figures in early American history named Robert Livingston, all of whom are bound by knots in the blood. The town for which this bar is named, as well as the street just beyond, are both named for Roberts Livingston, who were cousins and contemporaries, yet not the same person. One ruled over an anachronistically feudal estate in the Catskills; the other was the master mason who swore in George Washington as the first president, a singular act marking the beginning of centuries of uniquely American paranoia.

The Livingston bloodline tangles into those represented by many other New York streets: Bleecker, Cortlandt, Clinton, Van Ness, and so on and so forth, concrete threads of conspiracy. Outlandish legends readily spread of a population of escaped crocodiles making their home beneath them, as well as of lizard-like beings secretly controlling American politics while wearing human skin. Such stories seem absurd until we remember that the reptilian cortex underlies all of our higher brain functions; that every supposedly rational belief of man is built atop the thrashings of a terrified, skull-shelled tortoise.

That being said, the Illuminati are real. You can often find them on commuter planes between LaGuardia and Logan, as well as throughout the Under East Side, holed up in bars run by the troglodytes of antiquity. These establishments are torchlit and densely-packed, accommodations intended to compensate for their ectothermal nature. There they decide on the taxes in blood that each earthly nation shall pay while devouring handfuls of tempura-battered cigarettes like popcorn.

Fortunately, this is not an Illuminati bar. There are no exchanges of mermaid fingernails for drinks, no ice blocks congealed from the tears of endangered species. This is a place for the warm-blooded.

Weaving spiders come not here.

This spot is a breath of fresh air in a part of town that isn't really know for good bars. We were meeting some friends before a movie at Alamo, and needed a place to unwind before we went in. We could have, of course, gone to house of wax (which is an OK bar in its own right, and is located inside Alamo), but wanted something different that night. They suggested Livingston and we agreed. Happy we did, as we found a new spot that we will be sure to return to.

Walking up, its hard to miss how dramatically the neighborhood is changing. Huge new residential buildings are really taking over, and its starting to feel a lot more like downtown Manhattan than ever before. Leaving aside if this is a good thing or not, it really is interesting to see how Livingston fits in. The space doesn't feel new (like its neighbors), but it also doesn't feel out of place. Its cool that a place like this can fit in so well in a space that is so fluid. The bar dominates the interior (as you might expect...at a bar), but there are plenty of tables and booths to be had (not a bad choice for a larger group). The staff was friendly enough, and their HH beer prices are not bad at all for what might be considered a pricey neighborhood. I didn't try a cocktail, but the one's I saw being made looked pretty solid. The bar was pretty full on the Friday we went, but considering the options of the neighborhood, that wasn't really surprising. That said, if you're coming with more than four, I'd make an effort to get here early for one of the larger tables. If you're really lucky, you can grab one of the small tables outside (and if you sit long enough, a new building might spring up in front of you...)

All in all, this place is a solid call; I've no doubt this will be my new go to if I'm in the area.

I have found my new favorite bar! I would live in this place if I was a resident of downtown Brooklyn. We were bar hopping since we only had one night in the area, but loved this place and my drink so much that we came back for our night cap. When we returned there were 4 bar tenders instead of the three earlier.

The vibe coming from this place is fantastic. It seems inconspicuously tucked away, because it has a great little porch before the entrance. The front wall is a large door and huge windows with seating on both sides. When you enter you will see there are multiple options for seating with five high tables and a concrete bar that stretches the length of the space. In the back is more seating and another small outdoor space. The lighting is uniquely industrial. I drooled over the large circular antique mirrors that balance the wall behind the bar. They play a mix of music that I appreciated. The bar tenders were very friendly, had great smiles, and fast for creative cocktail place. They were good at multitasking as would make a drink and take your order at the same time.

They had an impressive cocktail, beer, wine and food list.  The prices are normal for a nice cocktail bar. I sipped on, well tried to sip on, the Corner stone. It was a red currant infused vodka with cognac, fresh lemon, cherry jam, topped with Prosecco. I am a sucker for a cocktail topped with Prosecco. My hubby enjoyed the local gin with tonic. Since we were only staying for one round and nibble we opted for the deviled eggs. They were scrumptious. We liked addition of frishee greens, pickled fennel (?) and green sauce. We saw another table get the veggie sandwich which we were eyeing on the menu and it looked delicious as well. The people  who got it didn't leave a crumb on their plate so I think I can assume they enjoyed it.

Good beers, good cocktails, a tiny backyard space, and a tiny frontyard sidewalk space. Big interior though. And cool bartenders and waitresses.

I've also run into multiple people that I've known from high school and college here. Small world, but I guess this is where lawyers and law school kids like to hang out.

This is a charming little spot in Downtown Brooklyn that's easy to miss (small 'Manor' sign that can get lost in the shuffle between avenues). I've only been a couple of times, but the staff has always been friendly, the music's never been too loud, and it's always had an overall great ambiance for a lowkey hang.

This was the first cocktail bar I went to when I moved to Brooklyn nearly two years ago, and it remains a favorite.  The cocktail menu changes seemingly as frequently as the beer list--always something new to try.  Last time, I went with one of my usual no-syrup/no-juice (i.e., all booze) selections and followed it up with a fun tiki-style drink.  Both great.  They also nail the classics every time I've requested one.

The charcuterie is reasonably priced and well-portioned for sharing a snack or for one person's dinner.  Atmosphere feels sophisticated without being stuffy or contrived.  Usually bustling without being overcrowded--can always find a seat or two at the bar.

Love it.

Good bar for after work/ end of day drinks! They have a big selection of different types of beers and also a good happy hour. We were able to reserve a table for the group but probably wouldn't have had to wait anyway (it was a Wednesday night).

Downtown Brooklyn has definitely changed. I lived in BK x over 20yrs.  Recently went to visit a friend living in the newly re-established buildings now converted into condos. He suggested to go for a drink nearby, I thought maybe head over to Court street area. Surprised I was to be on Livingston St.

I certainly knew I wasn't in Kansas anymore. Anyway, I won't turn this post into the gentrification of Fulton St.

We got there a bit around midnight (Thursday?). Not packed but there were several people still there getting their drank on.
Seats were available by the bar. Waitress was friendly enough.
Atmosphere is "dark". We stayed for 2 drinks each, chatted with some other friendly patrons.

It's still a distance from where I live but I would like to try the Happy Hr. Glad to see the space around there is drumming up some life to it.

In the depths of the downtown Brooklyn area it can be hard to find a good place to get a drink. Luckily Livingston Manor now exists.

Came here for happy hour and was pleasantly surprised. An excellent array of beers, cocktails, and wine. All at an excellent price. Playing some good tunes, sippin on some whiskey, and hanging out with my girl, I couldn't be happier.

Happy Hour does get a little crowded so make sure you come a little earlier to find your nook. I still would like to come by and check it out at night, I've heard great things. Maybe you should too.

I never post on Yelp but had to this time. Livingston hosted our welcome drinks the night before our wedding. They were really flexible in customizing the offerings for our group to meet our budget and vibe. It was a really fun, relaxing night and the service was amazing. Guests had a fun time and loved their drinks. Thanks for helping kick off our wedding weekend!

Good, solid bar. I just wandered in here the other day, and the staff was super welcoming and cheerful. I went during happy hour on a Thursday and there was a lot of available seating. I'd recommend sitting in the back because the bar is rather dark, but there's a huge skylight in the back.

Would go again!

I came in here last night after running a few errands...ducked in here to avoid the rain and so glad I did. Upon entering you notice the rustic and inviting feeling immediately. I sat at the bar and ordered a glass of wine, which was priced fairly for the quantity served. They have a wide selection of Beer on tap, which I will try next time. Their Menu offers suitable items for everyone and appetizing enough that you may be inclined to want to try different things. The bartender was super cool and courteous! Can't wait to go back!

The owners and talent behind Franklin Park and Crown Inn in Crown Heights are behind Livingston Manor, a new bar in downtown Brooklyn. Located between Hoyt (2,3) train station and Hoyt (A,C) train station Livingston Manor  brings a much needed watering hole to the area.

Being very familiar with both Franklin Park and Crown Inn I had high expectations for this bar, and opening night didn't disappoint.

The bar is beautiful and spacious. There is ample seating throughout and a cool skylight in the back.For people who smoke or like drinking outside, there is small area out back and a front porch where you can indulge.

The beer selection covers just about everything ( they have 12 taps) including several from Catskills brewery.

I spent my time enjoying the cocktails which are fantastic. The standout was The Bugsville Fizz, a $13 variation on ramos gin fizz, but with bourbon instead of gin. An egg white based cocktail, so delicious  it was hard to sip slow. The Dominicana, a $12 rum and coffee liqueur based cocktail is also excellent, Both were pleasantly sweet but not excessively so. If you prefer a spicier cocktail try the Blinking Light ($12) a mezcal based cocktail with chili salted rim.

With all that said what makes me return to a bar is the staff. Being  familiar with a few already and liking who I met last night, I can see this becoming yet another bar for me to hangout in regularly.

PS-  they do have food, but arrived too late to try any.

Very nice bar for an after-work drink. They have an interesting selection of beers on tap and a nice happy hour on those.
I prefer to go there in the colder moths for some reason--it's dark and cozy. In the Summer, they have a front patio available.
It is usually very loud (there are always big groups there!) and the bartenders can be a little rough over there... depends on a day!

A speakeasy-like bar in the middle of an underdeveloped Downtown Brooklyn street! So glad I discovered this spot.

It's sandwiched between some beat down buildings and maybe a grocery store, but once you step in, it's like you're in another world. I absolutely LOVE the smell in here...you know the cocktails will not disappoint.

They must change the cocktail menu quite frequently so unless you are willing to gamble, I recommend asking the bartender as the Yelp pics from a few months ago might be old news.

The jamon y queso sandwich is soooooo good and flavorful. I didn't really enjoy the meatballs, but highly recommend the sandwich.

This spot is a must try!
