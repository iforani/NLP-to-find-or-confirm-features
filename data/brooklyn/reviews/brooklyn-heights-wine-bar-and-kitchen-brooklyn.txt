Cute wine bar offering a comforting weekend brunch menu. I recently tried the Sticky Bun French Toast and Biscuits and Gravy. The French Toast was fantastic - soft, crispy, and sticky texture combined with Bananas Foster and maple flavors. Biscuits and Gravy was also tasty.

The restaurant recently started selling homemade brioche donuts. I am always on the hunt for a good donut and this one did not disappoint.

Overall, worthy neighborhood spot to enjoy brunch or a grab a glass of wine.

This is what I love about New York: small places that love what they do, and do it extremely well.

That describes The Brooklyn Heights Wine Bar & Kitchen to a "T".

Popped in during happy hour for a glass of wine and some nibbles.  Got a semi-dry Spanish white and probably the best rendering of baked brie that I've had in some time. Truly baked, with lingonberry jam, pistaccio nuts, and toast rounds. The cheese was actually hot enough that I had to let it cool, lest I burn my tongue.

My server, Hallie, introduced me to some other happy hour wines that were also impressive. The 45-seat place offers a 2003 Temperanillo Cabernet ... for $6 a glass!  How can you say no to a 16-year-old wine at that price? And no, it hadn't turned. It was round and smooth, and not TOO full. For $6? Pour me ANOTHER!

If you like wine and good, reasonably priced nibbles, try this place. Or don't. The rest of us will thank you for leaving us more room to enjoy this hidden gem.

Dan and I had ourselves a fun day out in Brooklyn and we came across this place walking back from the Botanical Gardens. We got a perfect quiet seat right by the window so we could people watch. We enjoyed a glass of wine with the BEST fig and ricotta crostini ever!! And to top it off the BBQ pulled pork chicken sandwich with crispy chips and side salad was just as great!

I come here out of pure necessity. The food is blah and if you just want a place to sit where no one will bother you - this restaurant or diner like establishment is a place to go. I cant even recall what I ordered - i believe the shishito peppers and chicken breast. It is a neighborhood spot but not an amazing menu to go gaga over

Super cool bar with a great selection of wine. This has a home bar type feel, where the service is what separates it from everything else.

The $10 beer and burger happy hour deal has got to be the best in the neighborhood.

Plus, they have a bunch of beer/wine/cocktail options at $6 (HH is M-Th 4:30 to 7).

Bartenders are super nice. Space is cozy but not cramped.

I come here often from Manhattan because the
food is simply superb!

You cannot go wrong with any of the starters -
my favorites are the shrimp and chorizo tapas and
the lamb meatballs - and the beet salad is the
best I've ever had! For dinner I love the braised
beef ribs or the green pork chili. When I'm not
in the mood for meat, I go for the shrimp scampi
or the lobster coulibiac. Don't skip dessert! The
chef makes great profiteroles as well as daily
specials like the key lime pie.

People in Brooklyn Heights are lucky to have a
neighborhood joint with such yummy food!

Loved this place! Small but cozy. Service was great considering the place was packed and there were only 2 servers. All the food was delicious. I have he frittata, others had the burger, croque monsieur, salmon avocado blt and their biscuits.

The prices were very reasonable and the quality of food was excellent. We were a large party and they served all our food at the same time, hot and delicious.

You will not be disappointed if you find yourself wanted to visit this establishment.

We hope to be back.

Really glad we stopped in here!They have a great selection of wines and a welcoming atmosphere. The service was warm, and the food was delicious. I ordered the chicken coq au vin, which was moist, flavorful, and came served in a delicious cabernet sauce. It came out quickly and was extremely hearty and satisfying. Andrew, the chef, Derek, and Nur were extremely personable and friendly, and We really enjoyed our visit. I WILL be back!

Stopped by as a tourist on a Monday afternoon for a glass of wine (or two) and loved it! The wait staff was very friendly and attentive. We got a seat at the bar right away and the rest of the restaurant wasn't too crowded. I had a delicious glass of Matthew Fritz Chardonnay - bright but smooth and not too buttery and healthy pours!! The menu items looked great - will be back to try the curry chicken salad sandwich or baked Brie!

Lunch for my wife was an outstanding beet salad and, for me, a very simple salad, just bibb lettuce and their homemade dressing consisting of olive oil and champagne vinegar plus we shared a baked brie appetizer .... everything was delicious !! Their wine list is huge with a number of very reasonable priced wines by the glass but they have only 2 beers tap. We will definitely return.

It was a germ that we random bumped into. We were planning to walk on the Brooklyn bridge on Saturday and it was really gloomy and cold that day, so we decided to go into this lovely bistro to warm up.

We ordered a duck oil fried fries and an espresso. The fries were delicious.

We love the atmosphere of the bistro, warm and cozy. Highly recommended:)

It's been a long time that I was thoroughly disgusted by a meal, but Brooklyn Heights Wine Bar & Kitchen was awful. Unfortunately, my husband and I went for a long walk without our cell phones so we blindly choose to eat brunch here. What a mistake.
Michael ordered the fruit and granola yogurt parfait which came with unripe strawberries and a frozen brick of yogurt. I ordered the Croque Monsieur which was not served on sourdough bread but an un-toasted thin slice of rye, deli ham, a white glop of glue which they tried to pass off as a bechamel, and an unseasoned handful of salad. The bartender/waiter could see that we were not
thrilled and offered to have the "chef"cook us something else, but the "chef" was no where to be found and Mike asked me to let it go. So, with a heavy heart, I let it go, tipped the server 20%, and walked out.
PS..... I found the "chef". He was sitting outside by the side of the restaurant in his dirty apron, talking on his cell phone. Go elsewhere my friends!

Reviews in here are mixes, but I am glad I just went in and gave it a try! I already knew by reading the reviews I could not trust those reviews *eye rolls when  I was reading them* - honestly it is very rare for me to leave a review but I felt I had to. Patrik (aka Patricio) treated me like royalty. I can tell his training in fine dining service. He was attentive and very very nice. If I happened to live here, and  wanted to go for something tranquil and comforting for a nice glass of wine and chill dinner, I would come here often. Again, really read the reviews and filter. Sometimes good businesses go down because of shity reviews.

A nice small wine bar serving brunch, wine and cocktails in Brooklyn Heights.  With time in my favor I rejoiced life with some wine.  Quality wine with knowledgeable bar tender and friendly service.  Happy Hour is only from Monday to Fridays-- no weekends.  The location is very convenient to the A, C train High Street.  A business card is available for grabs.  When scanning their brunch menu the cheese plates and select entrees were appealing for a return.  I was actually carded as my face does not match my age:

Can I See Some Identification?
Ergo all bouncers scrutinize to the tee
To exam my photo, memorize my mailing address
All the while doubting the authenticity of my DOB to match my face
How my luck reeks to be carded
Here, there wherever I go
Stop glaring at me
Yes, we Asians hide our age gracefully

I opt for one glass of red wine with bar tender Pam's suggestion.
Syrah, Thalvin Syrah (Morocco) 2011 $11.00-  very subtle red wine of a gentle finish with oak and cherry.  I actually did tasted the oak and the sniffed bottom of the oak barrel.  It was fruity.

Cute place

On a search for some downtown Brooklyn brunch eats, we tried two other places in the area for brunch but they were too packed, so we decided to hit up this place. *I do not care how nice/well reviewed  a place is; waiting more than 20 minutes for a table is way too long in a place like NYC.*

This is a nice, small wine bar that has an adequate brunch menu and an above adequate wine and cocktail menu. The day that we visited, the place was not crowded at all and we obtained a table right away. The service was pretty fast and the food was in the mediocre to good range. I take it that the wine and spirits are this place's claim to fame. As the name of the place would suggest, it has an great list of wines and cocktails. Be aware that the majority of the wines are Italian, but the wine bar even has a couple of reds from Morocco, which I have never seen before. Maybe next time, I will try one of the Moroccan blends.

Most of the brunch dishes range in the 11-16 dollar range. I tried the Country Quiche, which I was a little disappointing, because it did not have too much of a taste of anything. It seems as if the smoked bacon was left out of the quiche. I had to add a lot of salt and pepper to the dish, because it tasted like air. Aside from the dish, I really enjoyed my Brooklyn Beauty cocktail, which contains my two loves, gin and "bubbles" (prosecco).

Based on some of the previous reviews, I did not have an issue with the service at Brooklyn Heights Wine Bar & Kitchen.

I would give this place another shot, because of its extensive cocktail menu, which has mostly gin- and whiskey-based beverages. Hell, I may even through another glass (or three) of wine to that mix.

Afternoon at the Brooklyn flea market. BHWB is like the shirpas at base camp. Climb the hill a little to get to the Brooklyn Bridge walking path. The find this place to get you ready for the walk back to Manhattan. Or laugh at the people who need less blood in the alcohol stream after the crossing.

Check the specials for some good options.

I visited this small resto bar on New Years Eve and it was quite crowded by the time I arrived. I was really surprised by how small the place is.. although the ambience and vibe was really good. The menu had way less options to choose from. I ordered a garden vegetarian lasagna which was on the menu for that day. The quantity was way too less for the price.. but it was absolutely delicious. I give special appreciation to the chef. Overall, although the place is pricey and small, I would definitely visit again only for the food and service.

Not accommodating to birthdays--it was very offensive to the person who's birthday we were celebrating that we couldn't light a candle for their birthday. We even called the restaurant ahead of time.

I have had some excellent food here and some mediocre food here.  I give four stars because even the mediocre meal was an extremely pleasant and unpretentious.  The pozole, devils on horseback, French fries, Cobb salad, and chicken walnut salad were all excellent.  The charcuterie was not.

After a chilly walk over the Brooklyn Bridge on a Saturday afternoon, needed a quiet place to warm up and have a light snack. This spot is relatively closeby and a bit more inviting than the usual dimly lit wine bars.

Got a half-carafe of Montepulciano ($27) and a side of Home Fries ($4). The dark red was perfect after freezing our asses off outside, especially sitting next to the window and seeing others trying to brave the cold while we got warm. Home fries were nicely seasoned, going well with the red.

Service here is solid. They didn't try to rush us out despite just having a side and a drink. Although I don't come around this area often, I'll make a note if needing a spot to relax.

Nice small restaurant  with wide selection of wine and whiskey. I had a really tasty and well cooked lunch for $15 half chicken panini and hot peas cream soup.  The other choice was portobello panini and cold cucumber soup.
Clean, nice, fare prices, well served and the most important - tasty food!
Also need to admit a very convenient location close to the A train subway station. Good alternative to the Italian pizzerias at Old Fulton district just 5-7 minutes walk away.

Who: my boyfriend and I
When: may 28,2017 after the corgi Meetup on the hillside dog park, brunch time
Why: hungry after petting all the dogs

This place takes FOREVER at everything. Service was unbearably slow, it took 10 minutes after sitting down for someone to take out order (2 paninis). Then, it took over 45 minutes for our food to come out (during which time our water was not refilled). The food itself was fine but really something I could have gotten from any deli. Overall unimpressed.
Wouldn't come back.

Love this place! Great place to have dinner on a random week night, where you won't feel guilty for spending a fortune. This place is neighborhood, and cozy and delicious! My favorite meal is by far the boar ragu! It's amazing,really! The gnocchi tastes like delicious little pillows that are perfect to absorb the deliciously slow cooked sauce while the boar simply melts in your mouth. Their wine selection is respectable, and a good value. The service has always been great as well.
Definitely a place you want to put on your regular rotation!

Great place to chill. The wines are a great value, atmosphere is perfect with all the big windows. The samples of toasts and the pates are great options for complimenting your wine buzz.

I have some great memories of spending hours and hours here.

Never had the brunch, but sounds like it's not so great from other reviews. This place is meant for long evenings with wine. The food is simple and good but not the main show.
