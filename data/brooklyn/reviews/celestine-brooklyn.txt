Had a great birthday dinner at Celestine unfortunately due to the pandemic the back doors had to be left open which bought in all the cold air coming off the river into the restaurant where we sat; making it extremely cold and uncomfortable  . I would highly recommend that they invest in space hater for winter . Other than that our meal was delicious . We had the hummus , Pasta, Beef Brisket Burger, baked chicken with the feta cheese rice, cauliflower  and seafood appetizer . All fresh tasting, filled with flavor and cooked to perfection .

My husband took me here for my birthday last month. It was lovely. View was great and it was a pleasure to see the city skyline and bridge during these times. Service was friendly. Highly recommend for a nice dinner out.

Celestine is situated in a beautiful location with waterfront views of the East River and that of the Brooklyn Bridge.

In this day and age, the only time that I seem to visit any restaurant is due to a birthday celebration and this time was no different. Parking surprisingly wasn't that hard to come by. It could've had something to do with the time we went there, it was closer to closing, but they were still allowing people to come in.

When you get into the restaurant setting, you're directed to their patio like area that's literally a stones throw away from the water...if you have a good arm. They practice social distancing and offer you hand sanitizer both upon entry and at your table of choice. You're allowed to remove your mask once you're seated with your party and can eat in what I would consider, pre Corona normalcy.

The food didn't take too long to come, we ordered the House-made Za'atar Flatbread with Hummus for two, The One and Another One both with fries. I must say though, for a place that portrays itself as a Mediterranean style restaurant, they have some interesting names for their meals. I liked it though. It was kinda a nice play on words. Since this was my first time visiting this restaurant, I'm not sure if this was the updated menu due to Corona, but either way it created a relaxing feel and I honestly didn't feel as if I was eating at a Mediterranean restaurant.

When our orders came, it was wrapped in wrapping paper and aluminum foil. Sorta like a gift of some sort. The burgers were a huuuge disappointment for me. For what we paid, we certainly don't get what we paid for. The burger looked like something I could've made and even then it would've came out better. The lettuce was like the cheapest one you could get and it was so bulky that it overpowered the taste of the whole burger. I had to take it all out, because it made it feel like a cheap burger and it added nothing to it. Even without the lettuce, the burger fell flat. I think it was my last time getting "The One" and I most certainly didn't want "Another One". Now the Hummus and the Flatbread and even the fries were the stars of the night. They were equally appetizing and that's a crazy thing to say about some fries.

The music and the atmosphere reminded me of a late night barbecue in someone's backyard. The music was relaxing and very chill. Overall it was a nice venue with some over-priced food.

I was very excited to make a reservation here. I have been here before about a year ago for brunch and the food was great. However, I called today to make a reservation, and the woman with who I was trying to make a reservation was extremely rude to me on the phone and told me I should book online. I went online and I had to ask a question so I called back the restaurant. The same woman picked up the phone on me and was even ruder than previously.  I was so upset over this that I did not want to further book anything at this restaurant. This really left a bad taste in my mouth!!!

The food in here is just as amazing as the drinks and the view. Spectacular ambiance and Brooklyn Bridge view, but the service is horrible. We were served by Matt and he was just as rude as can be. Not 1 question kindly answered and just so impolite. They do no justice to how enjoyable this place could be

Celestine is situated in one of the nicest locales I've ever seen. Nestled under the Manhattan bridge, Brooklyn bridge park and water view, the skyline of lower Manhattan across the way all lit up. It's gorgeous, and that's why you pay what you do for a good restaurant. Not great. The food is good.

Service was very friendly and probably even a touch quicker than one would expect for a restaurant of a similar price tag. Our server, Logan, was particularly nice and offered us recommendations on a bottle of orange wine. Not made of oranges, but subtly delicious.

Starters, sides, and mains are all in the photos. Pita was a standout - not served too hot but warm and very fluffy with a nice dusting of za'atar. Hummus was good enough - could have used a little more. Olives were more for my girlfriend who enjoyed them.

Spicy lamb manti were nice and sans the typical cream which is fine by me. Flat iron steak was cooked to a rare perfectly. Pennsylvania chicken was done right as well.

In short, the food didn't wow us, the service was great, and the locale is spectacular, and this results in a price tag that tip-toes the line of unpalatable. This is a solid 4.

You really do pay for the location. The restaurant is situated right under the Manhattan bridge. It's a romantic setting, dimly light and a water/bridge view.

The menu is definitely smaller than most. Definitely a simple take on Mediterranean food. We got the red snapper and hummus to start. They were good, but nothing spectacular that I would  come back for. For entrees, we got the steak, chicken and tuna. All were cooked and seasoned well. Again, all were pretty good, but really nothing amazing. For what it is, their menu is way overpriced.

The service was good, food was decent, but was definitely expecting more based on the price range and location. Disappointed.

This restaurant is incredible! Had my post wedding dinner here in June of 2019. The scenery, food and staff were beyond amazing. This was my first experience at Celestine (my original reservation at another spot fell through and I am so glad it did as it lead me here!) I cannot stress enough how delicious the food is. Everything was so fresh, seasoned and cooked to perfection. I really hope to return some day soon!

I have been going back for work lunches and a few dinners, and after the experience the past few months I think it's time to break up.

I've experienced nothing but slow service without any explanations, meals that I've had to send back, unfriendly hostesses, and some salty meals.

Food is generally really good- but the service since they opened has gone downhill.

This is a new place near my office - and a great option for a nicer dinner with the team or clients. First, the view is phenomenal, I could sit there with a bottle of wine and be happy.

I went with a few friends and we immediately went back a few days later, I want to try their brunch! We each had a cocktail and loved them. I can't recall the names.

We split a few dishes both times:
1). Baba Ganoush - 5/5 so yummy
2). Muhammara - 5/5 very yummy
3). Hummus - 5/5
4). Flat Bread - 5/5
5). Branzino - 5/5
6). Short Rib Dumpling - 5/5
7). Green Bean Salad - 4/5

Service was good, but the food was amazing.

The food here was served fast. I liked the artichoke in the hummus. It tasted a bit like it also had some sort of floral ingredient. The flatbread was served with the mezze. The kale salad was passable, as well as the lamb wrap. All the food here was okay. Also, the portions were a bit on the smaller side.
Overall, I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again, but it is a nice restaurant with a great view. Their brunch menu needs a little work. I feel it lacked entree options.

A very good friend of ours had made brunch reservations on a beautiful spring Saturday and we arrived 25 mins later than our reservation time and were nervous that we'd lose our table. At 12:25 pm on a Saturday, we were seated right away and the place was half full, with outdoor seating being almost full, where we wanted to sit.

The view from our outdoor seating was beautiful. The only problem which made us move inside within 5 minutes, was too much wind and too less sunlight which was making it a bit chilly for us. On a perfect warm summer day, I'd highly recommend outdoor seating!

We started with some brunch cocktails which included Gamma and Jupiter, priced at $15 each. Both cocktails were decent, not enough kick to them though.

For Mezze, we got the Hummus and Baba Ghannouj ($9 ea) which came with pita bread. The Hummus was absolutely delicious. For mains, we got Steamed Egg ($16) and Chicken Thigh Kebab ($16). Both were very delicious, but i wish the portions were slightly bigger as far as meat was concerned. If you eat bread, the Chicken Thigh Kebab will stuff you but for all non-bread eaters, I'd recommend getting that plate with salad replacements. The thigh kebab although very delicious, barely had small pieces of chicken in it.

We also ordered the French Toast Casserole ($12) for dessert and it was absolutely amazing. One for the table was the perfect amount of sweetness we needed for our sugar craving.

Service was excellent and it was a very friendly staff who welcomed and served us that day. Noise levels were low making it a perfect spot to have conversations with your friends. Will definitely recommend this place for brunch or a romantic date night!

Absolutely delicious and GORGEOUS spot in Dumbo! I chose this place for a client lunch, and I got such great feedback about the spot from everyone.

After taking a look at the menu and ensuring that there were gluten free options for one of the guests, my coworkers and I decided on this restaurant and made our way over at noon on a Tuesday. The restaurant was quite empty when we arrived but began to fill up later by those who were opting to dine later.

There are huge windows and a beautiful wraparound patio that display the views of the bridges and river. We were given a corner table in full view of the beautiful day and amazing service by the staff.

We ordered the hummus and yogurt dips which came with the best flatbread I have ever had. Everything was wonderfully prepared and seasoned, and I was excited to try the main dishes. We all ended up ordering variations of the two salads they had, but we were all pleasantly satisfied. The salads were made with the best ingredients and everything was absolutely delicious.

I definitely want to come back and try more of their options, everything looked absolutely delicious!

My friends took me here for my birthday dinner. The food was artfully prepared and tasted delicious. They have a fresh interesting take on a few Middle Eastern and Mediterranean fare. The mezze platter was soooo yummy and easy to share. The za'atar spiced pita that comes with it is so delicious and soft. I highly recommend the branzino. The prices are a bit high however the food is worth it and the ambience is incredible. The view of 3 Brooklyn-Manhattan bridges and the east river and skyline are so mesmerizing. One thing about some of the dishes that was too great was the level of acidity. The orzo and 2 different spreads had way too much sour lemon/acid that it was hard to eat.

Celestine has such an amazing location right under the Manhattan bridge, the views can not be beat. They also open all the exterior windows in summer that you're basically sitting on the water.

The menu has some standard Mediterranean dishes plus some more unique things I hadn't tried before. But, literally everything was delicious. We had...
-baba ghannouj
-pistachio feta spread
-Manti (so good)
-reginette
-cauliflower & broccolini
-mjuderah
-Persian potato

I recommend anything I listed above. This would be a great place for a special occasion because the view is so spectacular. I'm excited to come back later in fall/winter and check out the cozy vibes.

This place completely charmed me! Sat down for dinner at 6 and didn't leave until 9 - we watched the beautiful sun set behind the Manhattan Bridge, Brooklyn Bridge, and Manhattan skyline through the floor-to-ceiling windows. It's seriously romantic. Plus the waterfront restaurant is tucked away in a quiet area in Dumbo, I couldn't resist walking around outside afterwards.

What's more, the food is also amazing! They're not just relying on this ideal location. Definitely get a few dips to start, they come with freshly grilled bread doused in olive oil and za'atar spice. The hummus (5/5) was refreshingly lemony, and the pistachio feta spread (5/5)  is surprisingly complex and light with lots of herbs. Highly recommend the short rib manti (5/5) - it's so tender and delicious, and the broth it's on is supercharged with flavor. It reminded me of a french onion soup. Don't look down on the salad (5/5) either - refreshing, thoughtful components with lots of crisp cucumbers and fennel, and I loved the cheese they use. You must get the chermoula branzino for 2 (5/5) - it was actually large enough for 3 of us to split. I've never had chermoula but I'm in love, I would spread that rub on anything. Order that with a side of cauliflower tempura (5/5), which is the more tender stemmed kind of cauliflower, super crisp and delicious. Finish on a light note with the blueberry tart (4/5) which I thought was better than the honey almond cake (3/5). They also give you small cookies with the bill.

From my scores, you can probably tell I loved almost everything about our meal with the exception of the desserts, which I think could be stronger. Also note that prices are a bit on the steep side, but when almost everything is perfect it is worth the price. It was truly one of the most enjoyable and memorable meals!

They do have tables outside but it was a little too warm and windy for us that day - and they ended up opening up the far wall so we had a breeze in the evening!

The food is as breathtaking as the view of the Manhattan bridge and the river. I ordered a chicken kebab dish and it came with braised vegetables with a thick tartar-like sauce which tied the elements all together.
We sat outside by the river, and the atmosphere is perfect for celebrating any special occasion- the sound of the waves crashing against the shore makes it too perfect.

Had lunch this week with good friends at Celestine. Great location. Really nice outside deck with an awesome water view. Not a great spot for a lunch in January but it's got to be fantastic in the warmer months.

Staff was friendly and accommodating. We ordered a garden salad with grilled chicken, garden salad with grilled shrimp, grilled vegetable platter, pasta with tomato sauce, hummus and pistachio dip. Menu features healthy choices. Great for vegetarians as there are many choices. Food was prepared well, fresh and tasty.

I'd recommend if you are health conscious and or a vegetarian. They have great options.

I went to Celestine with friends for a Sunday brunch...
Lovely setting (I mean, the view is AMAZING) and great food!
The menu is quite small (which I personally like) and there are some brunch classics with a middle eastern twist.
Definitely a spot to keep in mind!!

Expensive but worth it. There vulcan cocktail and wild bass was the best on the valentine's day pre-fixed menu.

The broccolini tempura is very surprising. Best tasting, healthy, snack In nyc.

I definitely recommend and would come back here for the outdoor view in the summer.

A great experience overall. The staff were so kind and made everything pleasant despite the stressful situation restaurants are in. And everyone was wearing masks and being respectful.
The kale salad was a great light snack and the cocktails are so good! This is definitely a patio experience worth checking out.

Celestine has a gorgeous view right next to the Manhattan bridge. I came here for a client dinner and the views were stunning with the bridge lights and dimmed candlelight ambience. I think this would be a great place for a date night as well. We did a family style meal with various appetizers, mains and desserts. We had a couple drinks while we were waiting for the full party to arrive and I gotta say I loved the turmeric gin & tonic. You wouldn't typically expect a turmeric based drink to be good but they really did a great job with this one. The ginger and lime ingredients really complimented the drink. I also tried Pearable (pear, tequila, chile) and Olympia (vodka, raspberry, lemon, sparkling wine) which were tasty as well. For the food, I think the house-made flatbread was incredibly delicious, both soft and crispy with some evoo sprinkled on top. Their hummus and babaganoush went perfectly with the flatbread - wish they had given us more of it! I also really enjoyed the roasted winter squash dish which sat on a bed of orzo with hazelnuts and cranberries. The squash was nicely roasted on the outside and soft (but not in a super mushy way) on the inside. My favorite main dish was the steak, which was cooked medium rare and extremely tender and seasoned well. This dish was also huge and came after a many platters of apps and starters, so we couldn't finish it but we did take it to go to enjoy the next day. The desserts were classic Mediterranean desserts - the halva and honey almond cake - and very good!

A hidden treasure near the Manhattan Bridge! Views are amazing on a clear day, even when indoors. My friend and I ordered the Baba Ghannouj, Kale Salad, Shakshuka, and the French Toast Casserole. Baba Ghannouj was AMAZING. We split the flatbread, seasoned with lots of spice and herbs. The hummus had a tinge of spice in it as well and is flavorful enough to keep you occupied until the main dishes arrive.

I first tried the French Toast. It has a nice maple syrup consistency that holds it together. The bread is made softly and has a vanilla taste. It has the perfect amount of sweet and sour, I highly recommend!

I really liked the shakshuka as well. It tastes like a healthier alternative to Italian pizza. There is a lot of tomato, however, so avoid if you don't like it.

I didn't try the kale, but it looked pretty good from my angle.

Overall, the place's atmosphere with soft music, green plants, wood walls, big windows, proximity to the bridge, and food options are a solid 5/5. I'd definitely recommend for those who wander around Dumbo.

Celestine is my go-to when meeting up with family or taking them out to BK! The views in all seasons are super prestine and the service is exceptional!

The food is very simple, so if you are looking for something to make you full, this place isn't exactly that - but it does the job of ensuring that you aren't over eating.

I love this place and I hope it stays a while

I have picked Celestine to celebrate our 2nd wedding anniversary. Although their website clearly states that they cannot guarantee specific tables I have enquired about a nice seating as I wanted it to be a special evening. We were greeted promptly on our arrival. The restaurant wasn't super busy however most of the tables on their terrace seemed taken. They have given us a table inside but by the window so we could still get the nice view on the bridge and stunning evening skyline. Our server(s) were very swift and friendly. ( polite note- don't clear plates until all parties finished eating ).
We went for the "family style" set menu with the main course of chicken and sword fish. Chef has sent mezze appetisers with some flat bread and olives -delicious! as well as some accompaniments like melon with our mains. We wrapped up our meal with an almond cake and coffee mousse. Both delicious!!!! Italian sparkling wine complemented our meal beautifully.
On a down note the restaurant was a bit warm inside... we didn't want to case a fuss and ask for a table outside but perhaps we should have as there was a nice breeze coming from the river and few tables became available.Perhaps on our next visit! It's a very chic and intimate restaurant with a beautiful views and dimmed lights. It was just perfect for the occasion. Everyone made our evening enjoyable. We shall be back!

Extremely pricey with unfocused service.   You are mostly paying for the view, which is the underside of the Manhattan Bridge, which makes me wonder if even that is worth the price.  Still at sunset, with the all glass walls and the gentle setting, it is a lovely moment.

Drinks were novel and good.  Room pretty.  People also pretty.

However, the service left much to be desired.  The room was not full, and yet we suffered long waits for our courses and for our server's attention.
Our server floated about the room, exhibiting a casual, chatty manner, which, although it might delight some customers to have one's server making extended small talk at one's table, failed to deliver the attentive experience that I would expect for the very dear price this establishment demands for its Mediterranean offerings, many of which are simply street food with lipstick painted on (falafel, hummus, etc...).

I had the Flatiron steak, which consisted of 8 or 10 slices of tender and nicely seasoned meat but for the price, I could have enjoyed a formidable, dry aged 16 oz New York Strip at many a well known steakhouse in NYC.  My companions ordered the whole Branzino.  Again, delicious and tender, but for the price not so sure it was worth it.

The bill when it arrived, was heart stopping.  Never again.

The walk along the water following the dinner was the highlight of the evening.  It was a lovely night, comfortably temperate, with a light breeze.

Wonderful, thank you for accommodating my group for brunch today.  First of when I arrived both the host and hostess were beyond friendly and inviting.

First thing you notice is how busy Celestine is. They are a newbie but the word is spreading.  Once inside the most beautiful table was set and waiting for my party.  But, wait, we sat in the window taking in the most amazing views.

About our waiter? He was cheeky, full of life, loved his glasses, and he knew the menu. This would be food and drinks. As he gave the verbal rundown one could vividly imagine the dishes described and hunger started to kick in, as anticipation built on trying one of the dishes by there sheer description. He recommended I have the lamb, as he stated, "you just can't go wrong with it."

You might ask yourself why I kept referring to my waiter as "he" that's my fault not his. However, his clear eye glasses were on point!

[*Carl, that's the name of the chap who waited on us!]

Drinks, yes delish from the yellow jacket to the mezcal cocktail. The baba ganoush was simply divine - creamy, well spiced, and portions were on point.

This is a must place to brunch with friends and people watch. The service is top notch, and everyone touches base on entry and exit, giving you that personal touch.  Plus, smiling faces everywhere.  That is a huge bonus.

This is a date spot alert.  Views, sunset, cocktails - midsummer night outdoor seating. It's a recipe for fun fun fun!!!

Unfortunately, despite calling ahead to ensure we would have a table, the hostess was intent on articulating that the restaurant is not a welcoming place for customers. We arrived with less than 5 occupied tables in the place, and the restaurant remained largely empty through the course of our meal.

Yet, when we walked in, no one greeted us, leaving us to stand by the door for nearly a minute, wondering if they were actually open for business. When the host finally graced us with her presence, she started the interaction by rolling her eyes while asking if we made a reservation. We did. Went downhill from there.

There were leftover food bits on the unwashed drinking glass at our table. When I pointed the dirty dish out to our waiter, instead of handing us a clean glass from the multiple unoccupied tables next to us, he left to "get us a new glass". This took over 8 minutes. The water we asked for took over 15 minutes to arrive. Drinks (draft beer) also took unusually long, considering that the restaurant was empty.

The food was clearly microwaved and drenched in stale olive oil to compensate for the rubbery texture. Previous reviews also echo this. The view is nice, but not worth the abusive service athmosphere! If you want to watch the view from here, be mentally prepared for bad vibes and extremely overpriced and subpar food.

This is the only expensive restaurant where I have actually thought the food worth it. I came here for dinner as a Turk, expecting to be disappointed as I am with most Mediterranean-themed restaurants. I ordered the octopus dish with ayran, expecting to be served the Turkish yogurt drink alongside some grilled octopus. When it came out, there was no sight of ayran. I asked the waiter where it was. He said, "It's right there. It's in the sauce." And there it was. That was a first.

Skeptical, I tried the food. The main dishes were surprisingly not very Mediterranean--there are just 3, and one of them is called "Pennsylvania chicken". I don't remember PA being anywhere near Mare Nostrum. Despite this, the chicken was delicious. In fact, it was one of the most delicious dishes I have ever had. My partner had the vegetarian carrot dish, which was surprisingly filling and almost as good.

Celestine definitely has an innovative chef at work. One thing about Mediterranean food is that it has not been very creative since the 19th century, when many classics were invented. That also makes it hard to get very wrong. Celestine takes a chance with its food. And it works really, really well.

Been wanting to go to this place for a long time and finally ended up going here for a Friday night date with my boyfriend. Although we had reserved a table at 8, surprisingly it was not so packed by the time we got there. The restaurant is built on the waterfront, you can see the Manhattan bridge of you sit near the window. Unlike the River cafe by Brooklyn bridge, Celestine is less expensive and doesn't require formal attire which made both of us very comfortable. The food is very authentic Mediterranean, the waitress who served us is very sweet, she kept on asking if we needed anything else and recommended good dessert. The atmosphere in the restaurant is romantic and classy, perfect for date nights. In my opinion Celestine is the best option for a waterfront dining experience around DUMBO

Celestine is a holy grail. You get a gorgeous Manhattan view while dining riverside without paying a premium for the experience- all the while eating delicious food! Bonus: they carbonate their water in house so you can get bottomless sparkling water for free!

We stumbled upon Celestine after bouldering at DUMBO on a wonderful sunny day. Celestine has a unique setup. There's a large spacious indoor dining space, but the walls that face the waterfront are actually glass doors that can open up to create an airy dining atmosphere. They also have true outdoor dining tables around the perimeter outside the restaurant. We sat at a table indoors right next to the doors that opened up to the river- fresh air in the shade!

We ordered the hummus platter to share, and they gave enough pita bread that each person at the table could have one. Interestingly, because of the way the pita was arranged, one pita got all the olive oil and spice, and so we had to smear the oil on all the other pieces of pita bread.

This was my first time ordering a salad at a restaurant (other than my weekly Sweetgreen trips), but I couldn't resist because the Baby Kale Salad looked delicious! I thought the Bee Pollen vinaigrette would taste more like honey, but honestly, it tasted more vinaigrette than any other bee-like product. The freekeh and mushroom (yum!) helped to make the salad a lot heartier.

This is definitely on my list of favorite restaurants thanks to the awesome al fresco dining option and gorgeous view. I will be coming back time and time again with visitors!

Beautiful restaurant and impeccable food. I was thoroughly impressed because I did not expect the food to be so good. The restaurant is not that big and don't worry every table has a great view. Elaine took great care of us and was so friendly and sweet.

We had the platter for appetizer, along with crispy falafel and short rib dumplings. For entree we had the chicken and the branzino, Brussels sprouts and lentil and rice. Every dish was so flavorful and delicious. The branzino was cooked to perfection, Probably one of the best I've tried. The chicken was delicious and came with grapes and nuts. The was surprised how well the ingredients went, because I would never imagine grapes in my chicken.

I love that they have a seasonal menu. I will definitely return in the summer to experience their out door seating and lunch menu.

Views here are pretty great! In addition it's not crowded and most of the clientele are families and younger professionals -- so super chill and not too busy.

The menu and food here is pretty simple there isn't much to chose from, I'm not super into Mediterranean food however I didn't mind it!

I did love the flatbread and the pistachio dip! So so good!

The service was excellent and all very very kind!

I would come back on a summer/spring day however it's a little bit pricey!

Great views. The highlight was the baba ganoush, hummus was just ok, the flat bread and za'tar the first round were good the 2nd round burnt.
The mushrooms/kale reginette had burnt pieces of, apparently kale, which made us leave the dish unfinished.
The falafel/thahini and mushy peas were good.
So a star for the food and a star for the view.
Our server, whoever had a man-bun, took the order and never came back, we went through our entire dinner and he didn't check on us once, the host brought us a bottle of water, refill, after we flagged him over since our waiter was completely ignoring us. We decided to just get the check and leave, not a pleasant evening, sad.

The best part of this restaurant is the view. We waited over an hour to be seated, the hostess was a mess. If you're planning on going here, definitely make a reservation. She didn't make us feel welcome at all.  Once we were finally seated, the waitress refused to take an order for an appetizer and informed us that she would only take a full order. Reviewing the menu was quick since its such a short menu, and we're finally able to put in an order. The Za'tar flatbread was first to come out, and honestly was disappointing. The bread was burnt in spots, overly oiled and barely had any Za'tar on it. The chicken entra was delicious. Unfortunately, my wife found a little cockroach on her table napkin. The waitress gave us a new napkin and explained that the door was open for outdoor seating.

Overall this place has a great view, but is slow in seating and service while serving pretentiously made food without attention to detail. The value is existent- you're paying for the view. I liked this spot the first couple times, but I think I'm over it now.  Plenty of other options with great views in Dumbo.

I went here for a lunch date. We sat inside and it was quiet and relaxed. The view was so nice and it's in such a nice location. The wait staff were so nice and the service was prompt and polite.

We ordered the pistachio feta spread (think hummus), the lamb wrap, and the beef brisket burger. The pistachio hummus was absolutely amazing. I'm a huge fan, it was a little on the salty side, but hey, I love salt, bring it on. The lamb wrap was also really good, although I tend to not be a huge fan of lamb. The burger I was a little disappointed in. It was kind of a greasy mess and the brioche bun it came on just got so soggy. It did come with some cute pickled (radish?) thing that was super yummy! And the fries were salty and slightly spicy in a delicious way.

What a beautiful place for brunch!! The view is stunning.   Great place for a celebration or to impress an out of towner.  Good service.

The food

I started with the mezcal cocktail and it is delicious!!  Yes to this!
After that we had:

Shakshuka -  very tasty!  Added harissa for an additional kick.
Lamb kebab-  good but not great.
The bread that comes with each dish is also very good.  No need to order separately.
