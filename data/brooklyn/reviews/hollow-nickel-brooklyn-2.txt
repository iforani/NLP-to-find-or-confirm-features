Went to hollow recently & OMG!!!! Best time ever considering Covid rules! They had masks ready for you along with handy dandy sanitizer upon arriving as well as going into the cozy backyard as well as providing OFF! For those mosquitoes!!!! The bartender there was beyond attentive and great personality . Can't wait to return!!!

Came here after a breakup once. The bartender (I want to say Abby or Addie, but I drank a lot that night) was the perfect mix of sympathetic and encouraging, but she gently watered me every so often and made sure I didn't overdo it. A beautiful red-headed angel. She gave some solid recommendations given that I wanted to drink but I'm picky af.  She started me off with a rum concoction that was pleasant at first but then tasted maybe gasoliney?, and then she made me something that tasted just like Jolly Ranchers. I drank it and I liked it, sorry not sorry.

She wasn't drunk but it felt so much like those one-night friendships drunk girls have at the club. Thank you, alcohol-bearing angel.

This has become a favorite bar lately, and the reasons for that are fivefold:

1. It happens to be located almost exactly halfway between me and a friend of mine, who also happens to have a moderate alcohol problem (in that we need it sometimes) and likes to meet up to solve it.

2. The fried pickles. Whether or not you'd like to refer to these as "frickles," the ones at Hollow Nickel are nothing short of outstanding.

3. The rest of the food. They really fry everything well (like sweet potato fries), but it's all been pretty solid.

4. A solid happy hour, staffed by great bartenders. I'm not going to elaborate on this because it's self-explanatory.

5. The space is good, and the backyard is GREAT. So much more spacious and comfortable than you might imagine.

Cute bar but the food seems average.
On a Sunday night not too crowded. Came here for a friends birthday and it was just our group occupying the back of the place for a while which was nice. They have a really cool gas fire place on the back, adds to the cozyness. I like the layout of the tables also. Lots of big tables and booths and circle booths too.

Got the chicken fingers because the menu said hand battered. And I always love chicken fingers from scratch. But they over fried them. They were way to dark almost burnt. They gave 4 for $9. One was chewy and inedible so really 3. My friends liked their hotdog, fries and hamburger though. Maybe if I come here again I will try the hamburger. Wait staff and bar staff where nice too. But overall just an average spot, nothing standout.

I feel conflicted about the review because it really depends on what you're looking for. Came here for a quick, casual dinner - burgers and beer. And for that, this place delivers. They have a $15 burger + draft beer deal that is hard to beat. But...the burger's not great quality. The fries were solid, but honestly I think the burger was so greasy my stomach revolted.

The good: beer selection is fine, and the bartenders are really cool. Will probably come back for late night drinks, but skip the burger next time.

Great little bar with cute outdoor space. It has become our place while I worked in Brooklyn. We used to go there frequently (even though I now work in the Bronx I still make it out there once in a while). The tap list is small but decent. Drinks are good and strong. They have delicious sweet potato fries and wings and the chicken tenders are pretty good for a bar. Good happy hour specials. We love to take over one of the tables outside and just hang out for hours.

Came here for dinner one sunday night. Moderately busy, but we grabbed a spot at the bar.  Bartender was very friendly and helped us decide our drinks and meals. Beer selection is good miix off staples and some quality crafts. I went with the buffalo  chicken wrap, which was very good. Good crispy chicken with juicy white meat. My girlfriend got the burger, also well prepared. Overall a solid spot for sure.

Like this spot a lot for a relaxing hang in my neighborhood. In the winter there's a fire in the back and the backyard is delightful in the summer.
Really good beer and shot combos; beer and burger combo; beer and hot dog combo... you get the picture.
I would not call this a dive, it's far to clean for that, but it's also not stuffy, nor too self-conscious. Just a great neighborhood spot.

This was one of a handful of places near our hotel that was open late and still serving food. Bartenders were pretty friendly and accommodating and let us know we could sit anywhere but needed to come up to the bar to put in any drink or food orders. Fair enough.

Overall vibe... hipsterish. Cheap drinks, decently priced food, low lit, a bit of a grungy vibe to it, but I was diggin' it. Fellow patrons were pretty friendly as well as I recall a guy recommending a beer to me and said if I ordered it he'd get the next one on him. That was nice of him, but didn't take him up on the offer as I just was looking for a late night dinner and beer and planned to head out. Overall a decent sized bar with a good amount of folks on a late wednesday night watching the Lakers game. Kind of felt like I was back in LA for a bit (whoop whoop).

Anyways, for food I was quite impressed with the burger. Hard to say if it was actually as good as I remember or if I was just starving having flown in late and not eaten yet. But for $14 will get ya a burger and beer combo. Not much to it, just a special juicy blend, cooked to your liking and served with lettuce, tomato, and onion. They patty was perfectly cooked medium as I requested and definite a unique spice blend they use on it but delicious. Also shared an order of the chicken tenders which were uniquely battered with panko for extra crispiness and the honey mustard and bbq sauces tasted homemade and were great as well.

Glad we lucked out on this spot so late at night as it was just what we were looking for.

'Til next time, cheers!

Man I really don't know how I feel  about being that guy that gives every place 4stars but if you're every near BARCLAYS center and love a good dive bar with GREAT food please come here !!!

Highlight was leaving March Madness and continued watching Richmond (aka my 7th graders college class name) on the screen.

FOOD:

Wings are beyond phenomenal. Like had I known the were that good I would've deaded all the other orders and got 50wings. It's hard to describe what makes a good wing Bc so many components go into it. Ima keep it short: juicy and crisp at the same time.

JunkyardDog: I mean a hot dog with no nitrates is always the wave. I slacked not getting it bacon wrapped.

Quesadill: Top Notch - you can tell The ironed it on a plancha!

Burger & Beer Combo: My friend said it was cooked to perfection!!

AMBIANCE:

Dive bar, def a date spot. Small cozy and to the point.

SERVICE:

They don't give a fuck about serving you lol ask for a menu at the bar , shut up, sit down, order your amazing grub, and enjoy.

Delicious, no complaints.

The fried pickles are a must.
My BLT was delicious and came with a salad (which I'd usually skip, but the dressing was so good).
Boyfriend enjoyed his burger I might have stolen a bite.

Great food, nice bartender and server. Would come back here!

buffalo wrap was good. I like how they put the whole wrap on the flat top to heat it. It gives it a crunchy exterior. The breaded chicken is cooked well. I would say the flavor is pretty good. I though there were too many raw onions but that is just for my taste.

The bar area is cool with a little bit of a hipster feel to it.

There is a small kitchen so it is very cool that they can pump out decent food.  Cool place.

Always walk by this spot but decided to stop by and check out the place. Walked in to an attentive bartender by the name of Mark that made me feel welcomed. Wooded out interior. Booths to sit with friends as well as a backyard for sitting out under the sun. Sat at the bar & ordered a burger and fries and man it was juicy & I couldn't even eat it all. Had a Carlsberg and even chatted with the neighbors who are regulars. Cool spot. I'll stop by again.

If I'm heading toward Barclays area for whatever reason I like to pop into Hollow Nickel. Great happy hour deals, and even better beer and shot for $6 all day. The back is nice and chill to hang with friends in the warm weather days. Also, the food is surprisingly good! The chicken fingers are my favorite, super crispy and large, almost like schnitzel fingers if I were to rename them. The fried pickles equally crispy and well seasoned. My buddy said the burger was really good, came with a beer for $15 if I recall.

You won't feel hollow coming here, and you won't have to spend too many of your hard earned nickels to have a good time. Oooof, ok, cheesemiestro out.

This is awesome place to get a drink and meet local people.  The vibe is very chill and most people are open and friendly. The service is great. My usually bartender ( Anna) when I'm visiting from California is super sweet and friendly. If you are in the area , this is one of the places you should visit. I'm definitely a return patron and I live in another state!!

This is a great little dive bar. I loved the pickle backs. Perfect bourbon pairing and pickle juice had spice to it. Had burgers and fries pickles with colleague. Food was good. Unremarkable but not disappointing.  Great vibe. Inexpensive. I'll definitely return. Kinda average for Brooklyn but exactly what was needed.

Came in on a Sunday afternoon walking through the neighborhood. Small, quaint, friendly bartender who was beyond helpful. Great drink deals! Even better burgers though! I was not expecting such a great tasting patty. Wings were awesome too, had the Korean bbq flavored and you get a lot for the price. Clean bathroom. Will for sure go back.

I wish I could rate this place but my wife and I walked out in 5 minutes.  This place is a DIVE!!!!!
And not in a good way!!!

Okay, we walked in at 6:30 on a Saturday evening. There were 2 bartenders, and the place was reasonable crowded.  Did not see a hostess/host, waiter/ waitress to seat us, so we just sat down, no big deal.

We sat at a little bar stool, and did not see any servers.  I walked up to the bar, and looked into the kitchen, and saw wrap on the counter just sitting there with lettuce and tomatoes.  The cook was walking around the bar, and looked like he wasn't focused on food. The 2 bartenders were busy, but were too cool for school, and were focused on serving.

I looked back at my wife sitting at the table, and what looked like a homeless women was sitting in my seat with a doll talking to my wife. She asked my wife if she like her baby!  I went back to my wife and said let's go, and the women said to me, "I am talking to her!"

I don't know who owns this place but they should read this...
1. Absent Service on a busy Saturday night
2. A disgusting looking kitchen, and a cook who definitely was not interested in what he was doing
3. Homeless/ mentally ill people allowed to walk around the bar, and harass customers.  I don't think this is good for business in my opinion.

I went to this place because the ratings were really good.   I'm sure the people who rated this place were sincere.  What the hell happened?  Maybe the owner of this place doesn't give a f**k anymore, and wants to let it go.

Alright happy hour spot close to Barclays Center. $5 well drinks, $6 margaritas and wine and beer specials 4-7. First vodka club was on the bartender which was super kind. Also tried the "Rosemary's Baby" gin cocktail which was not on HH and a little sweet for my taste. Ordered a Hollow Nickel salad with mesclun, goat cheese, candied walnuts and dried cranberries. Pretty good and a satisfying portion. Tried some guacamole and wasn't crazy about it. Chips were VERY salty.

Overall a solid choice for HH or a casual drink on Atlantic Ave. Would return.

Came in to get out of the heat and get some brunch while my daughter was at an event at the roulette across the street . Air was cranking, bartender friendly, atmosphere comfortable. Got the breakfast burrito w fries for $13. Fries kinda raw but burrito was awesome. Would return.

This place was great! I stopped here before a show at Barclays.

The setting is pretty intimate - I wish I lived closer to this place.

I had the BLT and the fried pickles. Both were really good - I would definitely order them again!

Next time I'm at Barclays I'll definitely stop by this place.

Didnt try any food but it looks decent.  Scored the last solo bar atool at the full but not overly crowded bar on a Tue at 6pm.  I like the simple menu. $4 buds, 5 corona, 6 stella and heiny and 7 for guiness.  9 and up for wine. Simple system, simple crowd.  Gonna try ot on a weekend brunch.

Came here for brunch with high hopes, but they got shot down faster than a runaway squirrel.

The veggie burger was unappetizing and bland in flavor. So I deconstructed it to the bun and egg, which were palatable on their own.

The service was inattentive to the point that I had to walk up to the counter and demand my check after 15 minutes of finishing what I could on my plate.

However, the remeding qualities of my experience were the side salad and my friend's burger, which were adeqaute. All in all, not really a spot for a vegetarian like me.

Great place to grab a drink and some bar food.  It gets pretty full at random times but I've never had a problem getting a seat/service. They have good happy hour deals and shot deals (beer and a shot, pickleback shot deal, etc.) and a great selection of whiskey.  The bar food here is pretty satisfying, and I sometimes find myself craving the chicken fingers.  If it's a warm day, you should definitely check out the backyard!

We happened to be driving down Atlantic ave one night and we saw this local bar. It looked nice kind of like a comfy sports bar from the outside so we pulled over & went in for a beer.
It's a nice space and I can see myself having a good time here, however when we were there, there was a really loud hipster chic loudly discussing some music album with the bartender. Energy here was a bit bougie and hipsterish. We drank 1/4 of our beers and just left..
Beer selection was really small. (Also they don't carry Heineken) and the draft picks we got sucked.. menu didn't seem so appealing either..
Maybe we'll be back to give it another try in the summer since they have an outdoor area.

This bar is amazing! Bartender Jamie is super friendly and happy. WAY better than the salty experience we had down the street at Robert Bar.

But seriously Jamie is super amazing and should be here every night. SUCH a great face for this business.

This is a review for food only! In short, food took too long to come out (almost 40 minutes for 3 plates) and food did not taste good.

Came here right after a Nets game to grab a quick bite. But little did we know our quick bite was gonna last over an hour. Got here around 1015pm with 2 other ppl. We ordered quickly at the bar, 2 (cooked medium) burgers with fries, and a shepherds pie.

Then we waited, and waited and waited. 30 minutes in, we asked the bartender where our food was, and he's like it's coming out. 10 minutes later (past 11pm already!) the 2 burgers come out and they were definitely NOT cooked medium. Both burgers were too done, and the outside of the meat was all burnt. It was so dry and we were not happy with the burgers, but we were hungry and it was getting late, so we ate it anyway. Fries were overly salty.

My shepherd's pie came several minutes after the burgers. I've never really ordered shepherd's pie before so I don't really have anything to compare it to, but it was not good. Basically it was mashed potatoes with ground up slurry of meat. The taste was just alright.

Fyi, think there was only 1 cook in the kitchen so that's probably why it took so long, but nonetheless, I'm still giving it a 1 star review cuz I had a 1 star experience regardless of the conditions.

Highly recommend.
With short notice to bartender Jean and the excellent kitchen staff, 13 thirsty, hungry people descended on the Hollow Nickel after a fabulous visit to the nearby Transit Museum. We received terrific service from this "order food at the bar" establishment. Met some other wonderful patrons who had also been to the Transit Museum that day. First timers to both the Museum and the Hollow Nickel, we all had a great time.
The menu is nicely varied pub food. A breakfast burger and fried pickles were our more adventurous choices. Lots of great burgers cooked to order, chicken wings, tomato soup and grilled cheese for the young at heart. The beer choices on draft were great. Loved my IPA.
Wish this place were closer to home. I'd be there every weekend.
Close to the Barclay Center if you're in for an event.  Has an outdoor back patio which looked nice though a little too chilly outside today for any of my group.

Hollow Nickel has two things that make a great bar - a good whiskey selection, and an amazing backyard. I've passed by this place many times while walking home and never really stopped in. But I had some time to kill and decided to take the plunge.

They have a very respectable whiskey/bourbon/Scotch selection, all for very reasonable prices. Laphroaig was $12 and Blanton's was $13. I've definitely paid more for both.

The backyard is pretty huge. It's nicer than 4th Ave Pub and is a lot more open. Great place to be during the spring or summer months.

Sad that it took so long to get my ass over here, but I'll definitely be returning!

It took me way too long to try this place.  Small but lots character.  Tap selection is solid and having Blue Point Toasted Lagers at $5 (and not just at happy hour) makes me excited.   Other beers are $7 and at this point I will take that price since beer prices seem to be creeping up in BK lately.  I recently saw a Bells Two Hearted for $9 at a bar in Greenpoint .  Bartender acknowledge us right away when we walked in and even said goodbye to us as we were leaving.  Maybe I am old school but I miss that at bars lately when the bartenders act too pretentious.  We didn't order food, but I would come back and try for sure.  One tv in the corner is perfect for your sports game fix.

I came here with a group of eight people before a concert down at the Barclays Center.  We made it in time for happy hour and were able to find seating out back under the string lights at a longer picnic table.  I would recommend this place for a happy hour or their $12 burger and a beer special.

A lucky find for a pre-concert pregame.

Unpretentious, low key bar right on Atlantic Ave.

Love the tin ceiling, booth seats and shelves with real books (yes, real!). There is also room on the back with more seatings and backyard, but it was reserved the night we were there, so I could not check it out.

They have TV for all you sport fans!

Good beer selection. Food is simple, but pretty great. Fries were good, and BLT was very, very nicely put together - perfectly toasted bread, thick-cut bacon, fresh tomatoes - delish!!!

Now, someone please, please tell me the meaning of abbreviation on the mirror??? I will love you forever if you do!

Stumbled into Hollow Nickel on a rainy Sunday when we were in need of shelter from the rain.

Food is about three stars, but the service pushes Hollow Nickel to four stars.

The ordering (at least on a Sunday) is DIY, but we didn't mind with Abbey's friendly demeanor. :)

Protips:
$6 Pickle back shots
$7 beers on tap

Good rock and roll tunes as well.

Thanks for the great service, Abbey. We enjoyed staying dry with you!

It was a pretty good vibe. I like the decor. I had a chicken sandwich, my boyfriend had the burger. He wanted a second burger. My only criticism would be more seasoning on the fried chicken and a nice sauce would take that sandwich beyond anyone's expectations. Also we didn't like that the bartender kept going out for smoke breaks.

Came here to check out a bar with food. Cool little spot with decent drink deals. I stuck with the shot and a beer (Narraganset & Evan Williams for $6). We tried the nachos which boasted homemade chips. I don't know if they were homemade but, they're delicious. Someone else complained theirs were cold. Ours were warm but, could of used more time to melt all the cheese. Their salsa also tasted like there was pickle juice in it, not into that. Also had the tenders which were very crispy and were great. Affordable prices and so far everything g was good. Good amount of seating in the back, still small place though. Staff was very pleasant as well.

My friend found this place on Yelp and decided to have happy hour/dinner here on a Friday evening around 6pm. Judging from the reviews and pictures, we decided to give this place a try.

Once we stepped in, it was CROWDED. The only available seats we saw were by the window and seated ourselves. There were shot glasses and glass cups everywhere. No one came around to cleaning them so we just pushed them aside. There was a huge blackboard with a mini menu and also a small paper menu floating around from table to table.

Went to the bar and ordered the turkey toastie for myself & the angus burger for my friend and drinks. Asked for a malibu bay breeze and blue hawaiian and the bartender that helped me said they don't carry malibu and I just settled for a cider. Waited on the blue hawaiian for a bit and she never came back with it. When I finally got her attention again, I asked her where was the blue hawaiian and her response was 'what's in that again?' I'm sorry, but how are you a bartender and not know what's in a blue hawaiian? When I told her she said they didn't carry blue curacao.

Whoever she was, she must be new. I wish I got her name because she was clueless throughout the whole time I was there. I had to repeat my order to her twice and the order number twice. I told her I wanted the burger medium and it came out well done. The turkey toastie was your typical turkey sandwich drenched in butter. The fries that came with it were super salty. When we were finish, I went to close my tab and it took forever to get her attention. She looked over at me a couple of times and totally ignored me when I tried to wave her down and she decided to help others instead. Super annoyed, I just waved down another worker to close the tab for me.

Overall, the worst experienced ever. The food was mediocre, the service was terrible, the selection was limited and it was disgusting inside. Save yourself the trouble and avoid this place. You'll probably have a better experience at Applebee's inside Atlantic Terminal.
