One of my new favorite upscale restaurants. I came here while there was outdoor seating, and the restaurant basically wrapped around 2 blocks of streets. I'm glad that they were able to maintain a large capacity during the pandemic.

The pull-apart bread is one of the best breads out there. It's a MUST-TRY since it's fluffy and delicious. I would come back to the restaurant just for the bread. Everything else we ordered was tasty as well.

One of my main concerns is the lack of vegetarian entrees. When I went, there was one pasta on the menu that was vegetarian, but checking online now, the menu changed and it doesn't look like it's available anymore.

I'll be back when they have a new vegetarian option and to try the dessert, which isn't included in the prix fixe (but was still too much food for us to order the dessert separately last time). Would definitely recommend you try this place out, even if just for the bread.

I'm so glad that Crown Shy can operate during the continuation of the Covid pandemic. The Eleven Madison Park pedigree shines through with tasteful food at much lower prices. Presentation was great, visually the food was as good as my taste buds experience.

Cocktails were fine, my wife had one of the mezcal based one, I only had a glass of red - Cabernet By the glass was killer.

Overall, very well executed, and I went in August before indoor dining was aloud. There outdoor space is great on the weekends as the little road is closed.

This was an amazing outdoor experience during covid and some of the best food I've had. You do have to make reservations but there is no time limit for your table. The menu is a three course tasting which a few choices, and their delicious bread comes free. The short rib special which was melt in your mouth good. For cocktails, the flightplan and radicle were delicious as well as a 2013 port with dessert. Sticky toffee pudding was so good. They did forget our dessert and one cocktail until they were reminded but gave me an extra pour to compensate. Well worth it!

I have to say, Crown Shy blew me away.

I made reservations when NY was just allowing indoor reservations and was a little nervous about how it would work. The tables were far apart enough to be distanced but not too much where it feels awkward. They are only serving the prix fixe menu which I have no complaints about. The service was great, I never looked around for someone to help or for anything. Bonus points for a completely touchless payment and spray hand sanitizer for the table.

We started with the pull apart bread. Delicate and exciting enough to make you anxious for the next dish. Next came the white bean hummus. We had fun with the creative vehicles that were provided for our hummus. Overall the hummus was really flavourful and light at the same time. For our appetizers, I got the romaine salad and my boyfriend got the honeynut squash. He was really impressed by the dish and every bite it provided.

For our entrees, we got the chicken liver cavatelli and the steak (which is not listed on the menu). We had to pay extra for the steak but trust me when I say, it's.worth.every.penny. The steak was so perfectly cooked that it was hard to process really. The cavatelli was good but the liver was a bit tough. You must get the steak!

There is something about a simple menu that provides an almost unexpected amount of satisfaction. I highly recommend!

So let me start with saying - this was my first ever Michelin star restaurant, hence my expectations were a bit more elevated than usually.

Crown Shy suggests Prix-Fix menu only, for dinner, which is $72 per person and includes bread and hummus to share for the table, plus a choice of appetizer and entree - which is a pretty good deal for a Michelin star restaurant

The bread was delicious and so was the hummus (possibly the best I've ever tried!), for hummus they also brought some veggies to dip, I wish there was a bit more of them though, as we ran out quickly

For starters we chose Pear Salad and char crudo - they were good and quite unusual dishes, but nothing to write home about.

For entrees I went with branzino and my BF opted for short rib ($50 surcharge) which was amazing and he said it was the best short rib he's ever tasted! Was worth the extra money, and the portion was generous.

As it was our anniversary we got presented with two tiny cute cupcakes - thank you, Crown Shy!

The service was impeccable too.

The reason I took one star out is limited (imho) selection of sparking wines by the glass and the fact that my BF did not like his cocktail much (Cognac Crown).

Also, some reviewers mentioned that they left the restaurant hungry - definitely was NOT the case for us - we were literally rolling out from it

All in all, good restaurant that I would recommend visiting, but I don't see myself returning any time soon.

The bread and the warm hummus they give is 10/10

Appetizers were good but nothing I would come back for again (ordered the sweet potato and the crudo).

Main dishes were good but the overcharge is a bit overpriced. At $72 for the prix fixe menu the entree is roughly valued at $40 which is more than what I would pay for the chicken. We also ordered the short rib for an up charge of $50 which meant the total entree value was around $90 which I found steep. Yes the food is good but for the value I found this meal to be expensive.

The cocktail I ordered was about average and priced at $19.

We got the sorbet with marshmallow and the dessert was not good at all...the cookie tasted burnt and the sorbet was ok, but a bit too tart. The marshmallow was good and the only portion I enjoyed.

The service was good but the upcharge explanation was confusing.

My boyfriend and I returned to celebrate my birthday and I finally got to try the satsuma orange dessert. Yas. They're only offering a 3-Course Price Fixe at the moment, but don't worry, they're still serving all the classics. I tried:

+ Radicle cocktail - still amazing
+ Flightplan cocktail - loved this
+ RIP Aerlume cocktail - my BF enjoyed it
+ Hummus, 'Nduja, Crudités - great
+ Tomato, Peach, Meredith Feta - basically summer on a plate
+ Eggplant, Tahini, Yogurt - I LOVE TINY EGGPLANTS
+ Branzino, Cucumber, Avocado - great
+ Spaghetti, Sungold, Basil - great
+ Satsuma Orange, Honey, Toasted Marshmallow - one of the best desserts at Crown Shy and anywhere, really

5 thousand stars forever.

Returned for brunch and it was just as amazing. Easily got a reservation (but I imagine everyone will catch on soon). Don't miss the pastries to start - the Cinnamon bun with cream cheese was absolutely incredible. Also liked the Banana bread with creme fraiche and Maple doughnut with smoked pecan.

For the entrees, Biscuit with sausage gravy and soft scrambled eggs was excellent, and the Smoked salmon with potato Rosti was out of this world. 5 thousand stars forever.

Next time: I want to return for dinner soon, because there are a bunch more things I need to try (red snapper crudo, the creamsicle dessert).

Crown Shy has obviously been receiving reviews and hype up the wazoo, and while I usually give places much longer to get it together before trying them, in this case I was very much swayed by the photos of food. So my boyfriend and I did a weekday walk-in at around 6:20, and were seated at the bar about 10 minutes later.

I started with the Radicle cocktail, which was great. The complimentary pull apart bread was heavenly. Seriously, how is that stuff free? We then had the gruyere fritters, which were a little bit of a letdown - the pastry on the outside was only ok, not as delicious as it looked in the pics. Filling was amazing, though. Romaine was also great and stacked in such a way that defied physics.

For entrees, we just did pastas - the Caramelle was maybe my favorite thing that we ate, and the Cavatelli was awesome, too. Plus, we had the charred carrots. Carrots with clams was a first for me, but it really worked. Finally, sticky toffee pudding for dessert was excellent.

4.5 stars. I'd try the roasted short rib next time!

Amazing outdoor dinner on a Saturday night. Food, service, atmosphere. Everything is impeccable.  I got hummus, charred eggplant and branzino, while my husband got fritter, lettuce and chicken.

My favorite dish is branzino -  the skin is very crispy yet the meat remains tender. The sauce is the highlight: a bit spicy, umami, but not too overpowering. My husband's favorite is the gruyere fritters. They look like churros but tastes nothing like churros!

The vodka cocktails are also very delicious - strong enough, refreshing, yet not too sweet.

They also have limited short rib available for dinner. Next time I will definitely try that

This ambitious restaurant with a curious name is one of the few reasons I'd ever find myself in the FiDi neighborhood. I have yet to indulge myself in a meal at Eleven Madison Park, but dining at this first project from their former chef is as close as I'll get for now. Their outdoor setup on the sidewalk of a narrow, dimly lit street with lots of cars driving through is less than ideal, but it's great that this is even an option during this time when indoor dining is prohibited in NYC. I stole a longing glance at the dining room when I went inside the building to wash my hands, and marveled at the elegant light fixtures and the cool open kitchen format, thinking of the day I'd get to enjoy a meal inside. Until then, I appreciate that they're doing the best they can with the outdoor tables, which are carefully spaced out and they're playing great music to keep the ambience poppin' too.

Their menu is pared down to a 3 course prix fixe, with just a couple of options in each, so I'd study the menu beforehand to make sure everyone in your party will find something to suit their palate and dietary restrictions. For snacks, my dining companion and I enjoyed both the gruyere fritters and hummus with crudites. I felt that there weren't enough vegetables to eat with the very good hummus, but that's where the complimentary bread came in to fill the void. I now understand why people unanimously sing the praises of this complimentary bread, which is honestly one of the highlights of the meal, with its buttery, pull apart texture, tasty flecks of tapenade on top, and a rich, side of creme fraiche to enjoy it all with. The gruyere fritters are like a savory churro, filled with melty cheese and sprinkled with a chili lime seasoning that is so good, you'll stop balking at the $14 supplemental fee they charge you for ordering it.

The appetizer portion was possibly the best part of our meal, as the kitchen really let the seasonal vegetables in the dishes shine. The peach and tomato salad had several different types of tomatoes in it, each with its own flavor profile, ranging from juicy cherry tomatoes to sweet and fruity sungold tomatoes. The addition of mint, feta, and a tasty basil sauce created a bright, summery salad and really signaled to us that we were at a fine dining establishment that lived up to its reputation. They also understand the magical thing that happens to eggplant when it's charred, transforming the texture and flavor which gives it a deep, caramelized richness that would convert any eggplant naysayer into an eggplant superfan.

Entrees were similarly impressive despite their relative simplicity. Tender was a word we used to describe each of our dishes, which were the citrus-marinated chicken and the branzino with squash mole respectively, and though the portions seemed small, we were plenty full by the time dessert rolled around. My sweet tooth could not say no to the satsuma orange, honey ice cream with toasted marshmallow. I have no idea what a satsuma orange is but the flavor presented like a creamy sorbet, with crunchy pieces of honeycomb and was topped with a torched marshmallow that had the airy, whipped consistency of a dense whipped cream. We also had the Radicle and Flightplan cocktails, which appear to be a popular order and were expertly made, surprising no one.

Service was easy going and attentive. The only hiccup that occured during our meal is that the salad came out with almonds, which we explicitly stated would send my partner into anaphylactic shock if consumed. Definitely not ideal when our allergies were noted by the server and that we were assured our meal would be nut & almond free, but fortunately the almonds were really visible in the dish so we did not dig into what could've been a death trap.

Narrowly escaping a bad end to the night aside, our meal was a memorable one. Definitely beats any meal I can slap together at home.

The food here is delicious. We had dinner here for our anniversary. Everything from the bread we had before the meal to the chocolate dessert was delicious. There was a bit of a delay getting our main course but the waitress was very nice about it and they gave us a complimentary dessert because of it. I loved the olive oil bread, the hummus, and the pear salad, and the branzino. The chocolate dessert with stracciatella ice cream was great.

Honestly the worst experience at a Michelin restaurant at NYC. Both the salad and the bread came with a bug, which was disgusting and made us lose appetite. Such experience never happened at any other Michelin restaurants that I have gone before.
The short rib is good. We ordered three desserts and the pudding is the best.
The service here is just ok. Could get better service and food with the same price at other restaurant.

I've been wanting to come here for a while. My partner and I arrived on a Saturday night, we were 20 mins late than our reservation time. Luckily, we still got seated right away. The restaurant is packed, so don't forget to make a reservation in advance.

I love the decor in Crown Shy, it's very minimalist and classy. There's a bar area, an open kitchen and a bigger dining area. They play hip pop music in the background. It has a pretty casual vibe. I think it's great spot for a girls/bro night or a date night.

Now let's talk about food, the complementary bread is real good. Can't stop eating it. We ordered the romaine salad which is one of the highly recommended dish. I will not order it again, because I don't wanna pay $17 for three pieces of romaine anymore. It doesn't taste bad or anything, it's very fresh, but it's not satisfying at all. We got the Gruyere Fritter, I enjoyed it, it's kinda sour and spicy. We both liked the short ribs a lot, you should definitely give it a try. For dessert, we got the cream puffs, it's delicious.

I ordered No Mas (non- alcoholic) for drink, if you like citrusy drinks, you will enjoy this.

We will definitely go back and try more dishes.

We had a 3 course meal for lunch here on a Monday, and this place served the best chicken I have had in my life!

When I first arrived, I was waiting for the rest of the party, so they seated me at the bar, where I got to chat with the friendly bartenders about absinthe. Turns out they offered Pernod Absinthe Superieure under spirits on the alcohol menu, which I was quite giddy about, so when we all ordered alcohol, that was the drink I ordered.

We chose to dine from the 3-course Pix Fixe, and this was what I ordered:

Appetizer: Fluke Crudo, Citrus, Sesame Tuile
Wonderful appetizer. I love fish, and it was quite refreshing, kind of like sashimi covered in a thin crust of sesame.

Entree: Grilled Citrus-Marinated Chicken, Hot Sauce
An additional $10, but it was so worth it. I swear, this was the best chicken I have ever had in my life! It was a hit with my entire party. It was perfectly grilled, juicy, with the best flavors that are spiced just right and the right texture for the chicken! Meat was tender and plump, and the skin perfectly crisp without feeling oily and fatty. BEST CHICKEN EVER.

Dessert: Apple sorbet, Sticky Toffee Pudding, Pecans
It was delicious! It was a small, decadent treat that was like a fancy version of apple pie.
The party ordered one of each dessert on the menu, so I also sampled the Satsuma Orange Ice Cream with Honey and Toasted Marshmallow, and the Roasted Banana Ice Cream, Caramel, Peanut Butter. They were all wonderful!

We really enjoyed our lunch here on a Monday afternoon. Fantastic first meal outing for this New York trip!

Enjoying brunch in the Financial district named Crown Shy. It's a super modern look inside with a very beautiful bar layout.

I came here with three girlfriends and shared all the plates to try different items. We ordered the lox plate which had some tasty crisp potatoes. I also ordered the chicken sausage and a side of potatoes that were different types of potatoes. These were small and pretty filling. For dessert, we choose to order the sample of bread and you get to pick three varieties of it. Overall each bread was nice and tasty but my favorite has to be the banana bread.

It was a pretty fun brunch and pretty tasty. Everything was delicious and even though it was super busy the service was good. I would want to come back and try more things on their brunch menu. But also I would want to come back and try dinner options!

My only regret about my meal at Crown Shy is that we didn't order more food. I was able to get a prime time reservation here during Christmas week, and was so glad I did - one of the best dining experiences I had during the year. Crown Shy is classy and slightly fancy (the bathrooms have Le Labo products), but not pretentious. You won't look out of place in jeans and sneakers here, provided they are cute. I agree with other reviewers that the service is at a slower pace than the pedigree of this restaurant might suggest, but I didn't mind that.

We got the gruyere fritters, the hummus, carrots in clam broth, and of course the free pull apart olive bread. The bread is truly one of the best things about this restaurant, especially considering that other restaurants are charging $6 for some torn up multigrain and a chunk of salted butter. Everything that Crown Shy does goes above and beyond the norm, and that goes for the free bread as well.

The menu here is not overly descriptive (i.e., you're not really sure what the thing you ordered is going to look/taste like), which can go terribly wrong at some places, but is always a very pleasant surprise at Crown Shy. Really delicious and creative small plates, where the pairing of ingredients and textures genuinely works and isn't just thrown together for shock value. For dessert we had the roasted banana ice cream, which unsurprisingly was amazing. Can't wait to come back and try the other two thirds of the menu.

I had been excited to try Crown Shy after having read numerous glowing reviews of this new restaurant. Unfortunately, I was surprised that the experience did not reflect what I had heard and read. The restaurant itself is beautiful with high ceilings, a nice bar at front, and a minimal, but comfortable feel. The wait staff is absolutely lovely, kind, and attentive.

The real disappointment was the food. We ordered the charred carrots with razor clams and thyme (at the recommendation of the waiter) and the charred octopus with red rice and sausage. The carrots were pretty tasteless as well as the accompanying clams. The charred octopus was over-cooked and difficult to eat as well as lacking flavor. We had planned to order dessert, but were so underwhelmed by our meal, decided to forgo it. While Crown Shy is a lovely dining experience, the surprisingly poor quality and taste of the food would not make me want to return.

While the service and drinks at Crown Shy were excellent, the vegetarian food was...not bad but also not quite as good as I expected it to be.

I started my evening with a mocktail - a No Mas. It tasted good: Citrucy and tart, but I didn't quite taste the rose that they described as being in the drink.

As expected of a restaurant with a Michelin star, the place setting, as well as its individual components were impeccable. I particularly loved the glassware they use.

The service was also mostly impeccable. I particularly appreciated that from the moment my server approached the table, she knew and understood my dietary restrictions that I had listed on my reservation. (I went as a party of one). I felt well taken-care of. The only thing that I noticed was that when I ordered my appetizer and entree, I felt like the server tried two or three times to suggest that I get a salad as well, even though I mentioned that I was only "medium hungry." That said, I understand that this is a common practice among restaurants. The service was otherwise impeccable.

I really enjoyed the olive pull-apart bread they served at the beginning. It was soft, fluffy, and perfectly seasoned, with bits of olive paste between some of the layers. The outside of the bread was a bit oily (in a good way, not overly so), so I appreciated that they served it with a smooth, creamy labne instead of butter (which would have been too much grease). I could eat this bread all day.

As my appetizer, I ordered the gruyere fritters. It was a large portion that seemed to be designed for a party of two or three. The presentation was ok, but the fritters themselves were underwhelming. It was mostly a doughy mini-churro with a bit of gruyere sauce inside, which squirted out when you tried to cut it with a fork and knife. It tasted average, like something I could get at a concession stand or a food truck.

Perhaps the server noticed my reaction to the gruyere fritters, because the bar sent over a complimentary drink. It was a mango soda with mint and togarashi (Japanese spice). It was sweet with a bit of a kick and I really liked it (more than the No Mas).

My main course was the Lasagnetti with smoked mozzarella. The pasta itself felt a bit dry. The bechamel sauce it was on top of had an uneven consistency. The endive salad on top was good, but the chestnut garnish was too hard to chew. All together, the smoky flavor was too strong and felt like it overpowered whatever other flavors I was supposed to taste. Moreover, the texture was odd - too chewy because of the dry pasta, and the dry hardness (not a crunch) of the chestnuts was incompatible with the rest of the dish.

At the very end, I ordered the Sauternes dessert wine. Hats off to the sommelier because it was excellent - sweet and floral with a delicate flavor profile.

For my birthday, they brought out a cupcake with a candle for me (but thankfully didn't sing happy birthday, which I appreciated). The cupcake was delicious and may have even been my favorite part of the meal. The chocolate cake base was perfectly moist and just the right level of sweetness. You could taste the high quality of the chocolate it was made with. I'm not typically a fan of icing on cake, but the icing on the cupcake was delightfully surprising. It was a mix of two separate flavors swirled together. Each of the flavors harmonized perfectly with the other. The first flavor was chocolate and the other was some kind of custardy/fruity (but not too fruity) flavor. I really enjoyed the cupcake.

My bill arrived in a timely manner but I was encouraged to take my time to finish my wine and cupcake.

I also appreciated how I was able to pack the food I wasn't able to finish, and it was waiting for me at coat check at the end of my meal.

Overall, the meal was not bad, but the quality seemed to vary greatly between the dishes.

I mean this place nails it. Finally a restaurant in FiDi worthy of a Michelin, at reasonable prices, in a setting that is family-friendly, world class, chic, all in one. The restaurant is located in a condo? building, but there are signs on the outside describing how to get in. Once there you are greeted by friendly staff on the outside, who help you navigate your way.

Some hits: cocktails, the donuts and pastries at brunch, the octopus at dinner.

Also, this place has some amazing restrooms...

This place is the restaurant child from the former chef of NoMad and the former manager of Del Posto, both one star Michelin spots in their own right, so it's no surprise that a a Michelin Star would grace this establishment.

Loves:
+ Food is good. For two people we split: gruyere fritters, white bean hummus + bread, chicken, a pasta dish, and the setsuma orange ice cream. It was enough!
+ Fritters are a must but I was pleasantly surprised with how impressive the chicken tasted. So juicy and yum... it honestly puts so much of the chicken I've had in my life to shame.
+ Very friendly staff.
+ Nice cocktails.
+ Received a delicious chocolate cupcake since it was my birthday.
+ Classy and clean space.

If I have to nitpick at things I can't say I love this being in a business building, but helloOOoo! we are in FiDi. Also this is not a budget meal but it is Michelin rated so there you go.

Overall yes, I'd gladly come back. :)

I was very excited to land a reservation at Crown Shy, but was extremely disappointed. Especially for a Michelin Star restaurant.

The only option is a 3-course price fix menu for $68 per person. Not too bad for NYC, but the portions were EXTREMELY small. The "snack" and "appetizer" were very tiny, but I guess that's to be expected. However, I ordered the chicken for my entree, and was disappointed to be served half of a small chicken breast (photo attached).

The most disappointing part about the entire dining experience was the service. I understand times are tough for restaurants during COVID, but service is the one thing that's in your control. Our service was extremely slow. We sat down at 8:30pm, and didn't leave until 11:00pm. Keep in mind, this was only a 3 course dinner with extremely small portions. We could have easily been finished in an hour if we were actually being attended to.

The only enjoyable part of dinner was the cocktails. The Watermelon Negroni was amazing!

Overall, the service was slow, drinks were great, and the food was just okay...but not Michelin Star quality, and definitely not worth the price.

From the time I got seated to the time I finished my dinner, I had a wonderful experience eating here.

They have enough staff to take care if you quickly.  And the food was phenomenal!

They started off giving me a delicately soft small loaf with spices inside served with labne.

I started with oysters with cucumber gelee.  That is cucumber in jello cut thinly in little bits on top of fresh oysters on rice with a small miso leaf for decor and flavor.

Second, I ordered the Romaine salad leaves brushed with homemade green goddess dressing with toasted bread crumbs between the layered leaves.

Third, I tried the Caramel Morel Chèvre.  I could smell the aroma of the motel when they served it.  The pasta was shaped like candy stuffed with chèvre inside and served with buttery tasting sauce that tasted very French.  One of my favorites

I had to try the chicken they brined for 36 hours they demonstrated on TV.  It was spicy with slices of Jalapeños and spicy sauce on the side.

The dessert was the best part!  I had both the sticky toffee pudding and satsuma orange ice cream.  Both were exact.  The Satsuma orange ice cream reminds me of Baked Alaska with crispy honey comb toffee.  The toffee pudding had caramel sauce and plenty of toasted pecans served with green apple sorbet or was it ice cream?   And delicious cream that is not sweet.

Another day:
Yesterday,  we went here to have Sunday brunch.  The menu is different on Sunday brunch.

I had to try their  bacon and nut donuts which I highly recommend.  It is a yeast donut with homemade
Chantilly type cream in the center.

I had their home made bread French toast with chantilly cream as well.  Their coffee is unlimited if black (maybe if you had with milk too).

My friends had the steak breakfast with a salad and couscous.  That looked delicious as well.  But the shrimp salad looks too simple.  They also only served halves of shrimp. It is a restaurant I could go to a lot of times.  Excellent and cannot go wrong with any order  n you make.

So, this was one of my favorite new restaurants.  I've left a review before but this is a during Covid - post lockdown review.  The protocols in place are AMAZING.  They have an outdoors now.  The tables inside are super spread apart.  They do temp checks and collect contact information for tracing.  You scan the QR code for the menu.  They ask that everyone wear a mask when a server is coming to the table or you are getting up.  They had silverware packed separately in packs - so no one had to touch anything AND hand sanitizer at every table!   So BRAVO for all of that.
Omar was our server and we ADORED him! It is a
Pre-fix menu which we don't love - but we LOVE Crown Shy and it was my bday - so I wanted to go
to one of my favorite spots.  Really, if the food is so incredible, does is matter that it is price fixed? Hell no!
Cocktails are INCREDIBLE! Food is MELT IN YOUR MOUTH.  Between the 4 of us we ordered every item on the menu and shared.
So impressed with precautions they have taken.

Extremely yummy brunch at Crown Shy! I went with a party of 4 at 1 pm with a reservation. Once our whole party arrived, we were seated immediately. The restaurant has a beautiful ambience - it is spacious and full of light. Service was good - our waitress was attentive and especially accommodating towards dietary restrictions.

The food was great - I got the short rib sandwich. The sandwich was great and had lots of layers of flavor with the tomato compote. The side potatoes were very yummy and had a nice crunch to them.

Overall, great meal and experience. Will definitely be back for dinner!

We had another amazing dinner here. This time (again with a group of four), we got (in rough order of preference):

Grilled chicken
Gruyere fritters
Cappellacci with sweet potato
----
White bean hummus
Fluke crudo
Charred octopus
----
Short rib
Lasagnette
Grilled pear salad
Charred carrots

The chicken was the biggest surprise, since grilled chicken (or really any kind of non-fried chicken) is usually so boring. This one was incredible though, and I'd have a hard time coming here and not getting it again.

One thing I thought last time and definitely feel after this last visit is that the short rib is overkill. It's great (everything here is great, even the dishes on the third tier above), but it's by far the most expensive dish on the menu, and you could get so much bang for your buck by replacing that with 2-3 other dishes.

Even after all of the above, we still managed to finish with three desserts: the chocolate tart, the satsuma orange ice cream, and the roasted banana ice cream. I'd probably skip the banana next time, but the other two were really great.

This was outstanding. We went with a group of four and got the following (in rough order of my preference):

- Gruyere fritters
- Octopus
----
- Short rib
- Hummus
- Cavatelli
----
- Caramelle
- Chicories salad

The only two that I'd say aren't must-reorders or close to it are the bottom two -- all the rest were really amazing, as was the complementary pull-apart olive bread that you start with. (Starting with that, followed by the gruyere fritters and then the incredible bread you get with the hummus, we were basically in carb heaven before we even saw any of the pastas.)

The prices are also surprisingly reasonable for this kind of place, and the price/volume ratio was really solid for everything but the short rib, which made up for the lack of volume by being incredible. I will say, though, I could easily see coming here and replacing that with two or three other dishes, since there's so much on the menu to try.

We finished with the chocolate tart and two ice creams: milk chocolate and roasted banana. I'm not huge on banana ice cream, but the other two were amazing, especially the crumble on top of the chocolate ice cream.

Overall, feels like this will almost certainly be on the best-new-restaurants-in-NYC-2019 lists, and we will certainly be back.

What a huge letdown. I didn't even have high hopes for it to begin with because the only reason my husband and I ate there was because it's in the same building as our hotel. We also didn't realize it was a prix-fix menu only until after we were seated.
We begrudgingly went for it both having the bread, hummus, pear salad and chicken. Cocktail wise we both ordered the coconut something?
I'll admit, the bread was fantastic. The chicken wasn't noteworthy, was a teeny tiny portion (literally HALF a chicken breast!!!), and honestly dry. Everything else was just not up to par for the hefty price tag. Both our salads and dishes of hummus were left nearly untouched by both my husband and I for not liking the flavor. Our cocktails were refreshing, but no more so than a coconut flavored seltzer water is considered. At $19 I'd expect more than an extremely weak drink that was mostly ice.
Service was also **seriously** lacking for a star rated restaurant. Our dishes were left on our table without being cleared despite it becoming clearly overcrowded with ones we were finished with and our water was also not refilled. There seemed to be plenty of staff present yet alas they didn't seem to care and were difficult to actually wave down dispite the place being surprisingly dead.
Immediately after leaving my husband and I went across the street to the poke place because we were still starving. The simple fact of even needing a second dinner IMMEDIATELY after dropping a couple hundred is insane.
Never again.
I am dumbfounded how this place has such amazing reviews. This was also not my first visit to a Michelin Star rated restaurant. I've been to plenty and know the deal. This place is simply just so undeserving given our entire experience.

Wonderful service. Great dirty martini. But in a coupe as opposed to martini glass. White bean hummus was great. Short ribs was pretty good. Not sure it was worth the upcharge. Bronzino was okay. Could do w more taste. Pricey. $320 for two.

Ambience: 4.5/5
Service: 5/5
Food: 4/5

Cautious to give a 5... I truly LOVED 2-3 dishes, and found 2 to be just ok. Classic date night material, elevated with some very interesting dishes. I couldn't say exactly what kind of cuisine Crown Shy might be, but take a look at the menu and you'll see you get a bit from all over.

Walk through a very grand entrance into a more casually sophisticated candlelit dining room. The food matches the setting: kinda classic, kinda modern, kinda cool.

White bean hummus with (very good) puffed bread (4.5/5) was a beautiful little series of plates, perhaps just a bit too little, but all very tasty. The puffed bread is super thin and delightful - saves you stomach room for later.

Charred carrots with razor clams (5/5) is a MUST order! The foam of cauliflower/parsnips is really luxurious, hiding little juicy razor clams, and I could drink a bowl of that.

Octopus (4/5) was good but not amazing, mostly because it was too salty and some of the bean mixture was unpleasantly al dente.

The Chicken (4/5) has been a star in a lot of reviews, but I thought it was okay. Tasty but relies a lot on the hot sauce and fresh vegetables on top. I was slightly jealous of our neighbors eating the short ribs.

Please, PLEASE leave room for dessert! The Satsuma orange ice cream (5/5) was incredibly tasty, and it's actually more of a sundae with marshmallow and pieces of honeycomb brittle. The cheesecake (5/5) definitely would be a nice choice as well, only I wish I had more!

Overall, I'm excited to return and try more food here - it really all sounds so interesting and delicious. The host was a little cold, but once inside we were well taken care of.

Wow. This place really brings it.

The menu is distilled down to the best hits and boy are they delicious. Our party of 4 ordered about 2/3rds of the dishes and everything was a stunner. The chefs even managed to hit it out of the park with a dish based off of a carrot.

What's equally amazing is the world-class bar menu seasonally crafted by Mr. Lind. It goes well beyond what you will get at a typical establishment of this caliber in NY. Its obvious the team is led by seasoned pros with some serious hospitality fire power.

Oh and on top of that, the service on bar and dining room is impeccable: attentive, perfectly timed and put us at ease to just enjoy a great 3-hour meal which felt like it passed in an instant.

I can't wait to go back.

I was very happy to see that Crown Shy earned a Michelin star this year because it is very, very well-deserved. I had dinner here on the Fourth of July - because that was one of the only days that had open dinner reservations at reasonable hours (the NY Times and NY Magazine review had *both* come out in June).

The entrance is kind of hidden - 70 Pine is a residential building and you have to walk inside the building to get to the restaurant. And in spite of the word "Crown" in its name, the restaurant is not located on the top floor as you might expect, but on the ground floor. Apparently, "Crown Shy" refers a phenomenon where the tops, or crowns, of trees don't touch each other, thereby forming a canopy filled with gaps. Contrary to what Pete Wells might think, I think the name is pretty clever and refreshing.

Now on to the important stuff - the food. It is absolutely delicious. We ordered: the red snapper crudo, gruyere fritters (which are more churro than fritter), white bean hummus with puffed bread, tagliatelle and grilled citrus-marinated chicken. While everything was good, the crudo, hummus and chicken were the real showcases of what Crown Shy can deliver.

I am particularly partial to crudo, but damn, the crudo here was phenomenal. The brightness of the citrus and the crunch of the sesame tuile maade for such an interesting and fantastic marriage of flavor and texture on the palate, I honestly would have been happy just to eat crudo for my entire meal.

The star of the hummus appetizer is not the hummus but the puffed bread. It's a really creative way to serve a bread course - it caters to the aesthetics of the Instagram crowd (I, of course, could not resist snapping a quick shot before digging in) but also doesn't disappoint in taste. There's a lot of butter or oil in it, as all good bread should have, and the softness and porousness of it is just made for soaking up dips and sauces like the hummus and the leftover citrus in my crudo.

As for the chicken, I almost never order chicken at restaurants but having read various reviews that rave about the chicken here, I just had to try. It's a whole chicken leg, with fingers and all, served with a few leaves of romaine, pickled vegetables and a hot sauce puree that was delightfully but not overwhelmingly spicy. The chicken itself is cooked expertly with an even amount of juiciness throughout.

For a Michelin star restaurant, the prices are decent - expect to pay around $150 for two with appetizers and drinks. I've certainly eaten at more expensive places with much less impressive food.

Wow this place got it. Under one year since it's been open and it has already recieved a Michelin Star. I been meaning to go since they first opened when I heard the executive chef of Nomad, James Kent, and one of the chefs from Eleven Madison are behind this new restaurant. However Crownshy is definitely the more casual and less stuffy sister than Eleven Madison with just about the same great food and fantastically in the affordable price range! The ambiance is playing top40s music of your pop & hip hop among the high ceilings.

My server was great at knowing exactly what to recommend from their menu. The free complimentary homemade bread was already a great start, absolutely bomb and addicting. Between my date and I, we started off with the gruyere fritters which were like amazing cheese churros. The fluke crudo was amazing, perfectly dressed and maybe the best fluke crudo I've had. The glazed farro with bone marrow and oxtail was also another favorite dish and we also had their known grilled chicken entree dish for main course. It was a very juicy chicken indeed though very spicy & citrus marinated. Even their desserts are fantastic. I also really enjoyed their cocktails too.

I definitely can't wait to come back already to bring my family! I think it's actually perfect if you come with four people since it's shareable and you can try more off the menu. The dishes are delicious and well executed all together. The price is very reasonable for the quality, service and dining experience you get. Highly recommend!!

Went to the Crown Shy for a holiday team lunch. Restaurant is located in a building which is easy to miss. We were seated immediately, it was pretty busy for a Wednesday afternoon. Waiter didn't come by for a while but we were greeted by a pushy sommelier (assuming that's what she was because she kept insisting on us buying a bottle of wine tho we preferred cocktails) The lunch menu is pre-fix $45pp, It must change frequently because I couldn't find any pics of the current selections

Food:
For starter I had the crudo, it was citrusy and delicious!
My colleges had the chicories which was pretty much a bowl of radish, nothing special
Entrees- I ordered the short rib sandwich, it was good but was more bread than short rib, I removed the top bun. The chicken is what everyone raves about, my coworker ordered this. It was good and tasty but nothing to write home about, not worth the hype! And it comes with the foot attached!!! The blue crab roll was also good but small, it's like a lobster roll, not a sushi roll.
All of the dessert choices were yummy, we each ordered a different one and tried them all!

Overall everything was pretty good, the lunch portions are pretty small tho, you won't leave stuffed or even full depending on what you order. Chicken was the biggest selection

Came for lunch. Food taste great, but it was definitely overpriced imo. I'd say mid 30s would be more appropriate.

The prix fix lunch comes with 3 courses (for $45). I selected:
-snapper appetizer. This was pretty tasty. Fish was fresh and the combination of flavors worked well
-short rib sandwich was really good. Short rib was cooked well. There were many different ingredients... I couldn't even tell what was included but it was delicious.
-as other reviews have stated, desert is served in a to go cup. We were able to still eat it in the restaurant. Got the blueberry sorbet, which was fine, but nothing special

I won't be back for lunch. May return to try out dinner though

Came here for a birthday dinner and am absolutely glad I did.
Victor served us and recommended how to plan our meal for the night. We started off with some cocktails and gruyere fritters. The cocktails here were amazing and would come back for them alone.
The carrots with razor clams were delicious and I understand why people order them.
I especially loved the octopus with chorizo.
The chicken was so juicy, highly recommend it.
For dessert, we got the sticky toffee pudding. It's the best dessert I've ever had.

I came here on a Wednesday evening. The ambiance is modern and elegant while being understated in a sense.

We started out with the Caramelle ($17), complimentary pull apart bread, hummus ($12), and gruyere fritters ($13).

The complimentary bread was soft and warm, I really enjoyed it. However, the dip that came with it, tasted like sour cream sort of and it wasn't my favorite.

The gruyere fritters sort of just tasted like cheese churros more or less. I did not find the type of cheese to be particularly palatable.

I really liked the hummus. It was a large portion and it paired well with the complimentary bread as well.

The 'nduja puffed bread was really the same as an Indian poori to me in terms of taste and texture. I really do love pooris though so I thoroughly enjoyed this bread.

I sort of felt it was problematic though slightly that the restaurant calls itself "American New" but it has Mediterranean hummus, Indian bread, Mexican churros as reference points but then it doesn't acknowledge those references with its names and titles.

The caramelle ($17) was light and yet creamy at the same time which is hard to achieve I feel. The corn in the dish was very salient in the flavor palette, which was unique but I'm not sure if I loved it or felt it was too pungent.

I also had the short rib ($59), meant to be shared by two people. I really think this was a winning dish. I loved that it came with quinoa, as well as multiple dipping sauces such as chimichurri. The braised ends made in horseradish and with potatoes was creamy and delectable. It was one of my favorite aspects of the dinner overall.

As dessert, I tried the Satsuma Orange ice cream with honeycomb and marshmallow. I have to say it was a beautiful dessert experience. I'm usually not even an orange flavored person but the tartness of the orange juxtaposed with the sweetness of the honeycomb and the warm and toasted marshmallow was really special. There was also a crunchy consistency to it with the honeycomb added which I liked. The whole dessert was very nuanced with its combination of pairings. My friend actually commented that she felt the desert menu was more creative than the dinner menu which I felt was an interesting comment.

One minor negative aspect for me was I asked for a coke without ice. It was given to me in a short glass, which was filled only 2/3 or 3/4 of the way. It just felt a bit stingy on their end, as basically they charged $5 for 6 ounces of coke.

The bathroom was European in its style and it allowed for more privacy than usual.

Overall, I really enjoyed my experience dining here and felt it had specific highlights in terms of certain dishes really shining.

Overall, I'd give a 4.5/5 to Crown Shy after having a super lovely experience celebrating my birthday here with my fiance! Normally, I have no reason to go all the way down to FiDi, but we had errands to run so I decided it was the perfect time to give this much-hyped place a try. Reservations were very easy to get - there weren't any available online, but we called a day ahead and were able to get an early Thursday dinner table.

The vibe of the place is super cool, e.g. Le Labo soap, APC-style staff uniforms, and a jazzy/hip-hop/chill playlist. Service is attentive but not fussy or formal. The menu, like the decor, is quite minimalist. Wine by the glass had just a few options per category, but I fairly enjoyed my Cabernet Sauvignon from Bordeaux. Restaurants of a similar price point can get away with charging for bread service, but Crown Shy's free (!) lemony, olive-stuffed pull-apart bread is some of the best free bread in the city, and comes with an addicting labneh spread. Couldn't help but get seconds of this.

As for food, the two of us shared two appetizers (red snapper crudo, charred carrots), the short rib for two, as well as the sticky toffee pudding for dessert. The crudo was good, although if it weren't for my current no-cheese policy (wedding diet), I definitely would've opted for the caramelle pasta dish instead. The charred carrots, which came with a foamy, clam chowder-like sauce-broth and razor clams, was also pretty good but again, I would probably try something different next time.

The real winner was the short rib, which cut like butter and melted in my mouth like a wagyu brisket. The accompanying chimichurri perfectly balanced each fatty bite. The side of burnt ends hidden under a silky layer of horseradish mashed potato was also amazing, and I would've ordered it as a standalone dish! The other side, a grains salad, paled in comparison with the rest of the dish, but the bites with sweet corn and fresh tomato were still a delightful, clean contrast to the richness of the meat. Do NOT skip on this dish.

As for dessert, the sticky toffee pudding was delicious, and so was the apple sorbet that came with it. They tasted better separately than together (the thickness of the toffee sauce is maybe too much versus light sorbet). Because it was my birthday, the staff also surprised us with a giant cupcake with a candle and adorably tiny crown. We had no room for the cupcake, so we packed it to go, and that became a delicious dessert for the following night!

Crown shy was amazing. You can't go wrong. If you have a large party make a reservation. If you have two of you they accept walk ins but you'll have to sit at the bar. Which is a great experience. The bar staff is so nice and lovely. Getting to know them was part of my experience. The food was so good everything we ate was explained to us and it was all Amazing. And most of the time you don't get dessert but you have to at the crown shy. The steak was to die for it's kind of pricey but so worth it. Loved will get stopping by again.

I have been waiting to try this place ever since I read the review from the New York Times. I have to say the service was impeccable.  The food came out in a timely manner and we really enjoyed all of the courses. I have to say, you have to try the short ribs. The other dishes we also had were on point but I'm pretty sure the menu is seasonal, so check it out and see what you think sounds best!!
I'm just going to have to warn you, I felt like the octopus was over cooked. I wouldn't order it again unfortunately.

I'm not sure why this place received two stars from the NY Times.

Let's start with the critically acclaimed Gruyere Fritters. Essentially, it's a single churro that's cut up and filled with a cheese sauce. These were terrible. First of all, the churro lacked flavor. Secondly, the cheese filling tasted nothing like gruyere cheese. Finally, for $14, I would have preferred to go to Costco for their $1 churro.

Other less-than-desirable items include the following:
White Bean Hummus and Grilled Bread - hummus was fine but the bread had the texture of a cracker. It was probably baked/grilled too long.

Charred Octopus, Red Rice, Morcilla Sausage - the octopus was nice but the rice was bland and hard. I'm not sure where the sausage was.

Grilled Citrus Chicken, Hot Sauce - the chicken was indeed citrusy but wasn't anything mind blowing. Hot sauce? We didn't see or taste any. What was really odd was the plating: the chicken was set to the side of the plate, so it looked like the chefs forgot to put something else on the side. Fail.

Short Rib, Braised ends, Sunchokes, Chimichurri - next to the fritter, this was the worst dish. It's probably because it was $71. Seventy-one dollars! Unbelievable. That comes out to about $6 per beef slice. What a rip-off. As for taste, there was nothing worth mentioning. It was just soft beef. Chimichurri? My friend makes a better sauce. Braised ends? It was in a small cup with some strange foam. Sunchokes? That was the highlight of the dish.

In conclusion, I would not recommend this place.
