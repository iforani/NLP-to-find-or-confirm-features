Montero's is the coolest place you'll ever have the privilege of drinking and celebrating in. There is no "it" scene here or fancy flair cocktails. It's an ancient dive bar that should be a museum to honor the New York of old that disappears faster than you can snap your fingers each day.

My most recent visit was an early Friday evening after work (teacher hours mind you), and it felt like all regulars in the spot. Pool table was busy, early evening news was on, jukebox was loaded up with some jams, and the owner (?) as usual posted up at the end of the bar surveying his keep.

Though it wasn't crowded, for our eventually large party of about 6+, it was difficult to be seated and not feel in the way of all traffic cause the place is so narrow. That may have been a blemish for my coworkers, but I've been here on karaoke nights when it was standing room only, so my standard of measurement is skewed.

Perhaps this may not be our regular after work spot cause our group rolls too large, but I will be back with my crew for Karaoke one of these evenings!

And for the early couple of first round drinks with 2-3 coworkers tops? Montero's works juuuust fine, and we should be so lucky to get to experience it.

Montero's! Karaoke with AMETHYST (lovely host with killer vocals). Need I say more.

A friend of ours was having a birthday and we had to trek it do some hidden bar in Brooklyn Heights. My friend described this place as "aquatic themed" and a "dive". Two of my favorite words when combined together. I salivate at the thought of an old man bar and then you put karaoke in the mix  like the cherry on top.

We arrived around 9pm. Turns out this was the smartest move. Later I saw groups of people and even birthday people get turned away by the charming door guy "Pepe" while "Matthew" tried to woo me.

The karaoke is done in the tiniest part of the bar. I suggest you'd stand in an angle to let people go to the bathroom but also leave room for "Sonya" to bus tables and get to the bar and still see the karaoke list.

Back to Amethyst. You gotta write down the song you want to sing. If it's not in the computer then Amethyst will call you back to put in a new song. You get a song with every drink you order. If you are doing a duet then you hand the mic to the person who's being invited to sing. This is the rule. The name on the slip is the person that hands the mic.  Don't forget. The main mic has the red tape. DON'T PUT DRINKS DOWN ON AMETHYST'S TABLE.

At the bar, Kaddy is slinging drinks but will take a quick break to sing some Alanis Morisette. Everyone here is down for the wild ride!

The beers are $4 for pbr and with a tequila shot it's $11. So pick your liquid courage wisely.

This place is over 80 years old. The staff was really the best part, followed by the decor. The crowd is a young, finance, fresh out of grad school types and some older regulars sprinkled in. Maybe they come on the non-karaoke nights.

It's CASH ONLY. Almost $3 for the ATM.

First karaoke bar I've been to, and it was so much fun! You buy a drink, and you receive a ticket to write your name and the song you want to sing. The crowd was super encouraging, cheering everyone on as they belted their hearts out. A little bit of an older crowd. Wish I had stayed for a few more rounds.

Montero's is a dive that comes fully equipped with a pool table, surly bartenders and surprisingly fun karaoke nights, so please allow me to sing this review to you in the style of Bohemian Rhapsody:

Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a dive bar, to escape from reality.
Open your beer, look at that weird guy, smell peeeee...
I'm just a poor boy, I need some buybacks please.*
Because I'm kinda drunk, OK sloshed. Little high? Maybe so.
Anything the 'tender pours, doesn't really matter to me, to me...

Oh man, just sang a song.
Put my mouth up on the mic, yelled my chorus, now they left.
To think, the night had just begun.
But now I've gone and chased them all away...
My bad, ooh, didn't mean to make you leave,
If I'm here back again this time tomorrow,
Get me help, the AA kind, 'cause I definitely have a problem.

Too late, my drink has come.
Sent shots all down my throat, think I should've got my coat.
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go.
Gotta leave you all behind and eat some food,**
Really, ooh, (anything that tastes good)
I don't want to leave,
But sometimes I wish I'd never come in at all.

[Guitar solo fades out because I think this has run its course.]
_____________

*The prices are definitely a little higher than they should be, considering the smell and the man sleeping in the corner that you might think is homeless, but is actually just waiting for karaoke to start (he has a lovely voice).
**They don't serve any, but Table 87 is quite close and delicious.

Montero's is a neighborhood staple. It's as old school as it gets - like something out of Last Exit to Brooklyn.

Come here for the karaoke machine, stay for the cheap beers.

Cash only!

Oh, and if you and your bros decide to sing Wagon Wheel, I'm going to throw something at you.

We ended up here on just another Friday night, after finding out they had good karaoke. Not knowing anyone around, we ended up having a good time and talking with some pretty great people! Karaoke was a blast and the KJ was great. She made sure to keep everyone in the order they were submitted, even when one of the girls trying to sing gave her crap about it. The one thing I like least about karaoke is people trying to drunkenly get their stuff in before their turn, and the KJ handled it like a pro.

Low-key dive bar that has provided some great times and late nights for my coworker and I. Karaoke on deck around 9:30 and there's a pool table in the back as well. Friendly service and good drinks. Cash only.

Solid dive bar and I wouldn't have enjoyed it half as much if it weren't for the karaoke in the back. Shots are $6 or $9 depending on which bartender you ask... the well whiskey switched from Evan Williams to Old Overholt and I kind of lost track of what they were pouring me.

Like most dive bars, it's pretty mixed crowd, the bartenders aren't very nice, and the decorations are tacky as sin. But I had a great time for a reasonable price.

What an EXCELLENT dive bar! I had a fabulous time here Saturday night. Montero - what I hear is possibly the oldest bar in Brooklyn - is small, cozy, and decked out in nautical trinkets and memorabilia. The staff are friendly, and they have a good (but standard) selection of drafts and bottled beers. But what really makes this place stand out from the pack is its vibe and LIT karaoke night. The minute you walk in, the staff and clientele make you feel like you're part of the family. And the karaoke, run singlehandedly by one person, was so much fun. You know the deal: get a sheet from the bar with your drink, write down your name and the song, give it to the DJ, and wait. The mics work great, and I was pleasantly surprised to hear many good singers cover everything from Creed to Lauryn Hill.

All in all, Montero is a blast and will likely be a Brooklyn Heights landmark for years to come.

Montero's is a real, authentic old school dive bar. Not one of these newfangled spots appropriating dive bar culture, but the real deal.

It's been around forever, so if you live in the area, I'm likely not breaking news of its existence. But for those who live outside of the neighborhood who want to add a new sticky-floored dive to their rotation, you should probably bookmark and make an effort to visit.

Their most popular night is easily Saturday when then bring in a ramshackle karaoke rig that's fun, approachable, and non-pretentious. For every drink you buy at the bar, you're given a small sheet of paper that grants you an opportunity to belt out a tune. The karaoke DJ is a delight, and don't mind the fact that you'll be singing right in front of the toilets. It gives the whole performance some charm.

Drinks are a little pricey for well cocktails mixed with grocery store bottled club soda, but hey -- inflation. You can bring in outside food, and the bar is dog friendly. Two major bonuses that easily make up for any shortcomings you may encounter.

Ended up at this spot after our original idea was closed. Dive bar with friendly & hospitable service. Played pool though I'm not very savvy, we had fun! A few beers, good vibes & great laughs is one way to enjoy life. Check this place out for a nice laid back community bar.

Stopped in a couple hours ago for a quick bud run after a day in the park and I gotta say, one of the worst establishments I've been to. Besides heavy dust, the place was baby friendly but a bitchy old man (the owner I'm assuming) spoke horribly to female employees. If it weren't for the bartender with great sense of humor, this place would get one star. Seriously stay home gramps.

Want a beer? Montero's is a great place to go in Brooklyn. They only serve alcoholic beverages, but it's sort of a "Blast From The Past" kind of place. It can get quite crowded, but the beer is good and the bartender knows how to pour a good beer I discovered as he poured me a Guiness.

This isn't the bar to take your mother-in-law. Personally, I don't think you should take your mother-in-law alone to any bar. But that's besides the point! I'm here to tell you Montero's is your classic dive bar that has been there so long that I can only assume the empty phone booth that is inside has had many a sailor that....stole a kiss from a sweet dame. See, this place is so classic and old school that you become a person of the past. The place has cheap beers as a dive should. But Montero's has a "low key" karaoke scene that actually could intimidate even the greatest of weekend American Idols! I swear everyone sings so damn good! You know how to solve those fears and jitters? Yea, you know...more cheap drinks. The karaoke gets pretty full after 10:30 on weekends so make sure you get your song requests in! The bar staff are always willing to chat and poke fun at my group of yokels, and we definitely deserve all the sass they can give.

FYI, it is cash only, of course. (What is that plastic devil square you are handing me?!) This is Montero's you fool, The pride of the Brooklyn Piers and home to horny sailors(ok, haven't seen an sailors in a while) since the 1940's!

Dive bar without the grittiness.

The incredibly welcoming and lovely woman behind that bar (Kaddy/Caddy) is half of what makes this place so special. She makes you feel like a regular right off the bat.

If it happened to be the end of the night while  me and the wife were arguing and I absolutely needed a beer or  an excuse to get out of the house, I might pick this place.

The beer was overly priced ( in my opinion ) and they don't even play football games on sundays WOW

Mixed Feelings

Old dumpy bar with a lot of history behind it.  The bartender weirdly had the door locked and vetted us before he let us in.  I guess he was trying to keep out the riff raff.

This bar used to big spot for the Naval port that's down the street.  The bartender told us the whole story, almost to a fault.

Overall:
It's a cool dive bar that really looks garbage pit from the outside, but don't be alarmed.

Thanks

This place is hellish and the service is even worse. Truly don't understand how there are 4 stars.

Visiting from out of town with two friends, we ordered a round of shots to celebrate old friends. The horrifically high bar tender, Andy, initially told us our 3 shots would be 27 bucks. Then she came back and said actually it's 36. Since that was quite the unreasonable jump, at a dive, with no reason, we left 40 bucks in total.

She waved the money in my friends face sarcastically saying "thanks for the tip!!" (We all know you were pocketing that other 9 anyway).

I didn't see this happen and if I had I would have left at that moment. Then a few minutes later we got a round of beer. My friend paid for this round and Andy accused her of not tipping again. My friend paid for the drinks in exact change and was reaching for her wallet to give the tip. (Was she nervous in the .5 seconds she didn't see more money because she thought she wasn't going to be scoring after the bar closed?) Appalled by ANDY, we all gasped. She knew she was out of line and then tried to make up for it by sweet talking us.

Then she back tracked her all of a sudden caring demeanor and took it upon herself to explain to us that you don't order shots at a bar and that it's like ordering a margarita. We are very aware of dive bar culture. Ordering a shot is not a crime. Thank you.

Honestly we should have left as soon as Andy made that remark. I think we were all too astonished to even believe what was going on.

We went to a different bar as soon as we finished our beer. At the next bar a guy approached us and said he was at Monteros and saw the whole thing go down. He couldn't believe it either.

If rude is your thing, this is definitely the place to go.

Stoped in on a Friday night with family.  The place is definitely a dive bar; but an inexpensive, good times, dive bar.  When we walked in it wasn't too packed but within 20 minutes you could barely move.  We listed to some truly awful karaoke, had a few drinks, and went along our way.

If you are looking for an experience and cheap drinks, then this place is for you!!

Your bar must smell this bad to be considered a dive."

Visited this place after a holiday party. It was kinda outa the way and smelled like beer and puke. I lasted less than 10mins before I escaped.

If you're drunk and your sense of smell is gone, then this place is for you....cheap drinks and drink people...plus karaoke.

Cash only I think.

Somehow, after our weekly Brooklyn beach volleyball league games, we inevitably get sucked into the late night bar allure that is Montero's.  Maybe it's the cheap drinks, or divey, nautical atmosphere....Or maybe it's the sometimes-awkward, Rick Moranis-looking, good joke-telling bartender, Alan.

Either way, we always have a good time, and consume at least four times the amount of drinks we had initially planned for.  Although there's no kitchen, there's an awesome 24-hour deli (Champion) located a block or two down the road, and you can bring your food in too.

My only experience here is on weeknights, specifically after our volleyball games, so I can't speak to the karaoke or weekends...only to the jukebox.  My one suggestion would be to set the jukebox to play random songs when there are no paid requests in the queue.  There have been times when the bar is just about dead-silent, simply because nothing is playing at all.

Aside from that, Montero's is a great time right by the pier, so if the waterside "Bark Hot Dogs" isn't up to snuff, or if you're looking for indoor seating in a relaxed environment, Montero's is your place!

A classic example of a fun little dive bar with tons of heart and soul. I would call this place superb for the kind of bar it is. Staff and patrons: warm, upbeat, friendly. Atmosphere: shadowy, cloaking, and intimate, enclosing, encircling, enfolding. Soothing. Museum-like. Subdued, mellowed, and gentle. All the wood grain has that buttery, powdery, worn-down texture which comes from years and years of people's elbows and knees buffing all over it. A real pleasure, that.

Other remarks: I might style Montero's somewhat more of a place for hard liquor drinkers. You'll be side-by-side with experienced, seasoned imbibers here, old salts who can stand up to repeated, prolonged, series of shots and not sway in their shoes. But there are plenty of bottled beers as well (for you lightweights).

Overall: solid watering-hole for when the workaday world around you is too bright, too loud, too crazy. When the breaks are beating the boys; when you're up against it...when you're down to the very last nerve cell between you and a jail cell...when nerve is all you got left in the left-sagging cheek--of the only ass you got left--and that ass is being kicked left and right by all the feet in the city...Montero's is where you must come for relief.

So after a drunken Friday night at my co-workers farewell party, Stephanie was on a mission to find a good karaoke bar...  I put "karaoke" in my Yelp search engine and found Montero's.... Stephanie called to confirm that they did in fact have a Karaoke machine.  After being assured that they did, we made the troop over to Montero's.

When we entered, I was floored.  The place was a bit dingy... to say the least.  And lo and behold, no karaoke machine.  They guy that greeted us at the door kept telling us it was coming... we arrived at 9:30... what time exactly did karaoke start?  After waiting for about 20 minutes, we all just decided to leave.

Probably won't be returning...
...... yea, no probably.  I WILL NOT be returning.

I visited this bar one night with a friend and acquaintances after visiting another bar earlier that night. While vibe was good, it was surprisingly busy and crowded when we went inside. I had one cocktail while there. There was Karaoke there as well but there was a lengthy list of people who wanted to sing, so I didn't even though I wanted to. I spent much of the time in conversations while feeling nice from the previous cocktails. We left after a woman sung Anastasia's hit song "One Day In Your Life" which we enjoyed. Overall, I enjoyed my visit.

I live in the neighborhood and wanted to love Montero's, but sadly there is a racist bartender there. I'm Asian and was sitting at the bar the other night with my white friend. The white bartender said to my friend, about me: "You know you can't trust people like her who have slanty eyes." I've never had someone say something like that to me in my life. I very calmly and directly said "Sir, you really shouldn't say offensive things like this to people." He said, "It was a joke." He didn't even feel the need to offer a proper apology. I live blocks away, and when my friends come to my neighborhood, they often want to stop by Montero's because of its authenticity and interesting decor. Now I'll tell them only go if you're white.

My sis and I came to sing a couple of songs and had a ball. Everyone was really supportive and fun and even offered us pizza. Montero's is the bomb. Don't ever change, Montero's!

I'm a big fan of a good dive bar, but this place is really a dump...and they charge like they're an upscale establishment.  There's an old man working the bar that's pretty rude and had filthy hands like he just came in from gardening.  Had to convince myself that the alcohol would kill whatever he touched on the lip of my beer when opening it.  My fiancé just got a Diet Coke, he pulls out an 8 ounce plastic cup and a 20 oz bottle of Diet Coke and pours a bit in the cup and says $2 (that's normal if it was a normal size drink), when I questioned it, he snaps "this is Atlantic ave, we're always packed, we don't want soda drinkers".  Note, we were the only customers in the bar at the time.

Let's set the stage: Friday night at a bar in Brooklyn...

I know, you're thinking slender gentleman dressed effeminately, chicks in old lady glasses, and flannel.

But actually, Montero's has a bunch of middle-aged people doing karaoke and a few bedraggled law students playing pool.

Pretty confusing, but the drinks are cheap.

If less than one star was possible that's what I would give this place. Came to this bar late in the night and wanted water. Bartenders refused to give me water and made nasty comments and used profanity towards me. Incredibly unprofessional. Definitely would not go back due to the poor treatment.

Heh-- as someone said earlier, Montero's should be landmarked. Unfortunately with the changing neighborhood the bar may turn into a Banana Republic any day now, so get there while you can.

I love this bar and I even love the hipster-yuppies that are often populating the area and the bar.

If you come here to chill and have a cold PBR and are friendly with everyone, Montero's will become your local favorite watering hole too.
