Came here with a page out of the Brooklyn Pub Pass.

The Brazen Head is the textbook definition of a "neighborhood watering hole." It was filled with locals taking advantage of the happy hour specials and complimentary cheese and crackers set up towards the back. The bar is known for its rotating snack availability to patrons and its stellar drink menu.

We've all seen bars that offer board games to customers during their stay, but books? That's a new one. The BH had a stand of books by the entrance for its customers to flip through while they imbibe. This is an introvert's dream!

Their beer menu is very crafty, and they also have a decent spirit and wine menu as well. They have a selfie station in the back where you're able to use props and tag the Brazen Head on your social media posts. They also have a dart board which is where I spent most my night last night.

The BH has cozy couches in all 4 corners of the establishment. They also have outdoor seating for when it gets warm. Aside from the complimentary finger foods, they have potato chips and goldfish available for purchase at the bar. If all fails, you can always bring in food from outside.

The service was warm, welcoming, and fast. I can see why it's such a popular hangout spot. I would definitely return when I'm in the area.

A solid neighborhood bar. Spacious, outdoor seating, TV's to catch your a game. Good beer selection. I was in here on a sunday afternoon and it was quiet, FIFA game was on to be enjoyed. No ruckus.
No Food served but a variety of beef jerkies and chips are sold.

I would agree with other reviews.  Just a pleasant bar.  The bartender we had on this random Saturday afternoon was really cool and personable. Nice guy.  It wasn't crowded and a good spot to bring kids too, since they a little outdoor space or ample room when not crowded on afternoon days.  Otherwise, I heard this place gets pretty packed.   They allow you to bring in food from other spots, but they don't serve any food themselves. Gumbo brothers is right next door, and we picked up some rice balls and that was a nice little filling snack.  Nice little watering hole if you're strolling down Atlantic Ave.

Great atmosphere for friends. I usually go here with my co workers when I worked in the area. No Food, but during Happy Hour, they had FREE WINGS! The selection is amazing and I called and was able to reserve a corner booth on my last day of working. Definitely a great place with great and friendly staff that are always on point!

Cool vibe! Very relaxed. Nice happy hour, and great bartenders! Nice outdoor garden out back, where you can enjoy your cocktail, or one of their many beers or choice whiskeys, while smoking a butt, and not feel like an asshole. Only drawback--- no food. But you're welcome to bring in outside food to eat while hanging out! They also have themed happy hours. So they will bring in wings one night, grapes n cheese another, etc. I like it!

I have yet to discover anything I don't like about The Brazen Head. I have, however, discovered several things I really, really like about The Brazen Head:

1. Free wings on Mondays. No, seriously.
2. Cool bartenders.
3. Excellent signage game. I've smirked more than once as I walked by.
4. Good beer. Good prices. Good seating. Good happy hour.
5. They were the only bar open during that weird, intense blizzard we had that was the only snow all winter. And they didn't care that we carried in a dozen pizzas, and generally caused mayhem.

That's enough for me. Also, given their location directly between my apartment and that of several of my friends, I imagine I'll be here again and again.

I've been to The Brazen Head and enjoyed it each time. I don't work too far so it's often a place I come to with my colleagues. The drinks are good and depending on who the bartender is the play list is pretty awesome. I love a place where I can go and sing along to every song or learn a new song I can't wait to download.

There's a medium sized patio out back for those summer nights and day drinking opportunities. There's also two large sections in the front window areas that is nice for groups of about 5-8 people. There are also several televisions so you can catch a game if you desire.

They don't serve food but you can bring in food from outside. The last time I was there I saw a menu from the gumbo restaurant near by so that's one option for food.

Overall, it's a great local spot to grab a drink, hang with friends, listen to music, and/ or watch the game.

Came here last night two meet 2 of my girlfriends before heading to a Yelp event that was about 2 or 3 blocks away.

I like Brazen Head. I had never been here or even heard of it, but it's a pretty neat little neighborhood bar that isn't too hip, isn't douchey-fratty and doesn't make itself try to be something lame or overly themed. Bars that don't take themselves too seriously and are just innately 'cool' - +1.

Just your regular neighborhood bar filled with tons of publications, posters and flyers that support local art and events. Cool, I like when bars do this because you should totally support the neighborhood that supports you - +1.

Great selection of beers here, especially as far as seasonal craft brews (and even cask ale!) go. I had the SeaDog Apricot Wheat Ale, wasn't my first time - but it had been awhile and it tasted glorious.

My fellow beer-loving friend got a South Hampton Double and it was all sorts of refreshing, crisp and delicious. I also like that you can get any draft beer in 3 different sizes (S/M/L) so in case you want to try something new, you don't have to make a commitment to a pint glass in case you don't like it and this also makes for "wallet-friendly" beer sampling! - +1.

Couple this with friendly bartenders, good weekly happy hour specials, free party mix in a super generous bowl + a sweet looking backyard for outdoor boozing and you've got yourself a neat little bar! - +1.

I'll definitely be back here sometime!

If you're in the Boerum Hill area and need a chill place to relax with some good drinks (and FREE BAGELS) This is the place to go!

I've been here in a number of scenerios: Alone for the free bagels on Sunday because I just moved to NYC and was poor; reading by myself at a bar; catching up with a friend or two; lunch with a large groups of friends and wanting to get another quick drink. In every situation the Brazen Head is perfectly accommodating.

The bartenders are very friendly and the music is always great. Mimosas are good to excellent depending on the bartender (oftentimes there is a third ingredient after the champagne and OJ that makes it more sophisticated a drink). Very good selection of beers as well. Oh and did I mention the free bagels also includes a scallion and lox cream cheese and sliced tomatoes for your enjoyment?? Everything here is a great deal.

A dive bar with a good craft beer and bourbon selection, occasional tastings, a flexible bring-food-into-the-bar policy, and a high tolerance for annoying, rowdy Brooklyn Law School students talking about diversity and subject matter jurisdiction, the different between fee simple and life estates, and 1L crushes. The Brazen, as we affectionally call it, can be laid-back when those law students aren't out in full force and also televises sporting events.

The most notable minus? There's no food menu, so you'll have to go elsewhere in the neighborhood for those late-night or happy hour munchies (except Monday wing nights and Wednesday wine and cheese).

Wow I thought I reviewed this place years ago. It's a real old school neighborhood bar. It's one of the few bars I've been to where there's a real mix of young and old. This isn't a hipster joint at all, just a laid back place where the locals go. Beers are about normal priced but they have some good craft beers and daily specials. They even offer free food during some of their daily specials. If you're into cask ales they're the place to go for that, especially during one of  their "cask beer festivals".

One of my favorite features are their back patio, it's small and no frills but still has a number of stools and seats. They also have a dart board inside but you have to pass between the thrower and the dart board to go outside. I real design flaw but I'm glad they've kept the board.

-1 star because they changed their happy hour from ending at 8pm to ending at 7pm.

Otherwise, great bartenders, decent happy hours (and different substantial snacks on different days), dart board (pretty much where I've learned to play over a year or so of my patronage), patio. Great beer selection.

Gets a bit crowded on Friday nights.

I've been searching for a new bar to frequent on a regular basis, and I think I may have found just that at The Brazen Head.

Beers are all moderately priced, yay, and the happy hour goes late. If you want to impress whiskey people, they also have pours available for $9-14.

This is a rare bar that's good for groups. There are plenty of tables and a cozy booth up front that's great for a party.

I LOVE that you can bring food in, just today I saw a few dudes chowing down on Chipotle at the bar.  On Sundays there are free bagels (!) and $5 mimosas, $6 bloodies. Not bad for day drinking!

Always the go-to for me and a lot of my friends in the area. Friday and Saturday nights always seem to rig it a great crowd and the prices are pretty good for the area. The bartenders have always been very cool and attentive, which is obviously a big deal. No food menu, but the location makes it easy to find somewhere else to get something to eat.

Nice solid place for happy hour. Their cheese night is awesome. A wide variety of beer and wine. Good ambience. Bathrooms are clean and a very cozy yard for summer weather. Too bad they don't serve food. The patio is small but cozy, too bad is used mostly to smoke so non-smoker like has to avoid it.

I love this bar. Friendly bartenders, good music, reasonable prices and a great selection of craft beers and whiskeys.

What's not to love? I will be back... often.

Perfectly average bar in a good location. The vibe is alright, dark and slightly divey, and they have a small outdoor space with more chairs then they could ever fit back there piled in a corner - guess they were on sale. Went here on a date, and I would totally recommend it for that. Dark and quiet enough to have a nice personal conversation, and you can get away with only spending a few bucks for the night.

Solid drink special, $3 cans of PBR is right up my alley.

However the service is really slow. I went there on a Saturday and there was one bartender who seemed to be doing a great job at not bartending. The bar was dead and we had to wait way too long to get drinks or close out. Oh well.

I don't have much to say about the Brazen Head. I've heard of it before and always see it pop up as a place for happy hour deals in Brooklyn. It was near-ish a yelp event we were going to and I needed to kill an hour after work. They have a special every single day. Yesterday's was a shot plus a pbr for $4 and not something I was in the mood for. But during happy hour everything on draft is a $1 off and you can also get a half of a pint of something if you're not up to drinking something too huge. Kind of a neat deal. Traditional Irish pub and there is a back patio. OH! They had party mix with the Cheetos and doritos inter-mixed. Big plus because I didn't eat anything yesterday and that was my lunch/dinner. Really loved the South Hampton Double they had on tap.

Three words: free cheese Wednesdays.

Great selection on tap, even better sangria pitchers (my only complaint is that it's seasonal). Awesome beer garden open during the summer. Inside, there are large, circular tables by the windows for larger parties. Best bar in the neighborhood.

Cheap drinks, good atmosphere, and nice back patio.  Pretty good draft selection, but could vary it up a bit (85% IPA or DBL IPA).  Never tried their food, but this is our go-to after-movie place at the theater across the street.

Love this bar. They have a fantastic selection of rotating craft beer. They also have a great collection of bourbon. With sports in the tv and a back patio for summer you can't go wrong. They also have bowls with a pretzel mix on the bar. They also have a dart game you can play. They don't serve food but I don't mind that. In addition they have free wings every Monday night. Can't beat that. If you are in the area give this place a try. It has a divey feel but the beer and whiskey selection is way better then most dives.

For a bar with two bartenders the service is just unforgivable in how slow it is. The decor and seating space is good for groups and parties, but it can get a bit loud at times. Their beer of the day is always $5 for those who are looking to drink on the cheap. Maybe I'm spoiled from Brooklyn Ice House still, but I expected more from The Brazen Head.

Came here looking for a chill spot to hang out with friends. Luckily, we found a large booth and even some space near the darts board in the back. I got their current special, Not Your Father's Root Beer + shot of vanilla vodka ($9). The bartender offered to blend it together in a cup of ice instead of having each one separately and this was a really good decision. Not only was it easier to drink, but it tasted delicious and packed a punch too! I'd like to come back periodically to see what other specials they have going on.

Brazen Head is a cute local bar that I was delighted to discover is easy to find from the C Hoyt-Schmerhorn station. They had a pretty meh happy hour special however they had a great selection of beers!  I enjoyed an amazing SeaDog Apricot Wheat Ale and one of my new favorite drinks: malibu rum, sprite and cranberry juice.  That unique mix was created for me after I asked the bartender what it was and he started making it.  I actually really liked the service, the bartenders were very attentive and informative when two other of my girlfriends were asking questions. PS, draft beers come in small, medium and large sizes! Hooray! No worries about having your wallets raped here, folks (even if you don't get beer!).

My one gripe - the party mix bowls.  They have very large sized bowls with generous portions of delicious party mix but come on, how unsanitary to have a bowl out for EVERYONE to share? Do you know where their hands have been and what you're putting in your mouth? Yikes. May I suggest personal bowls for everyone or would that be asking too much? (Note that my girlfriends and I had a bowl re-filled for us with untouched party mix as per our request.)

Overall, I did like this place. The service was great and thought it was great they had daily happy hour specials.  Also, this place seems to have a cute little outdoor space.  I suppose whenever I'm in the neighborhood I'll be back because why not!

This is a fantastic bar for happy hours in downtown Brooklyn.  They have an early happy hour for the teacher which starts at like 2 or 3 pm and goes until 5ish.  Then they have the regular happy hour which goes until 8 pm.  Then they have the late night/over night happy hour from midnight to 4am.  They also have daily promotions such as Whiskey nigh (Tuesday), Ladies Night (Wednesday) and single malt scotch night (Friday).

The bar has an extensive whiskey/bourbon/rye/scotch selection, absolutely one of the best I have seen outside of specialty Whiskey/Bourbon bars.  They also have more than a dozen taps, and your standard offering of bottled beers.

There is outdoor seating on the back porch and a binder of menus if you want to get food delivered.  It's little wonder I have spent a number of afternoon into evenings drinking, eating and hanging out at Brazen Head.

I dropped in on a random Friday night after work and was surprised by how low-key (i.e., NOT CROWDED) the joint was. They even had a happy hour going, in addition to a cool beer+shot of whisky deal too, which I of course could not refuse. Pretty good combo, I must say. Even better, this place has an amazing bourbon selection! And the beers on tap are not too shabby, either. To be honest, there's really nothing I can think of to knock a star or two off this review for. Even the bartenders are friggin friendly!!!

This is an unpretentious Brooklyn pub I can roll with. Will definitely return!

This is a very good neighborhood bar. The bartenders are quick and super nice. They also have a decent selection of beers. I'm also told that they have free bagels on weekdays. When I went, it was a little too cold to visit the backyard but I'm glad they have one. Will definitely come back at some point, especially since it looks like they also host events or specialty nights here.

Don't bother going here if you have any self respect.  The 2 women bartenders were the rudest and unfriendliest I have ever come across in my life in the city. There are plenty of places to go in Brooklyn  that have a good selection of beer. As a professional who works and lives in NYC, I have honestly never come across such rude, unprofessional bartenders.
If the owner were to walk in on a Saturday evening and see exactly how these woman treat customers, they would be fired in a second.
Don't bother even opening the door to Brazen Head unless a hurricane hits and it's the only place to go.

Awesome neighborhood bar.  Not much else to do late at night in this area so this is a perfect place to get together with friends.  Has a dive feel to it, but the bartenders are always nice and helpful.

Brunch food on Sunday. Lots of beers on tap. Just off court street in Brooklyn. Not a popular area for night life so this place is clutch in that regard. Casual atmosphere.
