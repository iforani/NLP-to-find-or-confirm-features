While in Brooklyn I was riding around with my friend looking for parking to go to the park and ended up in front of this spot. We decided to get a drink while here and was served by Micho. He was a cool dude and was attentive. My friend ordered one of their beers and they had many to choose from and I ordered a pinot nior. My friend also had cheese fries. The pinot nior wasn't bad at all. My friend enjoyed the cheese fries and the beer. The bill was about $32.  All in all we had a good experience.

Walked to the table to be seated and waited patiently as the barman did what he needed to do. We asked to be seated outside and was met with a groan and alright. It was 7:40pm but still thought it wasn't bad we were coming for a beer or two and fries. We waited for a bit and then he sat another group down and took their order immediately. Then went back inside and attended to two other parties that showed up. Then went back to bar. Don't know what we did to offend this guy but we just did him the favor I guess and left. Super strange. Never felt vibes like that before. Oh well. Food looked like it woulda been alright too.

This was a nice place to stop off, outdoor dining and good beer selection. Had the fried pickles, which the pickles were good, but a bit too fried.

Basic bar located on a stretch of eateries for the after work crowd. Saturday afternoon, plenty of room inside this dimly lit place both at the bar and at the tables.

Large draft list is written on the chalkboard at the back of the bar, so quickly was able to order an IPA ($7) to go along with some Nachos w/Guac ($15) to start. Nachos are your standard fare - a big pile of chips topped with cheese, peppers, sour cream, guacamole ($ extra), tomatoes, and greens. Cheese could have been better but the cream and guac made up for it. For the main course, ordered a Pulled Pork Sandwich ($14); a meaty serving swimming in BBQ sauce, barely staying inside the bun. Fries that come alongside are seasoned well and seemingly handcut.

Overall the food was above average, the draft list is excellent, and the service is quality. Great spot for a low-key afternoon in the area.

Change in ownership huge decline in service and food. They used to have such good food! It was a huge disappointment to try the new menu and be so disappointed. The old chicken burrito and tortilla soup here was amazing. The chicken burrito now is much smaller. It's no longer served wet. And it's very bland.

The service has also declined tremendously. I can't tell you the number of times the bartender walked by our empty glasses without offering a refill. It was bad. But to really put the bad service over the top our bartender decided to "give us a little splash." That is instead of a typical buy back where a bartender gets a round for you, he took our glasses and half filled them. It was ridiculous.

I'm super bummed because this has been one of our favorite spots in the neighborhood. The old bartender Pete was fantastic. Another great bar bites the dust.

Great pub with a solid selection of beers and great pub grub. The bartenders are always cool. It's easily one of my favorite spots in Brooklyn Heights for dinner and a beer.

It used to be a pretty decent place, my girlfriend introduced me to it, she had been gong for years.

Recently there seems to have been a change of some sort in management or staff.  We've given the place a few tries recently but have officially given up.

Let night (a slow sunday) at 10:30 pm we went. We almost always sit and eat at the bar.  With very few other customers in the place and us prominently seated at a bar with only one other set of patrons ( a man and a woman with a 5-ish year old child), we went unattended though both of us were both thirsty and hungry.

We had enough time to turn the wait into a wager game.  I think we both lost when we decided to leave after twelve minutes of the bartender skillfully eluding our gaze through many personal distractions such as his phone and other pressing fidgety. We made eye contact with a bar back who seemed nice and saw someone else peak out from the kitchen, but the bartender could not seem to see us.

It's a bar, the food is meh bar food. If the service is good than its ok.  If you find yourself on the "pay-no-mind-list," you start to consider the nightmares Gordan Ramsey might find in their kitchen.

Walked in. Was greeted by a rude tall server. Rolled his eyed when I told him we wanted a table. Then when my friend asked if they had local beer (we are tourists and clearly don't know) he rolled his eyes and pointed at a menu and walked away. So we all got up and left. Found a spot a few doors down with a more welcoming staff.

Came here on a Friday night after work and was instantly greeted enthusiastically by the Manager, Michael. Michael provided great conversation and was polite and attentive the entire evening. I drank wine and decided to curb my appetite with an order of wings and a side of brussel sprouts. The wings were served pretty quick after placing my order which was great. What I found was that the wings were fairly large to come out so quick. The wings were glazed in an Asian Zing sauce which was flavorful. Unfortunately, the wings were under cooked which were pretty hard to get through. The Brussel Sprouts however were delicious down to every bite. I would venture to try other selections in the future to see how they measure up. The aesthetic still has the classic feel, which is perfect for those nights for unwinding and catching a game.

Post-dinner on a Saturday night as the Power Of One (me, myself and I) was mostly crowded- particularly by the bar area.  Tables are majority non-occupied and standing by the entrance waiting to be greeted by the hostess to be ushered to a seat was a few minutes of being invisible.  An American neighborhood pub located in Brooklyn Heights, typical, with TV screens plastered against the wall for the sport aficionados attaining their daily intake.  With a strong doubt I sensed a strong negative aurora for patronizing this business based on being invisible for several moments and the difficulty of flagging the waiter.  The service is mediocre as my server appears melancholy.  In silent acquiescence, she rose to her feet to place my food order and attain my wine without further ado - without a smile, without any life in her eyes.

Quality of food is MEH.  When inquiring for drink suggestions I was informed we have a full bar, okay in hopes of ordering a frozen drink Henry Street does not have a blender ergo why laid the claim "we have a full bar"?! False and misleading information.  They do offer a small selection of brew beers.

Côtes-du-Rhône-Villages (Rhône Valley, France) $11.00 - subtle finish for red.  I did not taste any oak.  Henry Street's wine glass contains a sharp inside curved ream, perhaps, to prevent spillage.

Caramelized Pecan Brioche bread pudding $7.95 - dessert from the daily Special was very heavy, rich swimming in caramel, ergo, I did not finish.  There is no shortage of pecan nuts embedded within either.  Caramel is a dentist worst nightmare to create immense dental damage.  I was not offered a glass of water upon being seated.  It does not appear that other dessert(s) were available either as a daily special or listed on their food menu.

Note:  No Discover cards are accepted- all other credit/debit cards are accepted.

I'm a Brooklyner since 1990. I've been to HSAH dozens of times and always had a reliably good time. The building has been family owned for 25 years. The interior is lovely and timeless. I hope it never changes. Sadly, there has been a recent change in management and with that, a rather concerning decline in service.

Like several reviewers (below) I too sat at a mostly empty bar and was unapologetically neglected for long periods of time. It's quite bizarre.

After three visits for a burger & beer at the bar, here are my tips:

* Expect a 5-10 minute wait for the bartender/s to notice you.
* If the bartender takes your order, smiles confidently and then walks away from you AND the taps, don't worry. You will eventually be served.
* Now that you have a beer you can flaunt it.
* If you finish your beer before your burger arrives, you should budget another 5+ minutes for anyone to notice.
* If the burger arrives and your glass remains empty, you should speak up lest ye remain unserved.
* The burger is fine.  If you say no lettuce there will be lettuce, etc.
* The fries are not delicious.

It's a shame. A venerable spot, spoiled by negligence.

My favorite local spot for a quick bite after work.  It's usually not crowded which is to my liking (although it deserves better).  The tap menu is always changing which makes it exciting!  On the food menu the burger is my favorite.  Outside of that almost everything else on the menu I've tried has been delicious.  The bar tenders here are usually really really attentive and are really ON their game!
On the more critical side, I wish that there were more full pint pours for all IPAs since they hardly carry high abv brews (9% and beyond).  I'd also like to see a stronger stouts and porters.  I hardly ever see any belgian style stuff, it's mostly on the lighter end of the spectrum!?
Ok, anyway.  I love this place - I do.

This bar is relatively unassuming, dimly lit and tucked between lots of other Henry Street food/drink options. But it's casualness and relaxed vibe is why it's so great.

We got there at ~8PM on a Thursday night. The bar was almost full but there were plenty of empty seats at the tables. We sat ourselves and received food menus quickly from the waiter. I had a pint of the Harvest Cider (delicious) and ordered the Burrito special at $15.

This burrito was SO good. Carne asada, guacamole, sour cream, pico de gallo, and black beans with a side of spicy salsa. It was wrapped and grilled--perfect in every way. My boyfriend got the friend chicken sandwich with fries. The fries are excellent and I thought the fried chicken was solid (nicely complimented by the chipotle mayo).

This place is a little pricey for what it is but the food is worth it. We'll be back.

Not a huge beer selection, but what they've got is top knotch. Great friendly bartender/owner too. Kitchen closes on the early side on weeknights, but can't blame them based on the area. Just get there early! Great music too, and tons of seating (bar and tables).

I have been a loyal customer of this wonderful bar for 15+ years...but recently and only recently, they've tried to change the menu and make the food a little fancier (perhaps to compete with other places next door)?

But here's the thing...they don't need to compete. They were perfect. An oasis in the sea of ever-changing restaurants with their trendy fare.

The staff and the decor are polite and wonderful, I just wish they'd stop doing whatever it is that they're doing with the menu.

When something's perfect, you don't need to change it.

Bring back the nachos, the house salad in those wooden bowls and regular lettuce and get rid of dessert again...you guys have it all wrong, all those other places should be competing with YOU.

I come here all the time. After a month out of NYC I came back, and found to my horror that their lineup has changed. The beer tap list used to be a bunch of craft beers which I was only able to get here, and which was worth biking over the bridge for. I would come here and in one evening taste several beers and drink three I liked. Now half the list is the usual unmemorable stuff: Brooklyn lager, delirium tremens, and, would you believe it, Stella.

I asked the bartender what had happened and they said the management has changed. I really hope they preserve the craft list.

Love this bar. When I lived in Brooklyn, this was a regular place for me, usually coming once every other week. Unfortunately I moved out to New Jersey which makes it a little more difficult to drop by since it's an extra subway ride, but I still do try to come here every couple months.

The ale house is super easy to get to, it's literally a block away from the High Street subway station on the A and C lines. They do a pretty good job managing the seats at the bar so you always have a place to sit when you walk in.

The beer mix is an eclectic one- but I say that in a good way. I normally consider myself fairly well educated with beers, but I often find ones here that I've never heard of.

The food here is definitely a notch above your regular bar grub. The chicken pot pie is enormous, and there's always a few daily specials worth checking out.

Wish the owner of this place would consider opening another location closer to where I live. The place has definitely grown on me since I wrote my original review a while back.

	2/14/2013Previous review
Owned by the same person that owns the Park Slope Ale House, this place takes 2nd place in my book.  A good selection of food well priced, the quality is somewhat less than I'd expect after being a regular at their other location.  Some great beers on tap, but a little too much focus on international brews for my taste.  Bartender is very helpful, but sometimes this place can have a bit of a snooty attitude.

I've been going to the Henry Street Ale House since I moved to Brooklyn Heights ten years ago, and am sad to report that the place recently took a very strange turn. They must be under new management who aren't from the area as the menu no longer has the affordable and hearty pub fare they were always known for, but items like chicken hearts (!), gizzards (!!!), and over-priced naked hamburgers. They used to have the best chicken pot pie, tasty fish&chips, and a massive burrito, but alas no more. The barbecue pulled pork was another yummy favorite and that's gone too. Also, my husband is a pescatarian, and there's not much left for him to eat there (even their vegetables have meat in them). I did order the fried chicken sandwich last week and it was a sloppy and really delicious treat, though I waited a half-hour for it to arrive. Hrmph!!!

I'll still pop in for drinks on occasion after work as they have the best beer selection in the nabe, great bartenders like big Jerry from the old Waterfront Bar on Atlantic, and I enjoy the music being played, but I'll have to seek out another place for my neighborhood pub food fix.

Love love love this sweet & packed place. The food and service was flawless if crowded. It is a very special neighborhood restaurant. I really enjoyed the local color of our neighboring tables - an older, elegant couple  in one side and a couple gals out for the evening, who were having a fine time loudly using colorful language. I love to eavesdrop and had great entertainment all around.

Hubs had duck - the best I have ever tasted, I had a classic Caesar and a bowl of butternut squash creamed soup. One of our group had the wild game special if venison osso bucco. Though we ordered key lime cheesecake and something deeply chocolate, the house gifted us with the best house dessert - 21 layer crepe. That was the piece de resistance! It was absolutely light as air and delicious!
A wonderful meal, a great place and a fantastic evening!

I thought it was meh. We biked across the crowded Brooklyn Bridge as the sky turned dark and cold, we were hungry and literally went to the first place that had no wait. I see why there's no wait. The food was mediocre. I guess the mini burgers were cute and decent but I wasn't a huge huge fan but it wasn't bad either for quick food. Out of the chicken, ribs, and mini burgers, I definitely favored the burgers & fries :)

Honestly, there are so many bars in Cobble Hill...this is the bottle of the barrel. Generally, the service staff is unwelcoming and drinks are over priced and under poured. They act like it's a restaurant so you are asked to be quiet yet its name is an ale house. If you're interested in eating eat food, then come here for dinner

I am beyond disappointed in what was once my favorite place in the neighborhood. After Ralph and Chris, who came from the old Waterfront Ale house left, the menu has completely changed. I am not against a healthy change, but there is nothing left for a pescatarian like myself to eat. I loved the blackened catfish, it's gone. I loved the burrito, it's gone. I loved the Mediterranean salad, it's gone. There are no fish dishes, the veggie burger is obviously a frozen patty that I refuse to spend money on, and the once delicious Caesar salad is now made with kale, and kale is terrible.
I will be making the trip a little further to Custom House in the future. I'm sad that I will no longer be seeing the excellent bar and wait staff, and I hope to find out if they get employment elsewhere, so that I can continue to give them my money 3 times a week.

This is listed as a restaurant and it uh, probably shouldn't be. It's clearly a bar that happens to also have some food laying around?? Nothing we ordered was good and I don't think they have AC??

Peter is the man. He really knows his beer and takes bar-tending very seriously.

Tiny beers during the summer changed me into the person I am today. Can't emphasize the tiny beers enough.

Try the nachos. Good for after a walk across the bridge.

The service was outstanding! Coming from Australia we were still a little new as to how to order and/or pay etc. at a pub but the bartender/server here was so friendly and accommodating to us despite her being the only one working and under  the pump.

The food was inexpensive, yet amazing. We ordered just small meals for ourselves but they were massive, and filling. The beer selection was similarly great. A beer, or cider, for every tastebud. Would definitely recommend, and revisit if we are ever in Brooklyn. Thanks for the great experience!

This is our "Cheers" - our go-to in the neighborhood. We were disappointed when they made the menu a bit too upscale for our tastes, but they are slowly bringing back their old standards. Terrific selection of beers on tap and service is always friendly without being annoying. I'm a huge fan of their chili (though I miss their homemade tortilla chips - those were amazing), burgers, nachos (they did recently return but weren't as good as they originally were), fried chicken sandwich...surprised by the 3.5-star rating.

If you come here ( a bar ) watch how loud you get bc the owner came over to a table of five on a Friday night to tell us to Lower our voices because we were too loud . His excuse is the " acoustics aren't good here ".  My man , the food was good, but you will never get our business again . This is a Brooklyn bar on a Friday night .. too loud ? We're eating burgers and having a beer , really ?????

Smh....

Update -
We just called the owner over ( after our gratuity was included into our party of 5, without us knowing ) to tell him how insulted we feel bc we were targeted in a bar that everyone is making noise in .... and his response is " I'm sorry , I couldn't hear myself think ". Sooooo did you go over to every table to tell them to lower their voice ? Or just us with the table of African Americans , Caucasians and homosexuals ?

Henry Street Ale House has a surprisingly great rotation of tap beers. The place definitely has a "neighborhood bar" type of vibe and is a great place to catch up with an old friend over a beer, as it definitely has a laid-back vibe inside.

Pete is a legend in this neighborhood. Total veteran, and knows everything worth knowing about the beers and liquors they offer, but I've been given great recommendations by the other bartenders as well. Their rotating draft is extensive, and I end up trying something new every time I walk through those old school doors, due to the fact that I have heard of about 20% of the beers they serve.

They have no WiFi, and reception isn't great. So leave your phone in your pocket and pretend you live in a more simple time.

Great selection of unique craft beers, and surprisingly really good food, for this small, local, pub!

Specifically, I always come back for the southern fried chicken. This is not bone-in chicken, rather, fresh, juicy, pounded boneless homemade cutlets, with great herbal flavoring....I think I taste celery salt? I skip the gravy, and sub out the mashed for their awesome hand-cut fries! All the apps are great as well! Try the cheddar jalapeño poppers with their rich buffalo sauce and sour cream, or the stuffed potato skins. Not a big fan of the burger- a bit too much if a char for my liking...

We like to sit at one if the two sidewalk front two top tables, for great people watching, if you can score one!

Their Jumbo wings are very good, the chicken pot pie was decent. They also have a good selection of tap beer.  Happy Hour M-F 50 cent wings!

And yes great service.  Why wouldn't I be back?
