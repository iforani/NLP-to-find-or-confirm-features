Adrienne's is hands down my favorite Pizza place in NYC. I have been coming here for over 10 years and whenever we have friends visiting from out of town and they ask us where is the best pizza, we always tell them Adrienne's.

Pre-Covid, I would come here during the week for lunch and it would always, always be packed. Inside and outside had every table filled. It would always be minimum a half hour wait. This is totally expected since it is FiDi in the middle of the week. Sometimes we would come on a Saturday night and it would still be fairly busy.

Last week was my first time back during Covid, and I tell you what, Adrienne's did not miss a beat. The Pizza had the same incredible flavor, the tomato sauce still had the same power punch to it, the sausage was just as flavorful as ever. Going on a Sunday during a pandemic, we expected to see the restaurant a little empty but for a Sunday afternoon it was bustling. So we were definitely happy to see that.

My recommendation is one baking sheet pizza for every two people. There are days I can eat a pizza myself, but sharing it way better that way you can have a taste of a few others. Sausage and Ricotta is my go to!

Our favorite pizza in the Fidi area and delivery always went well when we were feeling too lazy to go out for it. The dough is amazing and we were big fans of the Romana, such good prosciutto. And when you do go in person, Stone St is a beautiful atmosphere to eat outside on and pizza always tastes better accompanied with a Peroni beer tower!

Hands down the best pizza in lower Manhattan! Their restaurant is cozy and wait staff is always nice. Pizza has a perfect amount of sauce and crunch. The toppings are always fresh! I've also ordered delivery from here several times and they always come on time and pizza tastes delicious!

I've worked in the FiDi area on and off for about 14 years. While I was always familiar with Adrienne's, I never ate here or even tasted their pizza. Whenever we ordered pizza, it was from Harry's, which is very similar. As I was attending a comedy show in Battery Park, I decided to venture here for an old fashioned.

I called ahead and the staff was very friendly. They told me 15 minutes, but I got there in 10. I believe they may have just given me a pie that was ready since the person hadn't arrived--no problem with me.

The pizza was good, as I said, it's very similar to Harry's. Although I believe Harry's May be slightly more flavorful. If you don't mind spending $30 for a pie, this is your place that's locTed in the heart of the famous, Stone Street, in the Financial District.

The pizza was pretty good. 5 adults shared one old fashioned style pizza that comes square, as opposed to their standard 12+ inch personal pizza, which are probably good for one person, if you're hungry.

They didn't have any soup left on this Sunday afternoon, the place is a bit difficult to find, and the bathrooms in the basement need a good scrubbing and the door fixed.  The seating on high stools isn't the most comfortable as some seats have backs and others are just stools.

The staff was very friendly, prompt and courteous.  The pizza is definitely very good, but overall the experience is really just average.

Let me tell you, Adrienne's Pizzabar was awesome. Delightful menu items at great prices, amazing mood to unwind at. The menu is really outstanding, so many very good choices, I had to go with Lasagna, and it was wonderful. I became very good friends with the staff, who are all great and super helpful. Seriously! If you ever be around that area make sure you come try Adrienne's Pizzabar.

This place is located on Stone street, a very lively area with lots of bars and restaurants, all of them offering plenty of outdoor seating.
Inside Adrienne's the atmosphere is modern and sleek with wood accents and a long bar. We went late on a Friday, well after 9pm and were lucky to get a table for two,it's a popular spot.
The pizza is rectangular, thin crust and delicious with a crisp and puffy dough, and high quality ingredients.
My only disappointment was the Tiramisu, made with only one layer of mascarpone on the top, it did not have the richness we are usually used to.
Still, I totally would go back and recommend Adrienne's Pizzabar!

I'm not sure why this place gets the stars that it does. I have been here several times and each time I am disappointed. They are so busy all the time and the pizzas get mixed up and show up cold and dough soggy.  Too many better places to go in the city.  Won't return.

We think we got delivered a pre made pizza, well the crust with the cheese already cooked hours earlier and the procuitto and mozzarella put on when our order came in.  Our pizza was cold and it was delivered 20 mins after we placed the order.  So disappointing

Sooo good, had a old fashioned with arugula on it and a Caesar salad both large enough to share.  Caesar salad was loaded with Parmesan & crusty crotons.  The pizza came out hot, delicious & FAST.  This place gets very crowded But service was spot on.

The service was great and our waiter was very kind to us. We wanted to order some pasta, but they said they didn't have it, so I gave them 4 stars. So, we ended up ordering some Square pizzas. This place is good for a little lunch or breakfast. The beer tasted nice under the tent

What a great spot on a little street. Pizza old fashion was awesome. It's got such a great vibe.
Beer was brilliant and staff very nice.
It's loud and shared tables but what a nice time.
Definitely a-place I will go back to when down town with friends and family. I recommend it.

My friend and I got the old fashioned pizza with mushroom, garlic, and sausage as extra toppings. Each topping costs $2-$4 so the total came out to be around $34. It was a bit pricey for a pizza but I didn't realize how big it was until the waiter came out with it. The pizza was enough for two of us and we even took some of it to go.

I strongly recommend choosing garlic for topping because it made the pizza even more flavorful.

The restaurant also has a great ambiance, perfect for any occasions!

Walked in for lunch on a Friday afternoon, they have two entrances, one were the outdoor seating is and one in the back. I walked in the one in the back, no waiters even bothered with me...it made me feel like I wasn't supposed to even be in their restaurant

Ordered an old fashion with mushrooms, garlic and pepperoni. Comes in 10 slices. Honestly wasn't anything special at all, the sauce was just tomato sauce, crust was soggy. The total for the pie came out to be $45 and it was 100% not worth my money.

I had a work meeting down in FiDi and we grabbed lunch from Adrienne's. Normally I'm selective when it comes to pizza spots, but since I was with a bunch of my colleagues and wanted something fast and easy we decided to try it out.

We picked up a couple of their square pies as well as some Caesar salad. I tried their sausage-pepperoni. The crust was nice - not a traditional New York thin slice but also not thick like a Sicilian. If I had to measure thickness it's somewhere between regular crust thickness and the squares you get at Prince Street Pizza. Anyway, the slice was pretty good - nice abundance of toppings with a decent sauce. It didn't wow me but it also wasn't offensive. The salad was fine - nothing too out there, very basic greens/cheese/croutons/dressing.

Overall, I enjoyed my pizza at Adrienne's. Three stars from me for a solid offering but not blowing me away. That being said, if I was in the area again  I wouldn't be against returning.

This place has been on my "To Try" list for a while now, and we finally got to it tonight. So glad we did! It's a bustling little place with very attentive staff. We were seated immediately, even though I wasn't sure there were seats...but waitstaff just whisked a table clean and we were ushered into it seamlessly.

We already knew we wanted an Old Fashioned Red, no extras. My husband got a Brooklyn Lager, which he enjoyed in a tall, skinny glass. I had a cranberry juice because, hey, I'm evidently 90 years old.

In short order, our fresh pie was steaming in front of us, and we couldn't wait to dig in. The best word for our experience was "fresh" -- the red sauce tasted like fresh tomatoes just out of the garden. The cheese tasted freshly made, and so did the dough. It was simple yet striking, and we devoured that pie like the animals we are. Yeah, baby, that's how you do it!

Again, attentive staff. Clean space. Fresh food. We will be back!

The pizzas here are good but definitely not among the best I've tried in the city. They're known for their Old Fashioned Pizza, which is a rectangular pie (you pick either red or white sauce) topped with your choice of toppings. The base price for the pie is $27, which may seem high but it's designed to be shared among 3 to 4 people. I made the mistake of ordering a non-pizza item here once and will never do so again. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, STAY AWAY FROM THE PASTAS. Cocktails here are cheap (for NY standards) but not good.

But the thing I dislike most about this place is the service, which is abominable. If you're lucky, they'll just take your order with a blase and expressionless face (a la Kristen Stewart in Twilight). If you're unlucky, they'll even give you attitude, like it's so awful that we're imposing on them for their service.

If you want pizza and happen to be the area and are lazy, by all means, come here. But know that better pizzerias with better service are just a few subway stops away.

I had originally planned to meet up with a friend to eat outside, enjoy the nice weather and catch up... but when we arrived at around 5:30pm today, sitting indoors was the better bet. Was selfishly disappointed at how crowded and loud the outdoor area was... but the whole city was probably just out celebrating the beginning of MDW, can't blame them.

We got the margherita pizza to share and it was just ok. A little too salty (and watery?) at first bite but it progressively got better. The complimentary bread was very doughy and better than most but the carbs on carbs was a little too much. I also ordered the Hennylicious (cocktail) which was very good.

In terms of service, waiters and busboys were a little TOO attentive and I felt like we were constantly being rushed by them. They took away our oil/vinaigrette for the bread before we were even done, cleaned up the napkin I was still using, and asked us multiple times if we were done with our food when we were clearly still working on it. There were a couple of other tables available and no wait outside... not sure what the hurry was.

Still, I'd return to try out one of their famous square pies, and maybe during an off hour when it's not too crazy out front.

It's not a trip to NYC without making the trip down to Stone Street and having a pie at Adrienne's Pizzabar. Every time we bring someone new, it's their new favorite pizza.
We have never ventured away from the pizza, even though the other menu items look great. I couldn't imagine coming here and not getting pizza.

This is a pretty good pizza joint in the Financial District. Came here with some friends from out of town and we were all equally happy with our meal.

The pizza here is quite good, with a crust that's a bit thicker than a traditional New York slice. Toppings were quite generous and tasty. We got the rectangular old-fashioned pie with red sauce and half-and-half toppings. It came out hot and fresh and was delicious! The bruschetta appetizer we got was quite good as well. For drinks we went with wines by the glass and were quite happy with what we got.

Ambiance wise the place is quite similar to other restaurants in this part of town - it has an air of 'old school New York', with its high ceilings and warm decor. Service was quick, no-nonsense  and to the point. They did hesitate to give us a second round of bread though, claiming they had 'run out' but somehow discovered more bread and got it out after we ordered dessert.

Tasty pies in a historic and highly visited part of town. They need to work on their service, but the food here is well worth dropping in for.

Great spot on stone street. Must get there early! The lunch rush is insane. I got there at 1150 and made great timing!

Drinks are very strong. Recommend you getting a mixed one.

Pricing is a little more for the area but it's great pizza, which you can split!!

Damn good pie! Everytime I come to New York I have to have my pastrami, pizza and hot dog not all at once lol. So this was on my list of places to visit. After putting in my steps I decided to top off the night with a nice pizza. It's a straight up bar/restaurant. I was solo so I just sat at the bar which was full service. The staff here was great typical NYC folks. That's not a bad thing I love NYC . So I got served fast a nice cold beer and a hot pizza. The pizza was one of the best I have had. The crust was flavorful and the sauce was just right. This joint is a must for pie heads.

I've decided to visit Adrienne Pizzabar as a recommendation from a co-worker after work who raved about it. Usually, we opt for Mexican cuisine, but decided to switch it up.

Firstly, I do like the atmosphere and look of the Pizzabar. Nice seating and bar set up. However, what I did not like was the rush service. Give people the opportunity to know what they want! I enjoyed my half glass of Merlot my co-worker his beer and wine.

Be aware, there are no individual slices to order. You get a traditional square 10 slices total with a choice of toppings. We opted for extra sauce (which was not extra sauce) with arugula and chicken. The slice portions are decent, definitely meant for two people. However, I was not blown away! When your hungry and for their prices you'll make sure not to waste anything.

I've had better pizza elsewhere, but don't regret trying someplace new. I sincerely hope they look into training their wait staff to be a bit more patient and stop asking are you ready to order! Even while talking, they are ready to clean up and prepare for the next guest.

Overall, I won't be returning but I gave them three stars for the decor and drinks!

Looks appealing, but Pepperoni pizza was OK. The flavors are very strong. It is heavy on the palate. The crust was thick, but crisp and later on had hints of denseness. The pizza was very oily. The Parmesan pizza packet that was provided is expired on 7/12/2019, but today is 8/26/2019.

Met up with 3 coworkers here for lunch and it was pretty darn good pizza. Between the 4 of us, we split an Old Fashion Pizza with pepperoni and half mushrooms and a Caesar salad. The salad was lovely - perfectly dressed and super fresh. The pizza was really good. Thin crust and super saucy. I really liked that it tasted different than many other pizza spots in the city.

Between the 4 of us, each of us had 2 pieces and 2 of us had an extra piece. It's definitely a lot of food and very shareable.

Service was friendly and attentive. Our food came out in a very timely manner. If it's nice out, I highly recommend sitting outside.

Best pizza and probably most popular pizza place in the FiDi. Period.

For the longest time that I can remember, Adrienne's has always been the go to spot for pizza pies in the FiDi for just about everyone who works in the southern part of the area. Whenever the company departments that I've worked for are in need of pizza pies for a lunch meeting or pizza party, Adrienne's was always the 1st option ... and for good reason.

Yes, they don't sell individual slices and the pies are pretty pricey at $27+ (not including $2-$6 toppings), but they are worth every penny. Adrienne's serves 2 types of rectangular pies, red or white, with super thin crusts and customers can add a multitude of toppings, but they do come at a hefty additional price as well. In the last few years, I've had a chance to try many red pies, with various toppings, including pepperoni, mushrooms, roasted peppers, sausage, etc.

The pizzas they serve are extremely flavorful and delicious. There is a bit of oil on the top of their pies, but to be honest, it makes the pies SO GOOD. And when you throw your favorite topping on it, mine being their pepperoni cups, it's that much better.

To be truthful, they might be one of my 5 favorite pies in all of NYC. The restaurant typically is crowded during weekday lunch times and post-work, since it's located right by Stone Street, so try to show up a bit earlier to beat the crowds. It's pretty much no secret as to where to get pizza with a group in the FiDi, and even if you're not with a large group, you can always grab a pie and take the rest home because I can attest to their pizza tasting just as good hours later.

My friend brought me here and it was delicious. I had about four slices and had some left over for breakfast the next day.

The scene was beautiful. The pizza had the best flavors and textures I've ever tried.the weather outside was perfect. The waiter was very nice and polite.

I would definitely try this again!

What is life without pizza?! I ordered half OLD FASHIONED-crushed tomatoes, homemade fresh mozzarella, parmesan cheese (added basil) and the WHITE-ricotta & fresh mozzarella. It was thin slice and tasted amazing. There was just enough cheese, it wasn't overbearing. I love the location on Stone Street in the Financial District. It's a great spot if your around the city touring to stop by. They offer indoor and outdoor seating . I ate inside due to the hot weather. It is not too spacious inside, and it's good to go at a time where it isn't packed. Outdoor seating on breezy summer days is an enjoyable time. People are carrying conversations, you hear music or maybe a soccer game is on!  Great place to meet up with a group of friends or bring your family to!

Love love love ! My husband and I are from NJ been living in Texas for about 4 years and when we come visit we NEED our pizza fix and boy does this place hit the spot! We got sangria to start which was delicious and for food we got the old fashioned pizza with pepperoni and sausage we also got the margarita pizza OMG! So so good you can just taste the fresh ingredients and the blast of flavors ! I highly recommend this spot !  The old fashioned pepperoni sausage was my favorite the crust was even flavorful ! I'll be back and you should check it out ! Great experience !

This pizza is solid. One bite score: 8.4. IT's a bit pricey and the wait can be a bit long if your party is more than 2 people.

Wait: We waited about 30 minutes for a table for 3... that never happened. We have to settle for the bar seating.

Food: I read in a review to get the pizza well done. They intentionally undercook their pizza because of the volume they make. So ask them to leave it in the oven for a bit longer to make it extra crispy.

First couple of slices were total bomb. It definitely got soggy toward the end but still good pizza. I recommend eating it quickly before it gets soggy. Also the sausage pie was definitely more well done than the pepperoni. The pepperoni wasn't very crispy when it came straight out of the oven.

Would come back. Good pizza. 5/5. TLDR: 8.4 but get it well done.

I was looking up highly-rated pizza joints near the area of Wall Street and the 9-11 Museum, where we planned to spend the morning. Adrienne's came up and I liked the idea that it was in an area called the Stone St. District - an old cobblestone street that they've turned into a drinking and dining venue.

In dozens of reviews, I'd read about the Old Fashioned pizza. It comes in a rectangular pan about the size of a cookie sheet. It's kind of in-between thick and thin crust. The base price is $25 (crushed tomatoes, homemade mozzarella and parmesan). Toppings cost between $2 - $6 per additional topping. At first I thought that sounded REALLY expensive! But my husband, my two teens and I shared one with pepperoni and sausage and we felt like it was enough. It's possible that some of us could have eaten another slice, but the size it came in still left us satisfied. It's definitely a different style of pizza than the typical New York thin crust slice but we all enjoyed it.

One Monday I had a craving for a pizza from this place.  It was my first time in at over 7 years eating here. I don't eat here because they don't sell individual slices so I have to get friends to join me. It's one of the best thin slices of pizza I have had. But in this case I was alone so I ordered a cheese calzone for $13 and it was huge. Just by looking at it, I was like I can't finish this but the cheese and the bread was divine that I ended up eating the whole thing. I definitely want to come back for happy hour which ends at 6pm on weekdays, I believe. If any of my Yelp friends are in the downtown Fidi area hit me up so we can enjoy some awesome pizza.

Adrienne's Pizzabar is locates in Stone Street in the Financial District. Usually a busy pizzeria/bar, was dead on Christmas Eve.
Mostly known for their old fashioned square pizza which I'm known for loving. However, this time I figured I try something different. I decided to get a round pie. We ordered the margherita with pepperoni (of course).From the looks of it, I was pretty excited to dig in. The pizza was good. The crust was thicker than the usual NY slice. Wished it was crisper and thinner. The pepperoni, although curled the way I like, we're sliced really thin. The sauce was good and the right enough cheese that I would give it a 5.5 pizza rating. Nothing to brag about, but for what we were looking for on Christmas Eve, good enough.
