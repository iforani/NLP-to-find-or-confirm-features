Cool dive in Brooklyn, just off Bedford. Excellent cocktails although a bit pricey. It gets slightly loud in there in the evening so I don't recommend for a first date.

Friends from Marocco in town..,and I tooked them here!

      Great classic old-school bar.  Typical bar food..., with somewhat of a open patio / large doors..,for summer climates..,and Autum.

     Good Beer  selections, with Ale..,Pilsner's..,and Largers.  Brooklyn Brew company is not far away..., so they definatly had their Brew selections.

      Medium level 70's and 80's rock music..,mixed with some 90's ( "OffSpring") alternative rock.

      I'd definatly go back!!

Very reasonable prices bar in the Williamsburg area. They have beer and shot specials for $11 which usually is a price of a beer in the yuppie type bars in the area. It's super close to Music hall of Williamsburg which I was going to that evening.

The vibe was real chill and plenty of space to hang out with a large crowd of friends.

Great Brooklyn dive.  Dog-friendly.  Good beer selection.  Pool tables.  Nice staff.  Enjoyed the tunes the bartender was playing.  Fuzz on the stereo, local brews, and puppers to pet.  LOVED it.

Beautiful little bar with a pool table and pinball machine. The bartender was friendly and professional. The music was good. The prices were good. The beer selection is a bit limited, but it has good options on it for a variety of tastes. I would definitely come back when I'm in the area.

This place is a great place to chill and spend the day with friends drinking, chitchatting and there is a pool table that charges you $2 a game and in the back there are darts! However they don't serve food here which is probably the only downside....but they let you bring food in! The AC is also inside during the summer so don't worry about being too hot in one place!

Reasonably priced drinks with friendly bar tenders? Count me in! Only thing is I wish they had more outdoor seating or brighter lighting indoors. Otherwise, completely recommend if you're on a bit of a budget and want some drinks!!!!!!!!

I hate drinking in NYC because it's so expensive so I never thought I'd find some place so reasonably priced like Zabloski's, especially in the middle of Williamsburg!

The vibe is really chill. I came on Halloween night and it was pretty empty. Granted, it was a Tuesday. The bartenders were really nice and attentive and also made tasty drinks so I left very happy.

For an idea of how much drinks are, my friend and I paid $7 for whiskey sours and vodka pineapples and their specialty cocktails were $11. Such a good price for NYC! Would recommend coming here. Especially if you're going to a show at Music Hall of Williamsburg like we were. Only a block away!

One of the bartenders (with the beard, didn't catch his name) is horrendous. Not only is he dry and sarcastically rude, he's also homophobic. He refused to serve me after he asked me to stop touching my girlfriend "because there were other people around". Completely unwarranted and terrible for business. Avoid.

Friendliest bartenders I've met in NYC. Cocktails were very creative and definitely A+. Good local and craft beer selection Prices are reasonable for Williamsburg and NYC. I highly recommend if you're looking for a good local bar in Brooklyn.

Stumbled across Zablozki's during a night out in Brooklyn with my significant other and had the best time! Our bartender, Seamus, was amazing. The type of bartender you definitely want for a fun night out. Super quick service, wonderful conversation and an all around a good time! We will definitely be back. :)

This place is lit. The bartenders are the bomb - Shirley (yasssss boo!) and Shamus are hilarious, down to earth, and refreshing! Hard to find that in many NYC bars. The vibes are right, fun to get turnt or to just chill, and having pool, pinball, and darts helps too.

Right across from the very much played out Sea, I'm surprised a place this legit exists in such a touristy, gentrified part of Columbus' Brooklyn!

I'll definitely be coming back!

We stopped in for a drink before a movie. They had cool Halloween decor which added to the ambiance. Good playlist too. The bartender was very friendly and nice. Our birthdays are almost the same so that's a plus. Gotta love Virgo's! He makes a great aperol spritz. Go here!!!!

I think they're going to rename this place, "Don't Call Me Shirley", after one of the bartenders named Shirley. She is an interesting character!

Cool bar to visit in Williamsburg esp. on Sundays when the have (had?)  3$ mimosas.  Too crowded for me usually Fri or Sat nights, but nearly every place is.  Cool pool area in the back.

The other bartenders are ok but some of the male ones need to dress and groom more appropriately.

Also, the name "Zabloski's" has to go...

	8/21/2017Previous review
Stylish bar in one of my favorite neighborhoods.   $3 mimosas on Sunday were awesome.

If they had TVs behind the bar to watch events , that would be nice but there is one in the back of the bar.  Hippest neighborhood in NYC.

Came here to eat our sandwiches from the deli since you can bring outside food in only to find a super cozy, rustic atmosphere. Loved the wooden decor and Christmas decorations as well as the reasonably priced drinks.

My boyfriend and I kind of stumbled upon this bar. It was after a 90+ degree day at Smorgasburg and we were really just looking for a break from the heat. A quick search for cheap drinks led us to Zablozki's and I'm glad we found it. It wasn't packed on a Saturday afternoon at around 4.

Zablozki's is a really chill dive bar, that reminds me of a saloon. Plus, they have happy hour til 8 on weekends - $3 mimosas and $4 bloodys (which I can't say I liked - it was really thick and had this weird brown color).

Stick to the beer and you'll be okay.

I've been coming here for almost a decade! Casual low key atmosphere, cheep drinks. Whoever does the radio is awesome, it's like they're playing my ipod on shuffle. I used to bring dates here all the time, because it's a great place to grab drink and have a conversation. It usually doesn't get to loud or crowded.

Bartender not very pleasant. We ordered an Oktoberfest beer, it was light and gross. Not his fault. We asked to swap our beers. He said "Uhh sure, okay, I'll let Germany know." Thanks for the sarcasm? Whatever. We got a different beer, we both liked that one much better, not that he asked. We also happen to be sitting in front of the taps, so we got a dirty look every time he filled a beer order from someone else. Totally unnecessary if you ask me... anyway, my date says they get an extra point for having the New York Rangers game on, even though if you're sitting at the bar you can only see half the screen because the television is placed right behind one of the light fixtures... I probably will not come back here. Too many other bars that actually care about return service.

A quick stroll down from Smorgasborg on Saturdays! It was really hot out and my friend and I did not feel like taking cash out to drink at Smorgasborg so we did a quick search on Yelp and found this bar. They were just opening then and had the whole front open. We sat at the bar to drink. There were specials going on for mimosas during the day time so I ordered those. The drink was not too strong which is absolutely fine by me. They had a nice bar with a wide array of selections and if I felt a little more sure about my ability to navigate back home, I would have tried some. There were craft beers on tap, but not an overwhelming amount of selection that has you lost. The bartender was super nice, a bubbly young lady who was good about attending to us when we needed to order more and leaving us alone when we didn't need the extra attention.

Walked into this place all giddy expecting to catch me a few "$3 YuengLings" as the reviews on yelp mentioned. There were no yuenglings and the cheapest beer was a $4 bud light.

Although I was let down about the lack of deals that other reviews raved about. This place was ok. Not great not bad.

I've seen most of the nightlife on N 6th close over the last year or so, but Zabloski's still stands and hasn't changed.

It's got a dive vibe without being dirty*. Sure, they've got a cocktail list and sparkling wine, but they've also got pool and darts and pinball and cheap beer and chill bartenders.

* Except the bathrooms.

I love Zablozki's for being a bar. No gimmicks, no pretentiousness, no problems. You come here to drink. Just a bar. But a damn good one.

The drink specials are probably the best anywhere near Bedford, the bartenders are friendly (for the most part), it's great for groups or to make a few new friends, and they've got darts and pool. Yes, $2 pool is kind of a slap in the face, but when you've got a beer and a shot for $5, I tend not to care about much after about an hour.

They also allow food delivery. And seemingly, obscene public drunkenness.

The perfect "neighborhood tavern" standing strong in a neighborhood that continues to undergo a vicious, violent metamorphosis.

This is my favorite bar to meet friends in the neighborhood. Great vibe, chill, reasonably priced, comfortable, fun, and friendly. Just...

Make sure you know where you are, and get a beer. I wouldn't waste my money on say, their (slightly overpriced) watery old-fashioneds and other "classic cocktails"-- although they make the best Hot Toddy within a 100 mile radius.

Pinball, pool tables, clean bathrooms, and awesome music remain consistent "amenities".

With doors that open, Parisian style, onto N. 6th street (although, now you're facing cloying Nolita virus mutations like Le Labo) it remains a valuable part of the neighborhood.

DJ Questlove at the Brooklyn Bowl spinnin' the ones and twos...

It's so rare that I find myself in Brooklyn on a Thursday night. Nevertheless, at the insistence of my woman, I came to the Brooklyn Bowl for a soul-trainesque affair. Unfortunately, our compatriots decided to dine at Balthazar first and so having arrived late, we were unceremoniously forced to leave the crowded resturant in  search of a place to rest our legs nearby.

As my life choices are pretty much dictated by a combination of Yelp reviews and an incapacitating fear of failure, I decided to make my way to this well-reviewed bar to kill some time before the show.

The bar was somewhat empty when we walked in. There were a few people in the back and about 4-5 people sitting at the bar. The bartenders were two women who seemed to be relatively busy. I took a look at their cocktail menu and went with one that seemed to be their version of an old-fashion. The cocktails are cheap by Manhattan standards, about $7-8 per drink. PBRs were even cheaper, around $3-4.

There's a sign that says cash only but they do take credit card. LOL. You hipsters are so ironic.

For a place that serves decent drinks at respectable prices, there's no reason not to give 4 stars.

Carry on, Zablozki.

I really adore this place. It's definitely not to be overlooked, I have been here twice, both with groups.  The most recent time was last night on NYE after dinner and before heading to a big bash at another locale. The bartenders are always helpful and quick to get out drinks. I paid $6 for a whiskey sour which is in line with old Williamsburg prices and it was in a good sized glass. I was impressed that they had awesome NYE favors EVERYWHERE! Good job Zablozki's. It almost made me wish I was ringing in the New Year at your place because it was so inviting. There is also a pool table and dart board.

I don't often write reviews of places, even if I like them but when I feel compelled to write a review I just have to. Zablowski has been a neighborhood bar for awhile here in this neighborhood and I've never had a problem. Staff is super friendly, and atmosphere is rustic. I like that even if it's crowded it still feels quaint. I like to come here and and have a drink and think of projects that need to be worked on. Music is always on point and pool playing friends enjoy there pool table. Locals pretty much drink here and everyone is really friendly.

My friends and I needed a break from all the face-stuffing experience of the very conspicuously dry Smorgasburg, so we walked to this nearby bar to wet our whistles. The SO was familiar with the joint from her days in W-burg and approved.

It was remarkably empty on a Saturday afternoon, which made for a very casual chilling-on-the-patio couple of hours. There were a number of warm weather brews on tap, including a kolsch. Refreshing!

The bartender was friendly and there was no pretensions, stress, or drama. Vintage latter-day Brooklyn. (An experience that was nearly replicated at the Brooklyneer a few days ago.)

I don't know why so many bad reviews. This place is great. Been twice during my week in NYC and the bartenders Brandon and Seamus were on top of their game. Nice to be in a cozy, dimly lit bar that isn't a half assed attempt at being an Irish Pub and doesn't have some kitschy theme like so many spots out here. I'd happily come back next time I'm in NY.

Dying breed here in gentrified bk. As the chilax hip hop joints dwindle and honky tonky shacks pop up in abundance this place makes you feel as if all that negativity is halted. (Given you don't look out the window or around you). A definite place to relax and unwind on Mondays.

This is just a bar with chips yo purchase for snacking. Nice gathering spot, super low lighting and very spacious. They have great happy hour specials everyday, even on the weekend until 8pm. Mimosas were $3 which was a great steal! I'll definitely be going back!

We looked for a place to play darts around this area. And this place was great. Spacey and clean. The darts was in the back, I like this set up. People from far wouldn't see how well you are throwing, Only those who sit at the last table would see. Which is a very great idea!! which they did had more dart boards tho. They did had a small pool table and a pinball machine.

We came here on a Sunday evening and there was happy hour from like 12pm-8pm. SCORE! drinks were cheap and reasonable. I think like $3 for mimosa $4 for drafts. really good deal. Bartender was nice. My group and I stayed for about 4 hours and we had a great time here. Will be back!!
