My bf and I stopped here to just watch the game for a bit. Super nice and big inside with flat screen TVs everywhere. Perfect sports bar! Ordered the crock of French onion au gratin. Soo yummy!

(this is all before rona) went with my dad since it was the only place to eat after my physical therapy up the block, I think it was like 1pm. I had a sandwich and my dad had the steak dish. Solid food for a hub in that busy area. Bartender with the tatta was cool.

This is a good old fashioned bar. There are regulars, newbies, day drinkers and great bar food. There is a bouncer wed through the weekend and rarely ever more that 2 bartenders at a time.

It's a little homey and lived-in. No hooks on the bar for your purse, the counter is large so you've gotta slump over to eat at the bar, some of the chairs wobble, and the bathroom is tiny and run down. The drinks are a bit pricey, there are a few large flat screens around and a jukebox for music.

So why 4 stars? It has great bar food and good energy. Wanna hide away in the back and destress, sure, sit at the left corner table behind the bar. Wanna scream at you're favorite team on TV, feel free, pull up a chair at the bar and check out what's on tap. Or wanna meet with your crew and talk the night away, no problem, grab a high table on the right.

Now let's talk food...
BEST Wings in the area hands down! Meaty, well cooked, evenly divided and fresh. I like them dry with sauce on the side skin they stay extra crispy. Classic yet tasty sauce choices so you cant go wrong.

The turkey burgers are the bomb. Always juicey and filling.

The fries are simply delicious. I like the shoestring but the waffle are a strong second. Crispy, hot and made to order, salty, potato-ey goodness. They are a must.

So if you're in the area, stop by, pull up a chair get comfy and stay a while. All are welcome and you won't regret it.

Good for happy hour, parties, or just watching a game! Came on a Friday night. There were only available seats in the back. I believe there is a second floor too! The bar is dim and there are about 14 HD screens hanging on the walls that show different sport events. In the beginning, the servers were really unattentive. We went up to the bar to ordered the drinks from the bartenders. Later on, a waitress started coming to us and asking if we needed something. Their drinks are cheaper than most bars I've been to (Blue moon and Corona were $7 each and patron silver shots were $10 each). We didn't get any cocktails but they range from $9-$12. The only problem was their food. We only ordered chips n' guac ($8) and mozzarella sticks ($11). The chips were stale and the guacamole was bland. They served it with salsa on the side too. Had a fun night though!

Decent spot for happy hour food and drinks. Despite the location on Court Street in Downtown Brooklyn, the vibe is that of a neighborhood watering hole, as opposed to the corporate commercialism on display in the area.

I came through last week with friends for taco Tuesday. 3 tacos for $3 is a great deal, and the tacos got the job done. They are on the small side, so consider getting several orders.

Drink prices were reasonable, certainly cheaper than at artsy hipster joints, but with the corresponding reduction in selection. Note that they start a separate tab if you move from the bar to a table, do be sure to settle both at the end!

Good ol Irish pub in Downtown Brooklyn!  I honestly find it hard to find this kinda place in my area - everything has gotten so annoyingly "hipster Brooklyn-EY". Big, American & Irish fare menu, with burgers, sandwiches, lots of apps, such as Potato Skins (cheddar, bacon & scallions) - - really yum----nachos, chicken fingers, quesadillas, etc.  I have tried the quesadillas, and both my husband and I loved them!!  I saw a woman eating their ribeye one day when I went in there for a late lunch, and it looked amazing - served with potato & veg.  There are lots of TV's, and sports on, and I believe there is an upstairs too!  I'm def going to try a steak or steak sandwich next time!!
The bartenders are cool too!

I don't understand any of the negative feedback from this place- it really is awesome.

I mean if you have wine bar expectations, then yeah- maybe you're not going to have an amazing time, but if you're looking for a bar that always has a good selection of beer, good bartenders, reasonably priced drinks, good selection of sports on TV, enough space to bring a crew, and a business that chooses to support renewable energy- then you're good. Real good.

I recommend the nachos and fish and chips- also have you heard this history of this place? It's really a nice place to come if you're downtown for any reason.

You don't have to be an attorney or law student to grab a bite or have a drink here. Happy hour prices are a thumbs up. Or just sit in the back and order food. Different groups of people/friends can stand around the bar but not be on top of each other. I have had the wings a few times here and I like them.

Good:
-Happy Hour = $1 off all drinks
-Nicely sized spaced
-I order the 20 wings for a few bucks more than the 10 piece (bring the rest home)
-Beers come out as fast as you can drink them

Bad:
-Being PICKY...you can only get one type or one sauce on your wing order (can't order 20 and say 10 hot/10 BBQ)

5 stars for being the best sports bar in the area. Two stories, over 15 TVs, and slightly above average bar food. Full bar and standard beers on tap. The bartenders are super nice, too.

Come for sports.

I want to love this place so bad, but it's hit or miss constantly. The food is great some days and awful the next. I do however love their wings. That's all they can get right.

But let's talk service, it's just plain awful.  At the  end of the day their waitresses are like a revolving door and they have yet to get one attentive one. It's not brain surgery.  The bar can be empty and there isn't a person to be found.

I keep returning here because it's a quick convenient spot, just wish their service and food was more up to par.

Great place to grab lunch, or simply come after work and unwind.. ms. Edel the bartend was amazing and very charming....
the French onion soup was the best I've had in a very long time and they kept It simple and traditional, which is a nice thing in these modern days of cuisine..

Plenty of tv's for game nights and two levels for plenty of room and comfort...
I would definitely recommend this spot for all your needs ...

Found this place on yelp but was pretty disappointed ultimately. The place was extremely loud, service was slow (and the waitress seemed like she did not want to be there at all), and food was low quality/not good. No napkins or silverware were provided or available. The waitress didn't come to check in on us and after waiting over 20 minutes for the check, we just went downstairs to close out. The wrong order was also brought out. We will not be returning.

Great place for drinks and amazing wings. They are well known for their honey garlic wings and for good reason. The honey garlic wings are very unique and original and is a must try. Their hot wings are amazing as well and have a great kick. Service is usually great but once in awhile you'll get a waitress who doesn't come around a lot.

I went to O'Keefe's my very first night in Brooklyn, after a long day of moving. In search of a sports bar with decent food to stuff my face with and ample TVs to watch a game, O'Keefe's delivered on my wishes. While there are more than enough menu items to choose from, they kept it pretty straightforward, offering traditional sports bar sandwiches and appetizers. I opted for the Philly Cheesesteak Wrap with American, which was delicious. I even believe it would have been this good had I not been extremely hungry at the time! There is also a vast draft and bottled/canned beer selection.

The atmosphere was great at O'Keefe's, as well. This is a very unpretentious bar, great for either groups or those (like I was) hoping to catch a game by themselves. No judgment, unpretentious, and friendly sum it up. Lastly, there are huge and huger TVs everywhere, so no seat is a bad one. I'll be back to watch games and chow down in Fall.

I had an ulterior motivation for causing a fuss over fear the sandwich in front of me would be inferior to the one I had ordered. My plan was to score two sandwiches by raising the issue of my wrong order, with the hope that they would not take away the food that they had already served. As they say, the road to hell is paved with cheap intentions.
I debarqued from my stool at the high-top to officially complain. The two waitresses appeared oddly pleased that I had brought the mistake to their attention and I walked away on cloud-nine as their smiles signaled goodwill and yes, free sandwiches. Yet, they yanked my original plate from the table with a zeal that made me think my ingenious plan was in fact far too common.
They served me my new sandwich and it sucked. The raw and thickly-sliced onions overwhelmed the sickly, chewy shrimp. There was zero dressing and the bread crunched like a stale booger. Rather than reinforcing my belief that the Shrimp Po'Boy exists, the ghastly sandwich had deconstructed my reality. 'C'est ne pais un Shrimp Po'Boy', the sandwich told me.
This story does not have a happy ending. My Saints lost their ball game and I got food poisoning. I was sick for 24 hours and felt the shrimp sloshing in my tummy while the sandwich continued to taunt me in my memories.

Came here for a 3rd time with a co worker & the I had the blackened salmon with veggies which was just string beans & carrots & yellow rice. The salmon was eh, the veggies were eh & the rice just wasn't good. My co worker had honey garlic wings which was good & waffle fries. I wish I would've got that. Since this is a bar, I guess it's not good to order anything besides finger foods.

The drinks are good & it's decent prices. Being that there in a very busy work area, it would be nice if there was a happy hour since it's a bar. $1 off drinks I don't consider "happy hour". The food was ok as well.

"O'Keefe's Bar & Grill" is legit! It is a Sports Bar like no other. I'd like to tell you my story.
Parking is a huge issue around the business district, so I'm lucky I got there early. After a short walk it was hard to see the place because they don't have the name displayed above the building, just on the black glass windows, which is hard to see. Coming inside I immediately became excited with the look of the place. It's very modern and very clean with TV's everywhere. They even have a second floor with more TV's playing. When I was ready to sit there wasn't that many spots open because this place does business. They offered us at table and we took it. The waitress was incredibly nice and helpful, she was at my table often and cared about my enjoyment. The owner even walked up to the table and asked where we wanted to watch the Giants game. What! I thought that's cool. He was a really stand up guy and I'm not just saying that because he's obviously a Giants fan. What was better then the staff and look of the place was the food. I was completely taken back by how good it was. The popcorn shrimp was incredible and the sauce they used with it. Also the buffalo wings were delicious. They used a honey garlic sauce that was to die for. Finally my burger, now that was a burger. It had crunchy bacon, plenty of cheese and the onions were sautéed well. This place does sports well. I was completely satisfied and will return. What would make this visit better is if the Giants come away with a win.

When I'm not lawyering, Yelping, trading stocks or hosting dinners I'm solving the JFK assassination(what should really be called the Right Wing Coup of 11/22/63)......More about that later.

After the nice subpoena clerk in Brooklyn Supreme Court told me I had to come back in two hours because her office was closing, I had two hours to kill. I decided to plop my butt down at O'Keefe's Bar & Grill to enjoy a burger and brew and read "The Dark Side of Lyndon Baines Johnson", a book everyone should read.

A pleasant young female server greeted me in the dining area.After she patiently answered my questions about the respective merits of two Sierra Nevada brews, I chose the Pale Ale.

It came just as I like it: cold, refreshing and delicious. I ordered a Bacon & Cheddar Burger. The 8 ounce beauty arrived perfectly medium as requested. It was full of mineral flavor and luscious, making my taste buds do Karaoke.The generous portion of accompanying fries were of the crisp variety. They were tasty and not greasy.

For those of you under 40, the key to understanding the 1963 coup is googling "Lyndon ducks". But I digress.....after enjoying my great burger and brew I'm handed a check with my server's name........ "Marina".....the same as Oswald's wife. Synchronicity baby!!!!!!

The food is average here. We Went there for lunch there was no lunch special so we ordered from the kitchen menu. My colleague ordered a burger but it was too salty and they changed it to fish and chips. I ordered the Cajun chicken sandwich it was average for Cajun chicken really liked the fries though.

Went to O'keefe's for the first time on Friday after doing some local shopping, and needed to grab a quick bite before a movie. Was also hoping to find a replacement pub for our beloved Cody's which has closed. Ordered the basic pub staples, wings, burger, Ruben and buffalo chicken sandwich for our party of four. The waitress was upper attentive when we arrived, but once the food came out, it quickly went downhill. For starters, my buffalo chicken sandwich consisted of two flimsy pieces of chicken that barely filled the sandwich, vaguely tasted of buffalo sauce and consisted of nothing else, I mean nothing, no lettuce, no tomato, no sauce, just bread and chicken. We tried to get another drink, but our waitress was not around. Then when we got to the bottom of our fries and we found a long hair. Talk about being completely disgusted! We tried to get our waitresses attention, but she was still MIA. When we finally flagged her, and showed her the evidence, she said we needed to inform her immediately. Pretty hard to do since  she wasn't around. Not only did her apology seem insincere, she claimed to be unable to provide a discount because there was no manager, and she didn't even offer a complimentary anything to compensate for the issue. The service was poor, and the food was beyond unsatisfactory especially since it was far from crowded. Needless to say, we will never go back there, nor recommend to anyone, and are still looking for a replacement for Cody's, which now seems imposible to do!

Mediocre Irish pub, actually it is more of an American sports bar and grill despite of an Irish name.  It lacks all the traditional Irish food staples:
Corned Beef & Cabbage Casserole
Dublin Coddle
Beet Cabbage & Pecan Salad
Irish Soda Bread
Shepherd's Pie
Shamrock Salad
Whiskey Cake
Irish Colcannon
Irish Potato & Leek Soup
Potato Farl
Boxty

Saturday night out in town with party of two.  We dined to bacon grilled cheese $8.70 and one turkey burger $11.95.  No alcohol intake for either of us.  My turkey burger was okay as it was not juicy but MEH.  Service is extremely too efficient as upon sitting down we did not have time to scan thoroughly the menu to make a selection.

My sister and I went to have wings since it was .50 cent. I ordered 10 hot she ordered 10 honey garlic. Half the drums in the chicken was not done at all in either of our plates. Which was disgusting. Also we always had to find the waiter for our table but she was really nice. The best thing was the margaritas and the fries. I will go back again just for something different. If you do go here do not order the hot wings.

This bar I have been to for years and by far the best experience was last Friday.My bartender forgot to get his name but he is very on point.This man knows how to pour a drink.Only thing that stop me from giving this establishment five stars is ,happy hour in my opinion could be better and no music really unless you playing a selection on the juke box.

O'Keefe's is a great bar and grill and is thus aptly named. I'm originally from Minneapolis where bars often have, well, bar food. Not so much here but O'Keefe's most certainly does and it's good. It isn't fancy and it isn't gastro spotted anything, but the food is quite good and comes out quickly so you can have lunch and get back to work or jury duty or whatever. I like the chili (bean or beef) which is your bargain yet filling dish. There is a salad special everyday and those are good as well. The caesar is no joke. Plus the service is great. The bartenders will chat you up or leave you alone - whichever you prefer. Note that if the bar and tables are full there is seating upstairs, though you would never guess it.

I've been here several times for lunch with coworkers. There has never been a wait to get seated.

We always get the wings because they're priced well. Combine them with a basket of waffle fries and a drink and we're paying just about $15/person.

Favorite wings flavor: Honey garlic. The wings come with blue cheese with everyone and there's some celery and carrots on top of the wings.

Your typical sports bar. It's never really been too crowded when I've gone in which is nice because you can usually just walk up to the bar and grab a drink or eat. The food is generally ok, but the wings can be pretty hit or miss. Sometimes they're outstanding and other times they're dry and kind of tasteless. It's a shame because their buffalo sauce is actually really good when they use enough of it. Wings should be messy and dripping in sauce, not half-covered.

The overall atmosphere is really nice though and the reason why I'm giving them four stars instead of three. It might sound weird to say this about a bar, but the place is really warm and inviting. The service is fast and friendly as well. Doesn't matter whether I'm alone, with my gf, or with a group; I always have a good time at O'Keefe's.

Horrible service. Overpriced food. No functioning air conditioning when it feels like over 100 degrees. This place is lame and should be shut down. $12 wings? What?!  And I'm posting a picture... empty, no service

Inattentive and unfriendly bartenders, they are more interested in chatting/gossiping with each other or being on their phones than serving customers. Draft beer tasted off too. Not an enjoyable place to have a drink.

Okay bar in Brooklynn my gf and I wanted to check out while in town. Inside feels like a good old school bar and I loved the atmosphere.
However, drinks were overpriced. I got a Bloody Marry and it wasn't that good, asked for it spicy and all I got was the mix and vodka but I'm sure draft beer is fine.

I've been a frequent patron of this location for years (thanks to my BFF, Pika). It has always been a super chill spot to hang out, grab a beer or some grub.

A very unassuming atmosphere with amazing bouncers and bartenders. The waitresses are another story, it's often a hit or miss with them.

Sometimes, they'll be spot on in terms of service and knowledge on what the specials actually are. Other times, a couple are in a dizzy, fluttering about to no where with a lack of attention to details on service and your order.

One particular waitress had the audacity in positioning her self to educated me on 'tipping' before I left. I was seriously offended  (as I work in the hospitality business), I'm known to be overly generous when I leave gratuities.  I did express to her "... not to allow the brown skin to fool her".

Aside from that incident, it's always a grand time. I also came here on St. Patrick's day to celebrate. I usually have the sampler, which is quite good (nothing five stars) but it's bar food and washes down easy with beers or Margaritas.

I wished I lived in the area, I'd be here weekly. Certainly a cool spot to check out before or after a movie at the near by theater or after shopping at Barns and Nobles or Sephora.
