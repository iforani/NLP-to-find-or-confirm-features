Review: WOW! Came to Felice during COVID and it couldn't have been more ambient of a set-up upon our arrival. Food was DELISH and our server, Meghan, and the general manager, Mina, could not have been warmer while both serving us.  Pro tip: try their house wine which comes from Felice's vineyard in Tuscany!  And be sure to check out the inside, which is stunning! THANK YOU Felice for a great evening and dinner!

Delicious food and romantic, opulent decor.

I came here for the time during Restaurant Week 2019 and since then, I have been back a ton of times. I REALLY love Felice. This is the perfect date night spot! Everything from the lighting to the wood finishes give off an "expensive" vibe but their prices are actually very good for the area.

Their cocktails are anything but basic, and their pasta is always super fresh.

On my list of the best Italian spots in NYC!

Cute spot for Italian fare.  Delicious ricotta crostone, the lasagna had more sophisticated ingredients than usual which I appreciated.  Attentive staff and relaxing atmosphere.

The restaurant has two floors and is situated inside a hotel. The top floor was surrounded with bookcases. Overall service was good, the General Manager was knowledgeable and was helpful in narrowing our choices. In addition, we took advantage of wine pairing option which was $15 for NYC restaurant week brunch. Now to the meal:

Appetizer: We ordered the arancini. The arancini serving was made for sharing. I only ate three and I was already full. The appetizer was cooked to perfection in terms of authenticity. Therefore, definitely got my money's worth with this choice.

- Entree: We ordered the Chicken Milanese which was huge. The taste and texture of the chicken was on point. When combined with the cheese, tomatoes, arugula and balsamic vinaigrette it was one of the most perfect bite I have had in a long time. The dish was so huge I took it to go and had it for dinner. Definitely a dish worth getting.

Awesome food and portion size. Definite hidden gem. Can't wait to return for happy hour and will be returning for a private holiday party.

Totally delicious! I don't think there is a dish here that wouldn't be yummy. I was here with a group
And loved everything about it- from the lights to the bottles of wine to the seating! So cozy. But not too intimate. I was at a work dinner with my colleagues and it was very relaxing. I had a great salad with avocado and delicious heirloom tomatoes. My pasta dish (I never have pasta mind u) was out of this world- frutte de mare! So delicious paired with a yummy red wine. I love that it is attached to the Kimpton Hotel somif you want to play chess or take out a bicycle you can! This is such a special night out in my book! Waiters are very knowledgeable as well!

I was honestly surprised this place was so good! We couldn't find reservations anywhere on a Friday night at 8 pm last minute (hello outdoor dining) and live in FiDi. I called ahead and to my surprise they had a table for 5 available. Our table was ready for us when we got there, very clean and following all safety procedures. We ordered a bottle of wine for the table at the waiters selection and ordered some specials for the evening. The butternut squash risotto was fabulous! We will definitely be returning!

Hidden gem in the heart of Fidi! I've lived here for over two years and I'm disappointed in myself I've only discovered Felice this week, but thank goodness I finally did! It's situated in a perfect location easy to walk to no matter where in Fidi you live. It's also a 3 min walk from Fulton street station or 5 me walk from wall street station so super convenient.

What I love about this place is the dark lit atmosphere, service, and of course the food! It's the holidays so they had a fresh Christmas tree that smelled so yummy and beautiful lantern lights upon walking in. We made a same day reservation without issue and were seated near the bar area. The tables have this beautiful small lantern light so unique and perfectly set for the historic financial district. It was something so small, yet to perfect.

Let's get to the food. It's Italian fate with a great selection of imported beers on tap and by bottle along with a long list of wines. So for you all who like a unique drink here is the spot. Beware of the bread with their branded olive oil! It's addictive. For starters we went for the bruschetta Crostini (serving size  3) and the arancini balls, which to my delight might vegetarian friendly.  Our table got the soup of the day cauliflower and leek served in this cute wooden bowl and also a house salad which had some mozzarella balls and avocado in it. Bonus!

For Entrees the Branzino was the winner Served with a fennel salad and cooked to perfection. The skin was nice and crispy, but also not over cooked. Sometimes they undercook fish and it grosses me out, but the branzino was cooked and flavored perfectly. Close runner up cane the Fusilli al Ferretto  with tomato sauce, creamy burrata cheese, basil. When you order it the burrata is on top and you stir it in. Such a beautiful dish. We also tried the Ravioli della Casa which was the only dish we weren't a fan of. Too heavy handed on the spinach and it was a bit oily.. The Linguine di Mare was also good, but not amazing.

I did my usually food spying on other tables and the lasagna classico and Spaghetti Cacio e Pepe seemed to be people's choice. Looked amazing and I definitely want to go back to try.

To close the meal we got the classic Felice's Gelato Sundae. It's a great sharing desert and can definitely feed at least 4 people. It's served with these cute swirl cookies and homemade whipped cream!

Service was on point. Everyone from the front of the house to our server and bartender were beyond hospitable. They provided great recommendations and just overall nice energy. Overall great spot. Great for a dinner date with the candle light, great for a group, family, whatever!

I came here for dinner on Friday night, and it exceeded my expectations. The manager, Mina, made us feel right at home.

My boyfriend and I always order the meatballs and ricotta toast to start since both are delicious and easily shareable. For a main dish I always order the specials, so I got the cheese-stuffed pork chop. Oh my god it was incredible. Then for dessert we ordered the lemon chiffon cake and the hazelnut cake. Both were delicious.

They also have a great wine selection and very good cocktails. You can't go wrong.

The service was awesome too: our waiter Carlos was super attentive and very helpful with our menu choices.

My favorite restaurant in the city, I will obviously be back!

I love Felice and I've been here multiple times, for dinner as well as brunch since both are excellent.

The restaurant has a very romantic feel at night but bright and spacious enough for families during the day. There is a small bar off to the side in case you need to wait a bit for a table.

For brunch I love the French toast. And for dinner I almost always get their specials. The food is always super tasty, and I've never had a dish I didn't like. For a starter though, I recommend the ricotta tartine. If you love ricotta you will die it's so good.

The only reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five is for the inconsistent service. Most of the time I've gone here in the past the staff is very friendly and doesn't hesitate to make sure you are comfortable and happy with your food. Yesterday I came for Mother's Day brunch though, and our waitress was very short and inattentive. Hopefully it was a fluke thing though.

I decided to order a minestrone soup today for lunch . It was odd, usually minestrone is a tomato based broth. It was tasty though, a little too oily for my taste though. The bowl was $14, with a diet coke it came out to be $20. Also, the service was super slow. So if you're in a rush for lunch, this may not be your place

This place is amazing. I love how it looks inside the decor makes it cozy but trendy. The food was incredible. We ordered several meals and enjoyed every bit. The staff was very well trained and professional. Our waiter was also very thoughtful. It was our friends birthday and he picked up on it from the conversation so he brought a creen brûlée with a candle on it. Amazing service! I would highly recommend going here.

Came in tonight for restaurant week and it was really good!  The ambiance is pretty although very dark.  The service was good.  For our meals we started with the ricotta crostini and the arancini.  Both were delicious.  For my main meal I had the chicken Milanese.  It was a good version but not great.  The chicken could have been salted or seasoned.  I didn't really care for the choice of the wild arugula on top either.  It had a lot of stems.  My friends both had the cacio de Pepe and I tried it and it was really delicious.  For desert we all had gelatos we had vanilla pistachio and hazelnut.  The pistachio was my favorite.  I would definitely return

This place has a beautiful inside architecture and a classy and laid back ambiance.
I enjoyed the food and the service.
The rice balls appetizer is good.
The sauce for the Fusilli was a little too rich; it's served al dente (not boiled thoughly), but good overall.
The Felice sundae was good.

I plan on visiting again, hope the service is e
even more friendly and food even tastier.

I passed by Felice multiple times a week but discounted it since I assumed it was just an average hotel restaurant. I came here on the recommendation of a friend.

The restaurant is very large inside, very dimly lit, and accepts reservations. It's a great place to get together with a bunch of friends over good food, and a fun ambiance.

We ordered the meatballs appetizer - super delicious, super saucy, great taste and texture. We also ordered the Linguine di Mare. The linguini noodles were a good texture, and there was plenty of seafood to last the whole dish! I wish that the sauce were slightly stronger/more flavorful but altogether the dish was really good!

We also got the Fettucine alla Bolognese and this dish was SO good. Loved the red sauce, loved the veal, and the pasta really tied everything together. Would definitely come back for this Fettucine dish!

I love the location and its atmosphere. Romantic and cool at the same time. The selection of wine is brilliant. I tried one produced by their winery in Tuscany. The manager Flavio was really nice and his tip for the main course was excellent. As Italian,​ I demand high quality when comes to this type of cuisine​e. Highly recommended​.

My frirnd takes me here for lunch. It's a very adorable little place. The decor is simple and pretty.
The food was great.
We had the mussel appetizer. It was soft, sweet and melt in your mouth.
Interested fettuccine alla bolognese was great. Perfect blend of meat sauce and pasta was definitely al dente.
My friend had pappardelle con salsissia - the sweet sausage was great as well.
If I had one complain would be the amount of time it took for dishes to arrive.
We ran out of time and will have to try dessert another time. But definitely will come back.

I had several holiday parties to attend and this one was in the Wall Street area. The restaurant is located in the ThompsonHotel. This is an Italian restaurant that has great ambiance that makes you feel as if you could be in Italy. The service was outstanding. We had a special pre-fix menu that contained food from the regular menu.

What I liked most was that you did not need to ask for anything, the wait staff was there at every turn to remove plates, refill the wine and water, etc. The hostess was bubbly and made sure that everyone was having a good time. The meal was served family style and we had ample food for the group of 14.

The appetizers we shared was the Arnancini- breaded saffron risotto balls, mozzarella and sun dried tomatoes. Caprese Salad, Artichoke Salad , beets, avocado, sliced almonds, parmigiana and basil dressing.

My entree was the salmon which was pan-seared with sautéed broccoli and sun-dried tomato pesto. There was also a choice of a sliced sirloin steak, Fettuccine Alla Bolognese, Fusilli with tomato sauce and creamy Burrata. For desert I had the chocolate gelato although there was a also a choice of Tiramisu and Pumpkin Cheesecake.

There menu offers a lot of choices and they have a nice wine selection. They offer a nice house wine although for red we chose bottles of 2016 Kith & Kin which was a Cabernet Sauvignon from the Napa Valley. The restaurant charged a fair price of $80. You can purchase the bottle retail for anywhere from $27 to $35. The wine was great and we went through a number of bottles. We really didn't drink the white and had 1 bottle of Meroi which was a 2016 Sauvignon from Italy. We paid $60 and you can purchase the white at retail for about $25.

This was a great experience, even though it is the hotel it was a comfortable, non-rushed experience. We spent about 4 hours there and the time just flew. I would recommend Felice for a great night out.

We came for dinner on Friday night and we loved everything about it . The food, the drinks, the atmosphere and the service were all fantastic . The manager Flavio was very attentive and took wonderful care of us. His food and wine suggestions were on point and left us with the desire to come back very soon.
We felt transported back in Italy and wished we had such an amazing restaurant in LA!

Location is very low key. I was not expecting such an intimate vibe, but was pleasantly surprised. In terms of food, I can only speak for the arancini and the fusilli with burrata dish which were both fine.

One small thing to keep in mind though is, if you're trying be healthy and substituting for whole wheat pasta, you'll get a whole wheat linguine and not the homemade fusilli-- the same probably goes for the other pasta dishes as well.

The food is excellent. The crostini was delicious with "crushed burrata ".  They have their own brand of wine, they let you taste, it was excellent. We had a really great waitress. The hostess was accommodating since we forgot to make reservations.

Love this place. Got in to NY on a Sunday night about 8pm and checked into the Gild Hall hotel (which is very nice) and wanted to eat a good meal but didn't want to get over stuffed so late at night, and also didn't want to wander around lower Manhattan to find one.

Sat at the bar and had a 1/2 order of pasta and side of broccolini and it was the most perfect meal.  Great atmosphere and vibe.

Felice is the restaurant/bar at the Gild Hall Hotel in lower Manhattan.  After a full day out and about our family met up with friends who live in NYC at the bar while waiting for our reservation to eat in the restaurant.  Bartender and wait staff very accommodating and attentive.  Drinks were top shelf .   When we sat down to eat in the restaurant the waiter was very thorough and attentive.  The soup of the day was lentil soup which if I'm not mistaken was vegan which was even better.  Best lentil soup I've ever had in a Restaurant.  The portion is big enough for a meal in itself with a nice piece of bread!  For my main I ordered the Fettuccine alla Bolognese...which was very good!  Simple dish but very good!  This place was a perfect respite after a long day out in the city.  If you ever stay at The Gild Hall or are in the area I highly recommend this restaurant, 5 stars

Fantastic Italian spot if you're in the area. Wine selection is more than reasonable on choice and price. Staff is super friendly and the place has a great vibe. Got the gnocchi which were out of this world. They have a really nice room upstairs which I assume could be rented out for a private event. All in all would visit again, not much to be said about a place that did it all right.

For aesthetics alone, this place is 5 stars. You walk in and the walls are bookshelves with actual books on them and the walls are also lined with bottles of wine. Two of my favorite things in the world. The books are also removable, I may have fiddled with them because there is nothing I hate more than fake bookshelves. The wine was not removable. I came here for my company's Christmas party before the holidays and we had the entire top floor and private room to ourselves. It was really nicely set up. The bar had available a few wines and beers as well as open bar for us to imbibe in. I really enjoyed the red wine that was selected.

Our dinner was first served with two rounds of appetizers. Not going to lie, I was almost pretty much full after the appetizer round. Veal meatballs, baked eggplant in tomato sauce, arancini, burrata, some kind of deep fried chickpea fritter. Not sure if I'm forgetting anything but all solid. Really liked the chickpea thing and the eggplant and meatballs. The arancini was alright but could be cheesier. For the next course we were given the option of penne in a tomato sauce or ravioli with spinach and ricotta in a brown butter sage sauce. Regrets on not going with the ravioli because the penne was just fine. For the secondi we had the choice of salmon and chicken milanese. I went with the salmon and it was perfectly cooked but again, regrets on not going with the chicken because that was the largest slab of meat I've seen in a minute. I tried a bite and it was super flavorful. Salmon was also very tender and nice.

The shining star out of everything though was the desert. Everything was just a-okay tasting until I had the Tortino di Gianduia. Chocolate hazelnut cake surprise whatever. It tasted like I was eating a giant Ferrero Rocher ball. The gelato was also amazing tasting as I merrily ate away at my coworker's abandoned ice cream. I had a flight the next morning and couldn't move or breathe. Passed out like a fat baby. But will say, the shining points were the appetizers and desert for me.

This place was very beautiful, they have a very nice layout and the tables are great. The pasta was very delicious, but the Gnocchi sauce eventually became overpowering. Although I will say it was very well cooked. The service was okay, the waiter did forget to bring out one of the appetizers we ordered but we became full with the pastas so we didn't further mention it, but it would've been nice to try.

Solid American Italian restaurant with a nice bar area. Happy hour is only available at the bar. I didn't see upstairs but the downstairs felt a bit crammed even though we had a nice corner table. The bar area is really nice and had a extensive cocktail menu and wine list.

We started with a chicken liver crostini, which was the highlight for me but skip if you're not into mushy pates. We had 3 pasta dishes that were well seasoned and not as al dente as some other restaurants. I got the linguine with seafood, which had a good mix of fish, calamari, mussels and scallops. It was a rich tomato sauce. The pasta texture itself was ok, not as good as some of the homemade pasta places. Good rose choices on the drinks menu. Overall pretty solid.

Thank you Francisco, Emily and Luigi for the best night with my parents. I've been to the UES location but tonight's meal knocked my socks off. I came for Restaurant Week but discovered what's now one of my all time faves in NYC.

We had the arancini, mussels, calamari to start. The ingredients were so fresh and well executed. Listen people just come here for the calamari. It's a religious experience.

Last time I was so happy from a meal was Gramercy Tavern.

Sundays 25% entire wine bottles. We had a bottle Lambrusco that was divine.

We used to like this place.
But recent experience has been very disappointing. We ordered lasagna. First the dish came out was cold in the middle; so it was not freshly made. Instead of making a new one, they simply microwave it and give us back the same one. Lastly, they never apologize for it. It feels like it is our fault for ordering the cold lasagna.

The quality of both service and food is very bad.
Will never go there myself. And I don't recommend anyone to go there unless you want a cold lasagna.

Felice was absolutely amazing. We were able to walk in without a reservation on Saturday night and get a table for 4. The ambiance is wonderful, and the service was prompt and friendly. I had the best Caprese salad of my life (still thinking about it a day later). The two pastas I tried were also incredible (Carbonara and Gnocchi with mushrooms/truffle oil). My friends loved their meals as well. Highly recommend, cannot wait to go back the next time I am in NYC. Favorite meal of the entire trip, hands down.

First time come here on a Thursday not too busy which mean perfect time not waiting for too long but been waiting over 45min and the foods still not come out yet.
Service is good not too much to complain, serving water and appetizers while waiting for some tiny meatballs $16 and $25 for pasta that's enough for 1 person. Paying 50$ for some uncooked pasta took me 2min and I got out of the restaurant I can't stay here no more the seafood was just shell. This is so over price and I don't know who cook like this and took 45min wait horrible experience

My boyfriend introduced me to this restaurant. We had dinner twice here and it was a positive experience both times. During my first time here, we were lucky enough to dine here without a reservation since the place wasn't super busy. Another time, we didn't make a reservation and the wait was 45 minutes so we didn't bother waiting. For the second time dining here, I made sure to reserve a table and I did via OpenTable app.

The entrees that I have tried were:
1) Pappardelle con Salsiccia- Probably my favorite entree that I have tried so far. The entree comes with sweet Italian sausage, braised endive, mushrooms, herbs, and truffle oil. It was delicious and filling.
2) Ravioli della Casa- It's homemade ravioli with spinach and ricotta filling. The ravioli was pretty fresh and tasty. There were a couple of pieces of ravioli, but I didn't feel full after eating this entree. I guess I should have asked for more bread to help fill me up.

Overall, service was fine. The restaurant could be noisy at times tho. I also recommend making reservations just in case. This place is a good option for Italian food in the FiDi area.

I had the opportunity to go to Felice to grab a cup of coffee with a former Professor on a Friday afternoon. After living in the area for about four years I had never had the opportunity to experience Felice beforehand. I'm so astounded that I didn't because this spot is definitely A+. From the decor to the service, it was an all around great experience.

After arriving there around 5:30 PM I was instantly seated at a table within the bar section of the restaurant. There was only one other party of two there but I credited that to it being a rainy day, as well as that this spot is located in a hotel. By the time I left though the bar was packed and they had switched over to their evening services. I think you're good coming here at anytime and don't think there's a need to make a reservation in advance.

When it came to order I ended up having two cups of coffee, each around $3. They were quick to serve and also asked if I wanted a refill. I appreciated how attentive they were without being overbearing. This is definitely a good, quiet spot to catch up with a friend over coffee if you're in Fidi.

I definitely would recommend Felice to anyone looking for a guaranteed relaxing time! Their main restaurant looks great too! Hopefully I'll get a chance to write a review for that in the near future!

Solid wine and pasta spot in FiDi. The service was good and attentive. The pasta dishes were cooked al dente and the atmosphere is good for chatting because it's not too loud. The candlelight adds a nice touch and it seems like it would be a good date spot, I went with a friend and it was nice too. The place is more spacious than you'd think from the outside as it has a whole upstairs floor. The cocktails sounded nice too but we ended up sticking with reds. The wine menu was fairly extensive and divided by white, red, or rose then by geography.

As a FIDI resident, this review is long overdue.  Service is personalized & attentive.  Every dish I've tried tastes homemade & made to perfection.  I always feel at home when dining at Felice.  Thank you to the staff, & especially for the beautiful birthday acknowledgement.

Tucked away in Wall Street we dined late Saturday night and it was empty. Loved the intimacy and the entire staff. We weren't rushed and the food arrived as ordered in a timely fashion.

The rice balls were great.
Salmon was good.
Branzino was good. I would have liked a little more cauliflower.
Minestrone soup was very good.

I'd visit again if we were staying at the hotel. Loved the staff and would love to try a few different entrees next time to enjoy some of their homemade recipes.

My friends and I came in on a Sunday for brunch and had an awesome time! I had made a reservation for 11:30am but the restaurant was pretty empty when we got there so I think we would have been fine without it.

The restaurant is beautifully decorated and the service we received from our server as well as all the other staff was great! They bring out bread for the table to start, which is always a great touch. It was soft and warm and perfectly crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.

Their brunch entrees each come with a complimentary bellini or mimosa which is fantastic! One of my friends and I each ordered a different toast to split and share with each other because we both couldn't decide on one. We got the French toast and the avocado toast. Both were equally awesome! The avocado toast tasted fresh and came with 2 poached eggs on top as well as a nice salad on the side. The French toast is made with raisin brioche toast topped with strawberries, blueberries and powdered sugar. They also give you maple syrup on the side. It was a perfect meal of savory and sweet toasts.

In the end we couldn't resist their dessert menu and got a gelato sundae with cookie pieces, nuts, chocolate sauce, and dipped cream to share for the table. Amazing!

Overall a great experience, and prices were super reasonable for the food and drink you got. Definitely an awesome spot to grab brunch in fidi, I'll be back soon!

Good wine bar for downtown, I had better time at
The bar than the date. A bar had a separate than the restaurant. They have a whole bar and lounge area. Good spot downtown, a bit hidden due to construction but good atmosphere. Drink prices were 12-15$ a bit high to bad they had no specials for a Sunday evening. But would come back if needed a spot in the area.
