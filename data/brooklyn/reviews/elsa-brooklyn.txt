Stopped in here the other day. I appreciate the friendly, but regimented seating, and service protocols.

We were greeted warmly on a slow day by the bartender who gave us our choice of seat, after which, a server appeared.

I took a flyer and ordered a frozen painkiller, which had a nice taste to the very end of the drink, having never become diluted or watery; do the use insulated cups?

We also saw that they have aged Manhattan's, I believe.

We will return, with enthusiasm.

I think Elsa is a cute little spot on Atlantic Avenue. I like that on a Friday or Saturday night you can usually walk in and find a table. I also think that they have an interesting drink selection.

My only two recommendations/hesitations with them which is why I gave them four stars instead of five is the fact that sometimes I find their drinks overpriced for the quality of the drink. The additional reason I knocked off one star is that sometimes I find the staff to be not especially friendly or helpful. I understand they are in a neighborhood where image can be very important but I think that being kind is never lost on the people who are coming to your establishment to spend money.

Saturday 5pm. 5 friends (+ baby sleeping in stroller).

Loved the decor and ambiance of this place. The bathroom...is a designer's dream. I would come here over and over again. We are some old and new friends meeting up from various parts of the city (and from out of town) in this cozy yet stylish bar on Atlantic Ave. The front is unassuming but the bar goes back fairly far and there is open seating with low tables and stools that feels pretty private. It was perfect as we rolled the sleeping baby into facing the corner wall as we all got to catch up.

Drinks were very good and service was great too! I'll be back to try the food and more cocktails.

Drinks - not bad, pretty good
Price - alright, decent, price pretty acceptable tbh
Atmosphere - clean, good vibe
Service - there was an sign, wait to be seated, waiting 2-3 min and the bartender realized we were standing there and then they get the service ti sit us down. Lack of attention maybe?
Dress code - people there dress pretty business casual kinda thing.

Over good experience, if you by yourself looking for an place to have a drink or two, no. Not here. Its loud, and you will need an friend to be here with you, not a great place to be left along and enjoy your "alone" time if u get what i mean. So yeah , bring an friend if you visiting this place.

If you like old fashion like i do, this place is not bad, $10 buck. But of course they other drinks too peep

What a wonderful cocktail bar!

Came here based on a recommendation and I'm in love.

First of all this bar is BEAUTIFUL. Has a French modern art deco feel to it. I think this is the prettiest cocktail bar I've ever been to. The interior is elegant, with a lot of neutral colors, especially whites and creams and cozy lights. The atmosphere is fantastic.
Cozy booths and tables in the midst of everything and some quite tables in the back.
Even the bathroom is gorgeous!!

Great cocktails and great service. Quality drinks and some talented bar tenders.
My favorite was the 'two French sisters' it's light, citrusy and a little sweet - amazing cocktail!! It's vodka and orange based and topped with champagne.
I would skip the glassine stamp. It was extremely bitter.
The 24k gold was delicious and comes in a mug.
Seriously the cocktails are too notch!

A few snacks like nuts and olives, but really not much food around here.

Definitely in the top 5 of my favorite bars in NYC

There is one thing about the food/drink service industry that I will never understand: why do people who hate other people seek jobs in bars and restaurants?

An example of this is the staff at Elsa. The hostess doesn't even smile or say 'hello' - weird, but ok. The grey-haired man with a ponytail, wire-frame glasses and a dirty Joy Division t-shirt however, is a whole new level of rude. He is the quintessential awful New York bartender - blaze, uninterested, depressed, too-good-to-be-nice, frustrated, getting-old-and-still-working-at-a-bar, I'm-getting-my-tip-anyway creature.

I don't understand why people like that want to work in hospitality. But what's even more confusing is why owners/managers don't recognize that awful service can ruin an experience.

An extra star for a wonderful design and good vibe (created by patrons, not staff.)

Stopped by Elsa after dinner on a Thursday early evening and it was pretty busy on the inside! We got seated quickly but the remaining tables quickly got filled after us.
The decor is awesome and the vibe feels good. The happy hour had good prices and would definitely recommend the wine punch! We didn't have other drinks but just wanted to check the place out. The back area seems like an amazing place to hold an event and something I'll think of in the future.
I was in between a 4 and 5 stars due to the service speed. When we stopped by, we weren't really looking to stay for more than one drink so we didn't care for much service, but it did seem a little slow. Hoping the next time we go that this slow service isn't a constant.

It gets 3 stars for being a totally gorgeous bar. The bathroom is stupidly lovely, and the light fixtures and seating are so pretty.

Cocktail wise, pretty good. Not always a 10/10, but a good variety and interesting flavors.

The reason for two missing stars is the staff. They seem a bit cold and pretentious. It was strange, just a couple of unfriendly bartenders really ruined things for us. And this isn't the first time I've experienced this.

It's a sexy spot, but the bartenders could be a bit more warm if they want people to come back.

Really awesome cocktail bar!  We came here at ~8pm on a Friday evening and were able to get seats (but some of the last ones).  Service was great, drinks even better.  I had a Vivian Darkbloom and Death of a Ladies Man -- both were absolutely delicious in different ways, reasonably boozy, and a fair deal given normal NYC cocktail prices.  I also sampled the other 5 drinks my friends had, and all were also delicious in unique ways.

We'll definitely be going back!

I went to Elsa on Friday evening with a couple of my friends (Girls night out). This spot couldn't be cuter. The white and black interior is polka dotted with art, and has big spanning booth. It's a clean retro design.

Cocktails are definitely on the expensive side, but not any more than NYC standards. It's worth it to sip and chat with friends for a while. Me and one friend had the Two French Sisters, and my other friend had the Handsome Grandson. The Two French Sisters is a vodka, St. Germain, Champagne drink, not as much of that "cocktail look" as the other one, but tasted very fresh. I sipped the Handsome Grandson and it was fruitier.

The cocktails here are artful concoctions that you can't find anywhere else. They taste delicious, and interesting - not trying too hard by putting too many flavors in one glass.

A nice place to dress up and go out with the ladies!

Such a cool bar. We celebrated a friend's birthday here and had a whole section blocked off all to ourselves. It was perfect! I love the aesthetic of this place- the bathrooms are selfie worthy. I loved every drink I tasted, two French sisters, the golden fang, the handsome grandson, and the painkiller (like a refreshing pina colada). I think my favorite drink though is unfortunately one I don't remember the name to and can't find on the menu pictures it had coconut in it and came in a little tea cup. Would order this 5x order and be a drunken mess for sure. The wait staff was excellent and they stored an ice cream cake in their freezer for us. Overall a great way to spend an evening in

Elsa has a great vibe - the decor is up to date and very comfortable to relax for a quick beverage, which is exactly what we did.

The bar staff was a bit non-chalant and weren't the BIGGEST helps on drink decisions, but I settled on the self-portrait.  It was amazingly delicious.  The cilantro tequila and habanero combined to form a spicy yet punchy pop when drinking this delightful concoction.

We were one and done on this trip; my friend had an average old fashioned - but it was a great stop.  I highly recommend to anyone in the neighborhood.

Oh so many people packed here on a Saturday night. Luckily my friend reserved a table in the back for us otherwise you can still hang by the bar.

This place is super romantic but not quiet or fancy dress up place. You can come in Jean and t-shirt but if you want to impress that date, you should make a little effort. I don't see any food on the menu but there are a couple pizzaria around the corner or Mediterranean food.

Drinks. They make some mean stuff. All broken down in the categories like gin, whiskey or rum and on and on. I enjoyed their gin section  Happy hour is 5 to 7pm with like 6 to 7 option for half the price. Beside that, it will be the typical NYC price for drinks. I still can't rationalize the cost of alcohol. If I go down this road, this whole review page will be about that. Anyway, the drink comes with funny names which you can read on the attached image.

Service is great and remember to tip well.

Grabbed drinks at Elsa late on a Friday night. The style is all there, but I just was not crazy about the quality of the drinks.

Quality: Elsa was a few stops into the night, so I was not in the mood for my own cocktail. I went with a local IPA and it was a solid choice. I did however get a few sips of Perfume-V, which is tequila, creme de violette, St. Germain, egg white, lemon, and rose water. It sounded and looked better than it tasted. I got the impression from my group that was the case across the board. Pretty and intriguing, but not that great.
Quantity: Standard pours for both beers and cocktails.
Value: Cocktails range from $12 to $16. Beers fall between $5 and $9.
Ambiance: Elsa is a cocktail bar located along Atlantic Ave in Brooklyn. I think the space looks much more like a brunch spot than a cocktail bar, and maybe that is why the crowd looked similar. Following the modern farmhouse decor style that is so popular, the space combines industrial and rustic elements into a chic design. The shape and color of the walls with the yellow glowing lights give this vague feeling that you are on an airplane or train from back in time. The music however is current pop hits, knocking you out of that illusion.
Crowd: Very busy on Friday night. The stylish bar brings in a young, hip crowd.
Service: We were a larger group and I appreciated how the staff went out of their way to accommodate us. However, once we sat down, it was very tough to catch someone's eye.
Parking: Difficult to find a street spot in the area.

Came here on a whim while walking around on a nice night from Henry st after having a bizarre encounter with a new acquaintance. I felt like the night needed to end on a good note. I trickled into this place for a last glass for the night. I'm so glad I did! I walked in and was instantly pleased with the aesthetic of the bar. It has a very chic, modern, Art Deco lay out. The bartender was nice and pleasant. He welcomed me and even laughed at my previous experience elsewhere. The drinks are really decently priced.  They have booths as well as bar seating throughout the bar, so no lack of seating here. The bathrooms are very picturesque worthy as they have a studio feel, perfect for those IG ops. But don't hog them up, because they're unisex and only 2 available - so be considerate. The ambiance is grown and laid back - perfect for those quiet nights over convo and good drinks!

Love great discoveries. Especially in the form of a cozy bar with great drinks. Didn't have much of the bites offered besides the cheese plate. Had 3 different cocktails though which were fantastic. Service was also on point with our server giving great recommendations and always nearby. Will return!

I'm going to try my best not to make a Frozen joke.

What's no joke is Elsa's cocktail program. It's truly next level, and one of the best I've seen in Brooklyn, if not all of NYC. Makes sense with their pedigree (Elsa was previously in the East Village, and their sister bar is the renowned Ramona in Greenpoint). Elsa exudes creativity in spades and doesn't take it self overly seriously like some other cocktail bars.

I will go on record that the Harpooned Heart is one of the best cocktails I've had in a long, long time. Sure, it's served in a tiki mug, but there's no shame in that. Vodka, coconut, almond, vanilla, mint, lime, pineapple, and peppercorn bitters. OH, and it's garnished with a goddamn Ferrero Raffaello! Are you trying to get into my pants, Elsa?

My second drink was the Handsome Grandson, which was a light gin drink with basil. Well balanced and dangerously crushable.

I also tried the Self Portrait, which was a great, spicy tequila drink with cilantro. Strong and delicious.

They also do vinegar shrubs (which sounds like a Pokemon item), but is actually drinking vinegar mixed with alcohol and spices. You can get gin, vodka, or tequila. It kind of tastes like a pickleback (on account of the dill), but way more complex than that. You get some spice with the jalapeno, and some sweetness with the mango/pineapple. Definitely worth trying, as I don't think I've ever had anything like it.

The space is beautiful. It used to be Last Exit (with whom I've had a... history). But they've completely gut renovated the old dive bar into something beautiful. Very art deco, like something out of a World's Fair poster or from Ayn Rand cover art. Whoever designed the place really put amazing thought into it. Just one of the small things I noticed was that the booth tables were built with alcohol lamps in mind. There's also a railing of light bisecting the entire length of the bar, like train tracks. There's what appear to be hand blown glass lighting fixtures. Oh, and the bathroom is gorgeous. Without exaggeration, one of the coolest bathrooms ever. Mirrored on all sides and well lit. Might I say, selfie bait?

The place is also deceptively large. There's a back area, and they have a patio!

We came here on the Sunday of Labor Day, and it was a surprisingly big crowd (even saw people getting there in Ubers). So I imagine it's even more busy on a regular weekend. I can see them eating Long Island Bar's lunch since their cocktails are better and the space/drinks are way more Instagrammable. If only they served more food than just meat and cheese from Stinky's!

Oh, and speaking of Frozen, they also do frozen cocktails. That doesn't count as a joke.

Solid cocktails in a fun looking place.

Prices are so-so for decent cocktails. Ranging from $13-16/each, which is affordable for the amount of liquor they contain. Honestly 2 was plenty for me, and I do drink enough. That being said - it was worth the overall cost, but my wallet wouldn't let me frequent this place.

Service was slow and slightly rude. A bunch of people were working, not sure where the slowdown was, but it took a good 15 minutes to order a drink - and that was with nobody else waiting ahead of me. Was not impressed by the callous attitude some of the bartenders had, but it is fitting for the atmosphere of this place... arrogance and cocktails probably just go together¯\_(ツ)_/¯

To the drinks I had: Glassine Stamp was tasty, as was their Old Fashioned. I'd definitely order either one again.

Excellent bar! I came by while waiting for a table at a nearby restaurant and was not disappointed. Their old fashioned is $10, which is great for a nice cocktail spot. It tasted very refreshing and citrusy (comes with both orange and lemon peel). I also tried the Forever Ever IPA (on draught) which was delicious! It might be unfiltered, and has notes of pine and citrus and is very refreshing.

The atmosphere is awesome! There are funky lights everywhere and mini booths that are comfortable. I'd love to come back and try many of their cocktails and appetizers.

My husband and I came to this cocktail bar to have a relaxed nightcap after our weekly dinner date. He was very sure that I would love the place and boy was he right!! I had a GREAT MEZCAL DRINK called Vivian Darkbloom! I was afraid the bitters would be too over powering but it was not, it was perfect!! Now, my favorite part was the bathroom! I am a sucker for a well thought-out bathroom and this was definitely delivered!! The candles had an amazing fragrance with some earthy wood smells to it (I even took a picture of the candle to buy it for my apartment!) and the ceiling was an impressive mirror arch! (My photo does not do it justice!) I highly recommend this place as a well-rounded cocktail bar!!

I'm trying this new thing where I don't drink until I start yelling at inanimate objects anymore. Elsa is both good and bad for this new me.

On the one hand, the cocktails are actually fantastic, which makes me want to have 7-12 of them. But on the other, they all cost between $10-$16, which necessarily limits the number I can have because I'm poor.

Unfortunately for Moderation March (as I have dubbed this endeavor), Elsa's space is so goddamn gorgeous that I want to move in. And if I'm going to live here, I'm probably going to do a bunch of drinking. (How else am I supposed to pass the time? The cell service in here is terrible.)

Seriously, this room is fantastic. If you'd never been to Last Exit (the previous tenant), please believe me when I say that place was basically a toilet of a bar that had a decent backyard. By contrast, Elsa is bright, sleek, and tasteful. They did not skimp on the renovation. Are those light fixtures hand-blown? The pink accents on the leather booths (a surprising amount of comfortable seating in here) are also leather? There's a full on mirrored tunnel in the bathroom?!

The only thing more beautiful than the reno is the cocktail program. There isn't a single option on this menu that I don't want to try. Having had a few already, I can report that they taste as good as they sound. Whether you're a whiskey, gin, vodka, or agave spirit drinker, there's something here that you're going to like:

The Two French Sisters reminds me of champagne brunches in New Orleans (at the Court of Two Sisters). The Black Book is a spicy selection reminiscent of a hot toddy, but drinkable all year long. The Golden Fang is a pink drink that makes me feel like more of a man (no mean feat).

Overall, Elsa moving into our neighborhood feels serendipitous. Not only did my wife and I used to live right by their old location in Alphabet City, but a few of our friends (also now in this part of Brooklyn) did as well. All of us gathering here for a few cocktails after work feels like coming home.

Three minor complaints:

1. I wish they had more food beyond the small snacks (olives, nuts, cheese).
2. A happy hour would go a long way toward letting me pay my mortgage.
3. One of my friends said their candles looked like a diaphragm. Which led to a lengthy discussion of why he knows what a diaphragm looks like, the logistics of using a diaphragm, and so forth. I could've done without that.

But other than that, I couldn't be happier to have them in the hood.

I really wanted to review this place better because their cocktails are great. Our server was horrible. She carried every drink in hand, spread fingers so her prints were all over our glasses. It was busy, understood, but they should probably put another server on as it took us forever to get another drink order in it took me 28 minutes to be recognized, order, and receive my order. She was unfriendly, and it seemed like we inconvenienced her every time we ordered. We actually waived another server over and when I ordered he told me they didn't have lime juice (huh? most of their cocktails have lime juice in it), I told him I'm sure they did and true enough he returned with my drink. THEN she never told me she included gratuity on the check (which by itself Is ILLEGAL), so I double tipped!!!! Heading home I looked at my receipt and realized. I will never be returning. What a shame it's actually a beautiful a space.

These cocktails are seriously amazing. Depending on my mood, aka do I want to pay $5-8 for a happy hour standard old fashioned, sazarac, beer, or wine, OR do I want one of their signature libations from heaven at $13plus is my on going debate. All our good. But I can't find a drink that I stick with ONLY because I know the next one will surprise me with splendor. Portrait stands out currently as a go to. Vibe is chill, music is good, service is on point. Wish they had more food options but I get it. Love having Elsa in the hood.

Super cute place with an amazing cocktail menu. We got the aperol spritz, Hotel danger, the golden fang, and the red wine. All very good- would recommend the Golden Fang. Not a lot of food options if that's what you're looking for

Still the best cocktail bar on Atlantic

Love the use of vinegar in their "shrub" drinks. They pack a punch with a unique taste that is often lost with many modern day cocktail bars.

I am a frequent customer here and so should you! They offer a laid back atmosphere with hints of retro nostalgia. The bartenders know what they are doing and will provide you with great guidance on the drink that best suits your palette.

Naturally, this place can be busy on Thursday/Friday with space limited. The wait is worth it but if you are looking for a less hectic first experience, opt for Monday-Wednesday.

What took me soo long....

I can't believe that was the first time I visited this amazing cocktail spot on Atlantic...

At first I was a bit concerned that this could be a trap. Could this be a spot for would be hipsters to congregate and discuss the latest apple product or could this be a legitimate cocktail bar? Thankfully the latter prevailed and Elsa is a hit!

The bartenders are friendly and make a damn good drink! The atmosphere is a throwback that infuses art deco aesthetics mixed with solid mood lighting...

This might have to be my new spot!!

When I heard there was a new Elsa Schiaparelli inspired bar in the hood, I put it on the top of my list of places to try! I planned a happy hour with 3 other girlfriends, meeting here during a week day around 5:30. There was a decent amount of groups seated, but it was also no problem to get a table. The inside was beautiful, as expected, with little nods to the designer. The bathroom, which my friend described as looking like a "futuristic space ship" was probably the best room in the bar!! They also had an outdoor patio filled with people which is a nice feature as well!
The happy hour deals were pretty good, with one white, red, and rose wine discounted as well as some beers. Our biggest problem with the place was the staff. As in, there was ONE server for all the tables inside and out it appeared. So it was frustrating trying to get drinks, and frustrating how long we had to wait for check after asking twice. It's probably not the servers fault, as it was clearly an owners staffing issue problem, but it was enough for us to leave with negative feelings towards the bar. Which is disappointing as it had so much potential in the area.

Elsa is like stepping back into time, when men wore suits, subways took tokens, leather booths were white, and bartenders could mix a stiff drink with just enough showmanship to earn their tip.

They make a mean Sazerac. If you don't know what is, they're $7 during happy hour and you should just order one based on a lackluster Yelp review.

Elsa? No Anna here. Oh Frozen references! That's how I think about this fantastic cocktail bar in Clinton Hill but it is also entirely related.

Came here on a whim after trekking through all of Brooklyn Bridge Park with a friend and being dehydrated, we were seeking beverages to cool us down and after passing by places shook our heads no to, Elsa was beacon of cocktail coolness.

For about $10-$18 each cocktail, there is a bevy of options to choose from whatever your drink preference is from the classics, gin, rum, whisky, rum, absinthe, beer, wine, and other spirits. Due to the blazing summer weather, we were thinking maybe a beer but the sign in front of the bar had FROZEN DRINKS. Considering my friend and I were seeing mirages before we arrived at Elsa, we went for the frozen section and ordered the Contortionist Jazz Exotica which was a twist of the Salted Watermelon Rose & Black Pepper Moscow Mule plus a Montauk watermelon ale.

The Exotica has got to be the best frozen cocktail I've had ever. The black pepper in the moscow mule gave it a little kick and the salt in the watermelon rose elevated the sweetness of the watermelon. It's what summer drinks are made of. The minor quibble I have with Elsa is their selection of snacks which is a mere cheese/charcuterie plate, olives, and roasted nuts. Not much to choose from so hoping they expand the menu a bit more in the future.

The outdoor patio is gorgeous from the brief look of it from up above. It is a spacious space and it gets crowded. Service was great with a cool laid back atmosphere. There is a happy hour too from Monday to Friday if you're ever in the area and want a drink. Elsa is a standout cocktail bar for sure.

Happy drinking and remember: Don't deny, satisfy!

One of my favorite cocktail bars in the neighborhood! The service and drinks are excellent. Great spot for meeting up with your girlfriends, date nights, or a night to yourself. Highly recommend the Two French Sister cocktail drink - refreshingly addicting! The bathroom is what you call an "instragramable" spot. The mirrors were a little bizarre for my taste but still a spectacle.

Despite a wealth of Yelp reviews written in the days when I still lived in Providence, RI, I haven't felt compelled to speak my piece on any establishment since moving to the city some years ago. Most of the buzzed-about haunts and must-visit locales in New York have been complimented, critiqued, and crusaded against to a degree that made my particular two-cents arguably superfluous. Yet my experience at Elsa, the latest libation destination in the Cobble Hill area, was so superb, that I felt compelled- perhaps, obligated- to sing their praises.

The decor of the bar, for starters, is the increasingly ubiquitous collision of clean, modern lines, coupled with such antiquated features as candles, exposed piping, and lamps that harken to a previous era. The design is featured at many newer bars in the city, yet Elsa manages to make the idea unique, and avoids the faux pas of appearing to be a cliché. The mirrored theme throughout executed equally flawlessly, and is an attractive feature in the bathrooms in particular.

However, the real star of the show has to be the beverage program, which is thoughtful, creative, and most importantly, diverse - bars too often craft their programs whilst leaning excessively on one or two spirits; here, the menu was diverse, and desired extensive options for lovers of any liquor variation. Every cocktail I ordered was expertly crafted by my tender of bar, Keegan in this case.

Not only do I recommend this bar to anyone who may reside in the area; any self-respecting enthusiast of mixology would do well to visit as soon as possible.
