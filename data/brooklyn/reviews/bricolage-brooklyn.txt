In these times where outdoor dining is key, it's nice to find a place with as creative a backyard patio as Bricolage. Filled with plants and shelves lined with old-school portable TVs, it's quirky and lush all at the same time.
We came for brunch. The service was great, the staff very friendly, and they were mindful of COVID and the heat, making sure we were comfortable.
The food was awesome. Start with their Crispy Imperial Rolls. Then roll onto their Chicken & Waffles, which doesn't lack crisp or flavor. There's a layer of seasoning/sauce between the breading and chicken that takes it to new levels. Around our table, the Breakfast Bahn Mi, Pork Belly Hash, and the Avocado Toast all got a thumbs up too.
Will definitely be back for their dinner service soon.
Please support your local businesses!

One of the best outdoor dining experiences you can get during these COVID times - the worst part is how popular it is! We came on a Friday night around 6pm and had to wait until 7 to get seated so I would recommend making a reservation or coming right when it opens. However, if you have the time, I would say the food and dining experience was well worth the wait.

Here are the items we tried:

Drinks (not pictured):
- Thai-basil lemonade: 4.5/5 - Much more sour than sweet but very fresh and balanced the food well
- The Stroller: 5/5 - Delicious, sweet, and fruity!

Mains:
- Unshaking beef: 5/5 - Hands down my favorite item we ate. It was an enormous piece of steak that was perfect for sharing between 2 people (definitely would have had leftovers if I ordered it for myself) and came with a bowl of rice and tangy salad that complemented the steak perfectly.
- Spice garlic noodles: 4/5 - Both my friend and I thought this was too spicy for our taste (as people who can take mild-moderate spice) but the flavor of the noodle and shrimp were amazing. The portion was also a bit small.

Dessert:
Five spice plum cobbler: 3.5/5 - The homemade matcha ice cream had such a deep authentic flavor but it was not sweet at all, which didn't help counter the tartness of the plums. The crumb was a little sweeter but I wasn't really a fan of the texture either. However, this may just be my personal taste - if you like your desserts on the less sweet side, you may enjoy this!

Overall, an amazing experience and I definitely would come back again.

Visited during covid/quarantine times.

Was walking in the neighborhood and the outdoor decor lured me in. Ordered the avocado toast with poached egg  and breakfast bahn. Also got two mimosas. The mimosa were tasty. Not too strong and a bit on the sweet side. The service is great. The food took a little while but we weren't in any rush so we didn't mind. They have a couple of outdoor seating.

The avocado toast was amazing. The pickled carrots were a great added taste. The breakfast bahn was also great but it wasn't filling.

The prices were a bit much for a small amount of bahn.

Would love to come to this place once dinning services are back up and running.

I've been fortunate enough to enjoy the superior food, thoughtfully and imaginatively (in the non-"Six Degrees of Separation" Will Smith thesis on "Catcher in the Rye" way) crafted cocktails, urbane environment, cool ambience, well-lit brick-walled space, balmy outdoor seating area, and excellent kitchen staff at Bricolage.  The waitstaff, however, deserves special attention.  Having worked in the hospitality and service industries since, well, the age of 7, it's my opinion that everyone in America should work in one, the other, or both.  For the servers to be able to navigate such a narrow passageway as the bar area (the only real, but un-fixable as of my too-long-ago last visit issue) with nimble and smiling dexterity is a feat worthy of the New York City Ballet.  Pas de Calais took less time to plan.

The fact that they BEGAN with a chef from the fabled Slanted Door in San Francisco (which I've visited many times) says a lot about the vision, gravitas, and creativity with which the owners infused their venture and the menu. There were no retreads from that famous bill of fare.  New flavors, less precious menu, and palpable energy for the collaboration pours over the palate.  Every time I went the joint was slammed but the atmosphere was convivial, whether you wanted a warm glow for a romantic evening or a solid neighborhood (or destination) spot for a group gathering.  Rather like Caf√© Le Procope in Paris, in a way.  The restaurant business is a tough one, and only profitable if scaled.  So this is a successful labor of love. Yet the partners generously give their space, treasure, and commitment to local and international philanthropic causes time and time again.  If I were cool enough to live in that part of New York, it would be my Cheers (in the best sense).  But it's worth an equally long journey there from the UES as it was to go to Pastis when it was in its old location.  If ever there were a truly local business with cosmopolitan panache, it was and is Bricolage.  Run, Via, Subway (worth changing trains!), or wheelbarrow yourself there ASAP.  Just save me a table this weekend.  And be sure to "overtip" (that means 25% MINIMUM these days, y'all) your waitstaff and the driver who got you there.

I definitely fell for this place for its cute decor, especially the backyard patio which screamed 'stay here if you want to be warm and cozy.' Here are some good and not-so-great takeaways from my dining experience on a Saturday night:

The good:
- Dining in Park Slope is a nice little adventure no matter what time of day.
- COVID restrictions are taken seriously. You're given hand sanitizer right before you're seated.
- The staff is super friendly and accommodating. Even after closing they let us come back to use the restroom.
- The drinks are great. I had the G-G's Brother, which was a mix of tangy, sweet, and bitter, and left me feeling *good* all through dinner.

The not-so-great:
- My friend and I shared the shrimp claypot. I pictured something really big, but unfortunately it turned out to be a small pot with a few pieces of shrimp, baby Bok Choy, cherry tomato, and scallion. I guess the caramel-chili sauce sealed the deal, but I was not at all impressed by this dish...I guess I'll order something more 'Vietnamese' next time.

I recommend coming here for brunch the first time, since the brunch menu looks a lot more promising than the dinner one. Either way, the drinks, service, and decor were enough to bring me back again.

It's hard to compare Bricolage to any Vietnamese establishment, mainly because it doesn't feel like one. Vietnamese customers, let alone staff, aren't really much of a thing here (#1), but the despite the overly western vibe, the Asian undertones are really exuded through the food. Their contemporary take of Viet inspired cuisine is impressive, just as it is delicious.

Their ties to the famous Slanted Door of SF fame (#2) suddenly make more sense when it comes to their approach. This isn't the homey kitchen with a Viet grandma making bun bo hue or thit kho, but a more high end approach to highlighting Asian flavors through the lens of a western palate.

The casual interior is unintentionally hipster yet the smells coming from the open kitchen is an excellent surprise. They've also beefed up the outdoor seating with an array of beautiful greenery and some interesting retro (#3) decor on top of it. There isn't a ton of seating but they've managed to do a good job to accommodate small'ish groups for some quality dining.

In terms of the food, it's all pretty tasty. The imperial rolls (cha gio) at $15 might feel steep despite "heritage pork" upgrade, and similarly to the summer rolls (goi cuon), the portions are modest at best. The quesadilla sized Vietnamese pancake (banh xeo) is a bit of a sticker shock at $25, but is certainly no less aromatic and full of flavor. The real winner is the fish sauce which is pungent and even a little sweet. While I would venture to the five spice wings ($14) and pork belly buns ($18) admittedly feel gimmicky, they're worth considering for those who love it.

I think my favorite entree is easily the unshaken beef ($33) which is their atypical take on bo luc lac. It is delightfully juicy and as a steak type dish makes any carnivore happily satisfied. I also have high regards for the lemongrass pork chops ($20) and pan seared scallops ($33). The pho bo ($18) and pho ga ($18) are personally less exciting and I'm hoping the cloudy broth was a one time deal.

They also have a brunch that I still have yet to dive into. The thought of eating chicken and waffles at a Vietnamese spot sounds interesting, if not somewhat random, but that's the magic of spots that defy conventional notion. Service is on point and I think for folks looking for something a little different will find it in Bricolage.

Visited during COVID times -

It is a great restaurant for big groups to hold mini gatherings. From start to the end, the staff was very attentive and made sure to give us hand sanitizer before entering the restaurant. There is very instagram worthy backyard that was filled with greenery and old radios. The cocktails were mediocre and it wasn't anything special. My favorite was the roasted chicken and the spring rolls. The chicken was tender and juicy and the spring rolls were crispy and full.

Thank you for the amazing service and making my group feel welcomed!

Such a pleasure eating at this place. Usually a large portion of food already makes me happy, image how happy I am when I get a large portion of the GREATEST FOOD EVER, and especially when the place is so gorgeous. Oh, especially when their servers are the cutest.
I am in totally in love with this place, aiming to try all the food on the menu.

Impeccable staff. Food is tasty but expensive for what you get. Good for the strip. I would go back,  but you can get better for half the price in Chinatown but no cocktails & wine.

My boyfriend and I arrived shortly before the kitchen closed and they were nice enough to allow us to sit as long as we promised to have our order ready for when seated, We happily agreed and were in business . It was my first time at this establishment but definitely won't be the last. I enjoyed everything from the food to the staff. Literally everyone was sooooooo nice and the food was tasty . The bar tender was even kind enough to ask my preference of drink preparation, I ended up going with his recommendation because at this point I felt like family and knew he cared for his work.

I will definitely will be coming back with my girls ‚Äç.

I'm sorry to say that this was a very disappointing experience even with rating leeway given for ordering delivery instead of eating at the restaurant. I can forgive the incorrect bread used for the banh mi and the cold imperial rolls but I haven't had such sudden onset food poisoning since traveling to India. I was guilty about not working out before dinner but I guess Bricolage solved that problem for me. Right now, I don't imagine a universe in which a friend will be begging me to try Bricolage and I'll be placed in a position of compromise. I think if that scenario were to ever arise (given this hellscape of a year, all bets are off as to what could happen), I'd stick to gin at the bar. Two stars back for the flavor of the Brussels sprouts but I still think I'll pass.

One of those places I have passed by a thousand times. I am kicking myself for waiting so long to actually try it. My girlfriend and I were out for a walk and decided to place an order, continue our walk and pick up our food on the way back to our apartment (probably about 20 minute walk away from the restaurant to give a sense of how the food preserved).

I went with the spicy garlic noodles while my gf opted for the shrimp claypot. First indication that this place was great was not only were the staff super friendly but they also were very helpful in making a decision as to what to get, and they were spot on. The food lasted perfectly fine. Hot, fresh, no leakage, happy customers. My chicken dish was incredible. Very fresh and high quality ingredients. Not too overwhelming, but had an amazing garlic flavor with just enough kick. Didn't leave a single bite left. The shrimp was equally as delicious, and again very simple with just the right combination of flavors and heat. Will not be making the mistake of waiting too long for the next time we eat here.

I can not rave about this place enough. Came here for dinner on a weeknight and ate in the plant adorned garden. Service was excellent, drinks were superb and the food was dish after dish of delicious tastiness. We ordered tons of appetizers, a few mains to share and while I was so full by the end of it all, I honestly wanted to try the rest of the menu. This place is that good! You will not be disappointed.
These are the kinds of places that make New York and particularly Brooklyn known for their eats. It's uncompromising in all the elements that matter - delicious food, good vibes, excellent service and comfortable atmosphere.
Thank you for a beautiful evening.

Things we ordered and loved:
Papaya salad
Summer rolls
Imperial rolls - omg amazing!
All the tacos ... seriously amazing
Spicy garlic noodles
Shrimp Claypot
All the desserts - particularly the plum cobbler with the chocolate cake following close behind

10000% RECOMMEND!!! Loved the food, cocktails, service, and conversation from the owners and hosts. We had a massive birthday party last minute AND on a Saturday night (their busiest night) in the middle of a pandemic. Not only did they accommodate the party and give us a massive part of the patio from 7-close, they didn't require any minimum charges or booking fees. The outdoors patio was GORGEOUS, like a piece of paradise. The internal design is masterful, the plants colorful and give the place life. Perfect ambiance for a couple or a large group. We tried almost everything on the menu and everything was GREAT.

They were also extremely helpful in pulling together a surprise for the birthday boy. They organized the candles and took out the cake at the perfect moment to help us celebrate.

Overall, wonderful experience. Highly, highly recommend.

I went there on a Saturday for brunch. The decorations are really cute and this place would make a great daring spot (check the backyard).

HOWEVER, the menu isn't really Vietnamese food. You could says most dishes are classic American dishes with a slight inspiration of Vietnamese cuisine. This is very true for the brunch menu.

We had the pork belly hash and the avocado toast (none of the brunch items are Vietnamese food). The pork lacked cruelly of seasoning and the dish itself was very oily. The avocado toast had some pickled carrots and daikon, for the Vietnamese-inspired part. But the pickles were.... Not pickled long enough.

Also, I asked what was the Vietnamese crepe on the menu. It was a vegan crepe with 2 eggs on top.... Lol

Would not recommend for food but drinks in the back patio is to check (though the drinks looked overpriced... $15).

Bricolage has one of the most incredible backyards I've ever seen. Our three friends and I had an exceptional, gorgeous experience.

Our food was thrilling, top to bottom. Particular highlights were our cocktails: the Thai basil gimlet and the GG boy, the apps, particularly the mushroom wontons, and the garlic noodles.

We would love to eat there again in the future. Two notes: definitely call in to make a reservation in advance, and note there is a time limit on the table (at least on Saturday nights in the backyard), we had to leave our table after an hour and a half.

Decent Vietnamese food in a gastropub setting. The flavors were a bit more muted than traditional Vietnamese food. For example, the Cup of Pho's flavor was mainly salt, rather than the complex broth I'm used to. Additionally, the only detectable flavor in the Papaya Salad was the fried onion condiment.

Despite this, the peanut sauce for the summer rolls was phenomenal! Among one of the best I've had - I wanted to eat it plain with rice at the end. The lemongrass tofu dish was really the only familiar flavors I'm used to at home and my girlfriend said it was her favorite dish that night.

As highly priced and Westernized as it is incongruously authentic in ambience (lively, bustling, casual).

I felt that the food erred heavily on the sweet side of the palate and loathed to notice that there were few Asians, let alone Vietnamese people in the house...not that conspicuous attendance by a favorite trendy restaurant by Asian/Vietnamese people would NECESSARILY predict a five-star experience, either, in this town.

I don't consider three stars a bad review, by the way, and take solace in knowing that this place will continue raking it in one way or another, and honestly deserves to do so after having survived the sudden-death business zone of Brooklyn that is Park Slope.

But let's put it this way - I wasn't able to find any culinary escape from the awkward first date I was on, and have not been back since.

This place was phenomenal. They have a backyard patio that is absolutely beautiful with a ton of plants, great distancing and amazing ambience. You forget that you are dining during Covid times.  The service was top notch as well and our waiter was attentive and helpful. The Thai basil gimlet was high quality and refreshing. We ordered the summer rolls, papaya salad and pork belly taco. All were excellent. The summer roll and papaya salad were incredibly fresh and delicious but the winner was the pork belly taco and the sauce that came with it. Will be returning to explore the menu further.

I have been wanting to come here for a long time, and I tried several times on a weekend but without a reservation, it just isn't practical-at least an hour long wait.

I finally got in on a weeknight and really enjoyed the vibe. The service was lacking some, but nothing terrible. They were attentive in asking for food allergies and seemed willing to work with us.

There felt like a large proportion of seafood on the menu, which I only noticed because my friend doesn't eat seafood so options were limited.

We started off with the summer rolls, which were good, pretty standard-the peanut sauce was the star of the show, we had to ask for more.

I like that they have a seasonal menu.  For entrees we got 5-Spiced Duck Cassoulet which I felt was pretty underwhelming, not much flavor. The star of the show was the pork belly (isn't it always, though?!) in the Pork Belly Claypot. The pork was incredibly juicy and the flavor was en pointe.

I didn't have a cocktail but the options looked great-some kind of basil martini that I will have to try!

The hidden secret garden patio in the back is to die for!! And for people The people concerned with mosquitoes or fighting bugs for food, no worries. I think we saw one bee, but after a few attempts on his life ... he got the idea

In total there are only four real tables on the patio and then some kind of couch situation (one of the tables can seat up to 7/8 ppl). There's three makeshift cramped tables in the front in an attempt to bring in more business...pass-Wait for the garden.  We went on a Sunday for dinner and had to wait maybe 30 minutes for a table on the patio. No reservations accepted.

We had the crispy wings, the imperial rolls, garlic noodle bowls, and shrimp tacos. The wings were basic nothing good or bad-they came with an unexciting sauce on the side, the tacos are filling (I think there were two medium-sized shrimp in each taco),  the imperial rolls were delicious (suppper crispy.. thick crispy) and the garlic noodles have a hidden kick at the end of every bite, but definitely good. I think we expected a little bit more flavor in the dishes overall, but it was definitely good and we will return!

The customer service was par at best, but between covid and it basically feeling like the end of the world, I'll give them a pass. Stop by!!

The food was great, very tasty and unique. The COVID precautions seemed good at first: sanitizer given upon seating and a contactless menu. They have a lovely garden  that is nearly but not quite as packed as usual (they leave the middle seats open at the big middle table) as well as street-side seating in 5th Ave., which was closed. But then I saw that the guy doing the plating had his mask around his chin, leaving his nose and mouth exposed indoors. Moreover, the credit card transaction was pre-COVID style, even with a likely germ infected pen. The service was alright but somewhat distracted, even though no one was dining indoors.

Eat here if you are looking for tasty, guiltless food!  The interior is small and rather dark, so if the weather permits, definitely sit out back in their lush outdoor garden area.  It's peaceful and cozy.
The menu is simple and reasonably priced. I had the beef vermicelli.  It was very fresh and tasty.  The dressing was sweet with just a teeny bit of spice, so I added sriracha. The perfectly grilled beef was neatly placed on top of the noodles and fresh carrots, slices of zucchini and fresh herbs.  Would love to return to try more items from the menu!

Super upset at this restaurant! :( I was looking forward to vietnamese food but I was so disappointed. I ordered the summer rolls, which was good as it always should be. I was looking forward to the vermicelli dish that I seen on yelp but they didn't have it. So I ordered the shrimp claypot which was definitely not worth the price. It was about 5 pieces of shrimp and was full of all the other ingredients (onions and tomatoes). I ordered the chicken wings because I wasn't fully satisfied and as plain as they were, it was probably the best dish out of everything I tried. The only exceptional thing was that the bartender created a drink for me that was similar to the Rosemary's baby but instead of tequila, he put vodka and it was good! Definitely not worth what the total amount was...

Outstanding meal! The cocktails are creative and delicious. The small plates are varied and imaginative. The Nom Nom Beef was unique. The service is attentive. The room is comfortable. Usually I'm pleased I'm if there is onE cocktail or dish that makes me want to return. I have at least 5 reasons to want to return to Bricolage.

Pre covid my wife and I would come here regularly. Current covid we order delivery. The menu is a little different now, but still delicious. We are both vegan and this restaurant definitely has some amazing dishes and are willing to make adjustments to existing dishes to accommodate. Really really great. Looking forward to going back soon. Personally I like spicy and think the flavor of the food here is fantastic.

Absolutely gorgeous brunch. Sat outside in the roadway seating on a Saturday when the block was closed to traffic. Cool breeze on a sunny day, it was perfect. There is a back lush yard too but we fancied the street. The salmon eggs Benedict was perfectly cooked and the chicken and waffles. Fresh basil lemonade to wash it down was delicious. There were some yummy looking cocktails and drinks but we were working! Don't miss out it was a really great experience all around. Hand sanitizer available. Then wandered down the street to shop!

I had the unshaken beef Banh Mi and it was delicious! The texture of the beef was incredible. It broke down perfectly with the soft and crisp baguette (which was, as it should be, the star of the sandwich).

I ate at their sidewalk seating. The crew was very strict about their COVID procedures. They sanitized the table before my friend and I sat down. Masks always required. They had sanitizer at the register as well.

On Sept. 20 me and Jerry had dinner in the beautiful garden of bricolage. We had crispy imperial rolls, Vietnamese crepe, and bouillabaisse which were all incredibly delicious and the atmosphere was unique and magical! Unfortunately, I left my pocketbook in the restuarant that evening. The next morning they responded to my post on IG and asked if I left my pocketbook. I told them I was leaving that afternoon for a month and even though the restaurant is closed on Mondays they were kind enough to comedown to gave me my pocketbook  Thank you so much for your kindness and we'll see you soon!

This place was a DREAM! The outdoor back patio is gorgeous with lots of greenery and vintage touches everywhere. The also have seating set up on the street and sidewalk in front. Called at 2pm on a Saturday and we got their last reservation for the evening! Definitely plan ahead and make a reso if you have a party of 4 or more!
The drinks were phenomenal, I got the Vietnamese Gin & Tonic; my friend got their seasonal drink: The Transistor, and my other friend got GGs Brother. We all loved our drinks and ordered another round.
We started with the Crispy Imperial Rolls and they were awesome and just the perfect size to split with 4 people.
For entree we got 2 chicken B√°hn M√¨, a pork B√°hn M√¨, and the spicy garlic noodles.
Everything was delicious! Can't wait to eat here again!

This place is a gem. The food is amazing! Try the shrimp clay pot and the appetizer fried rolls. The service and staff are great. You really get a sense that they are invested in the community. Also the garden out back is so beautiful and unique. We 100% recommend!

Pros: cool vibe, good service, good cocktails
Cons: the bahn xeo was burnt, freshness of Vietnamese food felt overpowered by fried flavor, felt a little overpriced for quality

Would go back to try different food and give another shot

Came here on whim after a workout class with my friends - we arrive at around 1:15PM and there was no wait for 3 people so we sat down.

The place is pretty spacious, but the tables that share the wooden bench can get very cramped, j struggled getting into my seat without feeling like I was accidentally shoving the girl sitting at the next table.

I ordered the spicy lemongrass shrimp vermeicelli, one fried ordered the spicy beef noodle soup and the other ordered the papaya salad with spicy shrimp and we got French fries to share as a side. One big complaint: it took almost 25 minutes before our food was served. My vermeicelli was fine, nothing crazy mind blowing, definitely need to drizzle the fish sauce in. My friend's spicy beef noodle soup had some very fatty pieces of skin which she did not enjoy, and it was pretty spicy. The other friend's papaya salad was acceptable. I think we weren't crazy impressed by the food because we ended up waiting so long. The fries to share were good when warm, but when it cooled down, I tasted like frozen French fries that were reheated up.

Lastly, it took time for them to get us our bill, but also, getting our cards for them to process took even longer. I was genuinely confuser because by the time we paid, the restaurant emptied out.....why the slow service?

Overall, I wouldn't say the food was terrible but the service could really improve. I would not recommend coming here for a "quick" bite.

Went with a group of eight tonight. When I called the day before to see if they could accommodate our party, they could not have been nicer, and asked if we could come in at 5:45PM instead of 6:00 so they could shuffle some tables.

Service from start to finish was excellent and attentive. And the food is always so, so good.  We ordered the crispy sweetbreads, deviled eggs, Summer rolls, vegetarian Summer Rolls, Shishto peppers, Vietnamese crepe and Imperial rolls as starters. I know. But everyone wanted to try everything.  Highly recommend the sweetbreads.  I wasn't crazy about the pork belly in the summer rolls but the peanut sauce was great. I wish I had let the Imperial rolls cool down a bit, but I would happily return just to order them again. They're like crispy egg rolls with a very hot and tangy sauce served with butter lettuce and mint.

For entrees we ordered clay pot shrimp (super spicy but tangy and delicious),  5 Spiced Duck Cassoulet (another dish to return for), Branzino, Lemongrass tofu, Shaking beef and banh canh noodle.

Go with a group. Everything on the menu was really flavorful and well spiced. Not a single complaint from this crew.  I didn't have room for dessert but the bread pudding and the molten chocolate cake with gorgonzola were big hits.

The bill with drinks was $80 a head, which was totally worth it. Our waiter was really top notch.  Even without a reservation, Bricolage would be worth the wait. Can't wait to go back!

Love this place. We have been half a dozen times in the last year. Food is hands down amazing and deserves 5 stars. Summer rolls are very fresh, the Imperial roll (basically a fried summer roll presented with lettuce and mint to wrap around the roll) is a guilty pleasure. The crepe is outrageously good - a crispy fried crepe stuffed with fat noodles and shrimp with a nice dipping sauce. Papaya salad is a nice, healthy antidote to the crepe.

We ordered the ribeye steak (Unshaking beef - get it, you're welcome) , the pork belly and a noodle dish last night, each of which I would have happily ordered again, and possible should have.

Desserts were nothing to write home about. A maple walnut pecan pie (but they only had 2 slices left so I didn't get much of a taste) and an awful tapioca pudding with grass jelly - seriously do not order it. It's dessert sadness.

Service has always been a little spotty. Friendly but not all there. And for that I take off a star. I also find it a bit grubby.  I used to go here when it was Brooklyn Fish Camp and I feel it hasn't really been scoured since that time.  The outdoor patio area reminds me of my hippy friends who have cats roaming all over their apartment, and are really into Buddha statues and candles. It needs a little spiffing up but you can overlook the d√©cor because the food is really pretty great.

Overall a really good dining experience in a bistropub with a really good vibe. Pros: the large dishes are great to share, super flavorful and cooked super well. Loved the side dishes and comp'd rice too. Con: some of the apps missed the spot (the chips for example, not a lot of flavor and tiny portions), and some of the cocktails were too strong on the alcohol/not super balanced. Staff is very friendly, however we were seated literally a couple inches away from the couple next to us, it feels cramped.
The outside garden/patio looked beautiful and we'll try that next time.

We had a really pleasant lunch here.  I got the Vermicelli w/ Beef, and it was a nice cut of beef that was cooked perfectly to medium rare.  The veg and fish sauce with the Vermicelli were quite nice, lots of rich flavors.
My wife got the Pho Ga and also thought it was good.  Lastly we shared a vegetarian summer roll, which came with a delicious peanut sauce.

Service was reasonable, the food didn't come out super quick, but not annoyingly slow either.  From what I could see there were only 2 people working (1 cook and 1 server), so the speed at which they operated was actually pretty impressive.

Bricolage is a charming restaurant with a modern take on Vietnamese cuisine. The restaurant has outdoor spaces (a patio and a terrace) and is open at the time I am writing. The patio, created by an artist, is particularly unique and charming. Dining there feels like peaceful retreat away from the city. We organised a small event in the patio and the restaurant management was very friendly and professional. Our guests had a great time and we received a lot of compliments on the food and beautiful atmosphere of the evening. Thanks to all the Bricolage staff!

Overpriced, one flavor, spicy. Hiding the flavor of all the food under a ton of spices does NOT make it good, it just burns your mouth.

I get it, attendance is down in restaurants. That doesn't mean that anyone that DOES come to your restaurant needs to make up for all the money you'd normally make.

Dinner for two WITHOUT alcohol should NOT cost $65. A banh mi should not be what they charge for it. It's ridiculously overpriced and has exactly one flavor, spicy.

Save your money for better food at a decent price.
