We have eaten at Al Mar in person for a nice family dinner (went early and its kid friendly) but recently we ordered takeout due to COVID.  Really impressed with the baby pork ribs with mashed potatoes, it was a complete meal at a reasonable price, and the ribs were fall off the bone amazing! Mashed potatoes were really good too.  Wife got the eggplant parm, which she thought was good but could have used a little more crispy crust.  Will definitely be going back, this is one of the few places were we felt the takeout was almost as good as eating at the actual restaurant!

Look no further for an amazing pasta dish, cocktail, or oversized soup when you're visiting the Dumbo area. Just around the corner from the "it" spot for that photo you want to take under the bridge, and there's outdoors seating right now during the fall (great perk for a beautiful autumn day). I had the butternut squash soup, which could be a meal on its own bc it's a big bowl! Nutmeg and cloves highlight the dish and make it a seasonal delight. The whipped ricotta was good, with honey drizzled over it and a walnut topping it, but it wasn't anything to write home about.
The pasta dishes were amazing! I had the pumpkin caramelle which were cute ribbon raviolis in a gentle butter and sage sauce. light and delightful! my friend has the penne in a pink sauce with sausage crumbles and that one was fantastic! highly recommend; doesn't seem like you could go wrong here.

Lovely ambience with a rustic vibe right in the heart of Dumbo. The food was just mediocre. Instagram worthy, but lacking some dimension.

The egg in a cloud was cool to look at, but you realize that eating a large volume of fluffy egg whites doesn't do much for you. I appreciate the cheese and spinach beneath, but felt this dish could use another component.

The eggs purgatory had a pretty plain tomato base, the bread was good, but the kale on the side seemed like an afterthought.

For about $14 per dish, I was not full whatsoever and nothing seemed to stand out. It was just ok.

We ordered the Nutella Panino and this was also disappointing. Everything seemed too soft and I felt the bread could have been toasted to create contrast between the already soft Nutella.

Again, maybe this is too critical but for New York City, I think you can get better tasting breakfast at this price point!

PSA: Pay with CASH. If you pay with card they charge you an extra 4% fee.

TL;DR: Affordable brunch place in dumbo. Super cute aesthetic. Seems they're most known for is their Egg Cloud dish. Brunch prices for entrees were between $12 and $15 which isn't bad.

Took some out of town friends here because we were looking to eat brunch not too far from the Brooklyn bridge. It's a super cute Italian place about a 5 min walk from the bridge walking entrance and you can get a pretty clear picture of the Manhattan bridge from the street perpendicular to the restaurant.

We got here at 11 am on a Sunday and were able to be seated without reservations. The hostess did look pretty concerned when we said we didn't have a reservation so I'd recommend making one unless you'll coming as soon as the restaurant opens. There's a good amount of seating inside and some at the bar. It was pretty busy already and our food took some time to come out. The whole restaurant was decorated for Halloween which I thought was pretty cute! Prices weren't that bad either for brunch, most brunch items were between $12 and $15 for entrees.

For apps, we got the tomato bruschetta which I thought was okay. Didn't blow my mind but was still very tasty and everything was fresh.

For meals, all 3 of us were super basic and got the egg in the cloud. It's fluffed egg whites topped with the egg yolk sitting on top. The egg sits on top of super crispy brioche with ham and cheese and the whole thing is surrounded by cooked spinach. I was worried the egg whites would taste weird but it was very airy and light.

I'd definitely come back if I'm in the Dumbo area!

Good brunch place. A quick walk from the Cliffs at Dumbo if you're looking for a good place to eat after bouldering. At around Sunday 1:40pm, we arrived and there was a 20 min wait to get seated.

I got the smoked salmon panini which taste very good and was healthy.

The atmosphere is chill with plenty of seats. Even when it was fully seated, conversation was easily made and heard.

Note that there is a 4percent upcharge from the prices that you see on the menu if you pay with credit card!

I'm giving 5 star for my breakfast experience. Food was sooo delicious. All the flavors mixed are just perfect. If you're around the area,
Service was fast and waiter very nice.
If you're around for breakfast, this is the place to go to.
However, during lunch their menu is not so great. It is a complete different experience.

The hanger steak is some of the best steak I've ever had. Is it a little pricey, yes. $38 for hanger steak and salad is probably $6-8 too much but boy it's damn good. The rest of the food/place is really nice. Wet right under Manhattan bridge you get a true NY experience in a date night style restaurant. Food has been really good every time we've been, nothing has really disappointed. I would highly recommend if on a date or just wanting a great meal. I never hear this place mentioned amongst the best restaurants but it's a low key gem.

Great brunch in Brooklyn near the waterfront.  The wife and I spent a day in Brooklyn and it started at AlMar.  My wife had the frittantina.  It was like an omelet that hadn't been flipped.  It was very tasty, and made me immediately think I have to up my asparagus game at home.  I had the AlMar sandwich with egg, bacon, avocado, etc.  It was really tasty too.  I enjoyed it being served with a salad.

At some point during my wife's comparison shopping between the fifth and sixth iteration of leather chairs, it struck me: I was famished and I wasn't going to make it much longer.

Not wanting to die on the showroom floor, I lifted myself off of the saddle leather Mid-Century Show Wood chair (pass -- not much back support above the shoulder blades) ... and dragged myself into AlMar which sat a block away.

The ambiance was rustic and natural and the brunch menu looked just as inviting. I came, I caffeinated, I conquered.

I really enjoyed the food I ordered: Cheese bread topped with two eggs, truffle oil and a side of asparagus. I also ordered a side of potatoes, and since we had eleven more chairs to compare, I treated myself to the Nutella panini.

An egg in the cloud is a must-try in Dumbo. It's definitely unique and can't get this anywhere else. Egg white is made into a foam like merengue and half done york is dropped right in the middle. The cloud itself didn't have much taste but I liked how the whole dish wasn't salty at all. And the toast! It was crunchy outside, soft inside and went really well with the cloud on top. And they give so much spinach with it and they are perfect. We did order egg toast too and it was almost the same as the egg on the cloud as the toast was exactly the same and the only difference between the two was the cloud, ham and the truffle oil. I think next time I come, I'll order pasta as it is an italian restaurant.

The restaurant is beautifully decorated with open windows, big screen projector playing on the side with a bar on the other side. They have a lot of plants in the restaurant which brings lovely vibe to it. Also, the receiptionist and the wait staff are really friendly and really welcome the patrons.

Brunching at AlMar is one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had in New York. And one of the first things to note about this place is that they charge an additional 4% on any bills paid with a credit card (instead of cash) plus an "encouraged-by-the-owner" 20% tip is automatically tacked onto your bill regardless of your party size. The 4% is mentioned on all their menus and the 20% is not, unless you catch and ask about it at the end of your meal.

For 4 people, we had a reservation for a Saturday at 11:30a. The place was fairly empty when we got there but it did gradually fill up by the time we left. We ordered 2x The Almar, Eggs Purgatory, Grilled Portobello Mushroom Panini, 1x side of Roasted Potatoes, 1x side of Organic, Thick-Cut Bacon, 1x Spritz, 2x Mimosa, 2x The Great Saint, and 2x The Dumbo. The food tasted fine and everything was going well until we asked for the bill and saw that they've:
1. charged another table's entire tab onto ours,
2. charged us for a drink they said they'd remove because they missed it the first time around, and
2. added a 20% gratuity.

When we brought these issues up, our server apologized for the incorrect bill and explained that the 20% gratuity is encouraged by the owner. He also said he'd remove the additional drink along with all of the items from a different table. However, when he returned, he said, "I removed all of the incorrectly added items and the 20% gratuity but I'm not going to remove the drink anymore." We reminded him that he said he'd remove the drink but he slams his fist on our table and says, "I'm not going to argue about this with you. This is the final bill." At this point, we're shocked and just staring at him as he walked away.

A few days later, I wrote in directly to the restaurant about this unprofessional behavior and inexcusable experience. The owner apologized and invited us back for a second visit; we've responded asking when he'd like us to return but he hasn't replied and it's been over two weeks. Given how our brunch turned out and how the owner handled the follow up, I don't believe a good dining experience is a priority for AlMar and I don't think I'll ever return again.

An OK place. Stopped by for brunch, lured in by good Yelp rank, but experienced a rather sub-par meal.
If you rarely have cash on you, be prepared to pay 4% extra for using your credit card here! I was really appalled to see that info on the menu and I find it really disgraceful in today's bitcoin dnage...
Our server was very quiet and though not entirely lethargic, it took forever to order, get a beer and especially get the check (which would have never come if it wasn't for the other server who was much more efficient). This poor service had a lot to do with the poor impression of the place.
The place itself is old and in a desperate need of fresh coat of paint on the dirty walls and ceiling. There is only one co-ed restroom.
The food is OK. My husband had a carbonara, which was good but the portion was small.
I had the sandwich with scrambled eggs, bacon, cheese and veggies on a brioche bun. They ran out of avocado, so offered to sub with spinach. When the sandwich came with no spinach, I asked and they brought it as a side 10 min later, when I was half through my meal.
After all these hiccups, there is no need for me to go back.

Bland food and mediocre service. Not a place I would bring visiting friends. The restaurant is large and food is reasonably priced but I was extremely disappointed by the quality.

Came for Sunday brunch and was told they couldn't seat three of us at a four person table for fear of "messing up the flow" even though there were many tables available.

Egg in a Cloud: We came to try (and take photos of) this. I was impressed by how fluffy they made the egg white. It really looked like a cloud. It didn't have much taste but the bread, ham and cheese below were good. The spinach on the side was also super bland and watery.

Burrata Salad: Lots of olives, super bland, salad had no flavor but burrata was okay.

Crispy Risotto Cake: The risotto was super tasteless and extremely under salted. The presentation was unimpressive - a risotto pancake blanketed by two sunny side up eggs. We couldn't taste the butternut squash at all.

Bellini: The bellini was decent for $8, a little strong but manageable.

All the dishes had very basic taste profiles so they shouldn't haven't have been hard to get right but every single one was disappointingly bland in its own way.

Besides the food, the waitress also didn't tell us that there was a 4% processing fee for credit cards. We didn't find out until they'd already processed our cards.

AlMar wasn't a place that put me on my ass and think "wow how did I live without this place?", but it also wasn't a place that I'll forget about...that makes 4 stars appropriate, right?

I came for a late Sunday brunch with my fiancé after a long night out and they had all of the comfort-style/heavy/greasy-yet-not-type food we could have wanted...very specific, but anyone with a hangover knows what I'm talking about.  We started with the ricotta bruschetta, 2 pieces of toast total and it was a great palette-opener - def recommend trying!

Then we got the BLT (added on avo) and the Old Fashioned Breakfast.  The BLT was good, but def too much either mushy avo or aioli, it was hard to tell what there was too much of.  The Old Fashion got the thumbs up from my fiance - the bacon was awesome.

In addition to the other reviews, definitely take cash out before going...their credit card fee is only 4%, but still, you have your bill, taxes, and tip, so adding on yet another charge can be an issue...our bill for everything (including 2 craft beers) came to $65 and with tip, $80...fortunately I took out exactly $80!!

I def want to come back for the dinner here...their pastas look amazing, the prices are so reasonable and it's so convenient for anyone within 1 subway stop of DUMBO...def recommend!

Tourist trap! On the website it says that they are cash only. When we called them they said they are taking credit cards. When we received the bill it says it is 4% extra charge if we pay with card, but no one told us that when we called them. food is okay, the quality is also not great. something that you can make yourself - sandwiches, eggs. I would suggest to avoid this place.

Made my first trip to Al Mar for dinner just a few weeks ago and was very pleased with the quality of the meal. Very friendly and helpful servers, beautiful ambience, long wooden tables, packed restaurant with a quiet buzz. Bread served prior to meals. House red was spot on. we went as a big group so we sampled pastas, fish dishes, pork chop, salads, etc. Every meal was a homerun, every plate was inhaled. we enjoyed the meal so much that we came back a week later and had the same experience! prices are very fair for such a quality meal. highly recommend to others!

Loved Brunch at AlMar! I was on a trip for pet work, part pleasure and visited AlMar for a brunch meeting. The Egg Toast was delicious as well as the Americano. I liked it so much that I brought my family back the next morning. My kiddo had the pancakes which she loved. My spouse got a smoked salmon panini which they said was delicious and a Bloody Mary.

The eggs on a cloud was the best dish here and the $8 dollar bellinis/bloody marys/mimosas were a steal (especially for the pricey Dumbo area). Also there was no waiting time when I went (Saturday at 12) which was a plus.

Lighting was a bit too dim for brunch so I took off a star.

Great little joint in Dumbo Brooklyn. My husband and I spent the day at the 911 memorial. I had never walked across the Brooklyn Bridge and it was something I wanted to experience. I yelped restaurants to eat at once we got across the bridge. We decided on Almar and it was the perfect choice. We decided to share some plates since we had never been here. We both ordered a glass of red wine. The rustic bread and evoo brought to the table was very good. We ordered the tomato bruschette, mixed green salad, and lasagne bolognese. Everything tasted wonderful. We finished with a glass  off grappa and pistachio  chocolate tartufo. Yummy! I will definitely return to try other menu items. Service was excellent and hip/casual atmosphere was fun.

I love this spot, I've tried it a few times. I can understand why people say the hit or miss thing but its probably just due to personal tastes. I went here a few weeks ago and I've never had something bad until I tried lasagne, the cheese they use wasn't very good to me. Very salty, needed more tomato sauce, too much cheese (not a cheese i recognized). The sauce, meat, pasta was good but the cheese was not what I as an Italian was used to. I've had other entrees of chicken and the pastas that were always great but this time I wasn't enamored with the entree. That being said it is still  a worthwhile spot but just ask questions before you order. One thing I always get that is absolutely my favorite is the tomato bruschette aperitivo.

Wow, so happy we tried this spot for brunch today. I remember when it first opened years ago in Dumbo, when I lived down the block. I've never been for brunch, and finally did today.

Get the egg in a cloud and the crispy egg risotto with squash and Parmesan. Also, get the latte, which comes in this day-fueling mega mug.

This spot is refreshing non-pretentious and surprisingly affordable in an area that's changed a ton, for better or worse.

I'll be back, AlMar!

5 Stars!!!!!!

Although I didn't get the opportunity to eat here, I am an executive assistant who arranged a dinner at this location - this past Thursday evening.  Not only was it simple and easy to make the reservation, give the credit card information over the phone, and ask other questions - but the feedback I received back from the meal that everyone had, was out of this world.  It was a group of 12 people from all over the world (Italy, London, Germany, US, ex.) so I was even more thrilled that this restaurant gave the impression that it did!  Additional thanks to Marcello is helping me arrange everything - looking forward to do business with you in the future.

Alright, so I'm not from the city, that's probably half my problem. But the Goat Cheese & Arugula salad I paid $12.50 for would have been three times bigger even an hour north. I was hungry, I'd been hauling ass through the subways all morning, I just wanted to put some food into my maw. But after clearing my plate (even slowly, as I was in mid-conversation the whole while) I was sad that I was still so freaking hungry. Maybe in the city I should have been prepared to blow $40, even $50 on a lunch that would fill me up. I guess I learned something new in Brooklyn that day. Unfortunately, it was "Don't eat in Brooklyn unless you make six figures."

Even the salad looked disappointed. Like it was sorry I had to eat it.

Luckily the establishment is lovely and clean, the staff is lovely and clean, and after eating that salad and drinking some water, I too felt lovely and clean.

But. Still hungry.

For residents of DUMBO, AlMar is an institution. A joint. A place where one can escape the throngs of selfie-obsessed tourists down the block and enjoy an inventive, well-crafted meal at surprisingly affordable prices in a casually chic environment. A place welcoming enough to bring your screaming toddler, yet cool enough to bring a date and order off the menu.

Dear Basic Bettys and Chads of Yelp who complain about the 4% credit card surcharge: I welcome you to the economic reality of small business in 2019. Did you rent go up? AlMar's probably did, too (except unlike you, daddy doesn't pay their rent). Most restaurants simply build this credit card surcharge into the pricing rather than give you the choice to bring cash, and if the extra $1 on your perfectly cooked ribeye is a deal-breaker, you need to go back to the McRib (no shame in that, by the way!). On behalf of DUMBO, I can assure you that we won't miss your minty vape smell, VICE-driven political hot takes about countries you couldn't pick out on a map, and the loud chatter (while I'm trying to eat) about your Rumble Boxing class or why he won't call you back. (I just met you 3 minutes ago and I'm sitting 5 tables over -- I can tell you why he ghosted).

This is New York. Appreciate a restaurant like AlMar. It's why you live here.

Egg in a Cloud put me on cloud nine! If you see a photo of this beautiful brunch creation and are not exactly sure what it is, here's the description straight off the menu: "Baked Egg Yolks in Whipped Egg Whites on top of Toasted Brioche with Smoked Ham & Fontina Cheese, Served with Sauteed Spinach". If that doesn't sound delicious to you, we need to talk. The egg whites are so fluffy and all the textures complement each other nicely. The price is a reasonable $14 for a very filling brunch, which is basically two meals already!

I called for a reservation for Saturday 11:30 brunch, but the restaurant was not that busy before noon. So when we arrived, there were still several unoccupied tables. This was not the case by the time we finished our meal - there seemed to be a long wait. I would still recommend just making a reservation. Location is super convenient if you're exploring the Brooklyn Bridge and Dumbo.

My reasons for four stars instead of five: an annoying fly buzzing around us during our meal (restaurant is open air) and the somewhat pricey avocado side ($4).

They are not cash only anymore and do take credit card!

We arrived in Brooklyn on a Friday afternoon after visiting Ellis Island and, based on Yelp reviews, we decided to eat here for a late lunch.

The restaurant is not large, and had been crowded at lunch time because we got there late and most tables were still taken.  It's a fairly noisy room given the high ceiling and lack of anything that resists noise.

We had the caprese panino, the farm salad and the chicken marsala.  The panini lacked much flavor - it needed fresh basil (a tiny piece there), which the restaurant could have grown by the barrel given their huge sunny windows in front.  The rest was good, not great. My glass of wine (Donnaluna) was expensive.

Overall, an ok stop but nothing really special.

I hosted a private dinner at Al Mar and was delighted every step of the way. We were able to get a full buyout of the space for 35 people and it was the perfect size to host both a cocktail reception and dinner. The venue is quaint, charming and rustic that made the space feel very cozy.

The manager was flexible with our needs and was very accommodating from start to end. The food and wine was of the highest quality and the servers were very on top of everything. I would definitely go back again to dine there on a regular night or host another event.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!

Had an early dinner last Tuesday. What a cute joint. We had a cocktail each, both super yummy and well made. Then the bruschetta with ricotta, honey and truffle parmesan. Not your traditional bruschetta but very delicious. I liked that it was on a country style soft crusty bread. Then I had the risotto cake and my fiance the barley salad. The risotto cake was so inventive and delicious. I will definitely try to make this at home. The barley salad was delicious too, I do wish it was warm, but very nice. I found them both a little under seasoned, but still delicious. Then we had dessert, lemon sorbet and the hazel chocolate torte. They were a great combination. The torte so rich and the sorbet tart and refreshing. We will definitely go again.

I arrived at 1PM and had a short wait. I put down my phone number and walked around the block. The receptionist called me just when I walked up to their entrance again. I really liked the phone call system as some places require you to stick around in the blazing sun until they're ready.

Admittedly, I came here for their egg in a cloud because it was enticing and a beauty. However, I ended up getting their smoked salmon panini while my boyfriend ordered their egg in a cloud. We also shared roasted potatoes ($5), which was pretty hard and pricy for simply potatoes!

I was not surprised to find that I liked my smoked salmon panini much better than the egg in a cloud, even though it's more of a sandwich than panini. I wasn't fond of the bread, but overall my "panini" was filling and delicious, while the egg in a cloud is a novel idea but not excellent. I'd say the taste is a more airy version of an egg, ham, and cheese croissant.

Great food & service. Stopped by for lunch and luckily we were seated right away (tends to get very packed quickly aka 40 minute wait). Got a cute table under the window. I opted for their lunch special which consisted of half grilled chicken panini & a wild shrimp salad. Amazing quality, freshness & presentation.
Also had their rum runner after. Definitely recommend.

A wonderful Italian style Brunch at Brooklyn! The environment is peace and quiet, and our table next to the window is such a good spot!
Food looks so good and is worth for photo-shooting! Egg in the cloud is rly creative (tho it doesn't taste as good as it looks I still recommend to try it haha)

Came here for a quick lunch spot since we were around the area. Cute little spot! Loved their food and vibe there. Their service was good as well. Brought my best friend there to grab lunch before she was proposed to.  There was a little corner spot there that looked like a dining table of someone's house and gave off the 80s vibe for some reason. Should try! Look at what we ordered

Brunch review:

$$ for your brunch options. Beware, your panini will not show up toasted?! Coffee is good, mimosas are better. The Sunday morning we came, they were out of portobello mushrooms, prosciutto and goat cheese. In addition to our options being limited because of this, our waitress was very new and did not seem to know the menu well yet, which made explaining what items were available a bit more tasking. Decor is casual chic and oh so cute. Bathrooms are clean and the food comes fairly fast. Also within short walking distance (2 blocks) to the carousel and Brooklyn Bridge footpath.

I almost wonder if I ate somewhere different than all these other reviewers. I liked the size of the menu and the restaurant is a nice location and size. Unfortunately that is where the likes ended, the host was kind, the server although a busy Saturday was distracted and didn't come to check on us at all. Grossly underseasoned, underwhelming and overpriced. I picked around the sandwich, left the salad untouched and yet that raised no concerns when the plate was collected.

I came here for convenience of being in DUMBO to satisfy some friends who were visiting (and had to walk the bridge). I did not come here for such a delightful brunch time.

This place is spectacular because of its:
- sweet staff
- glorious Bloody Mary, extra spicy
- Egg Toast, which is not as well known as the Egg on a Cloud but it is equally heavenly with the truffle oil and golden egg yolks and fontina cheese. Amaze.
- movie that plays on the wall to help you forget the previous week's stress along with rainymood worthy back ground noise that's the perfect amount of dish clinking and laughter

Such a sweet place for brunch on a sunny day with clear sky and possible non-voluntary walk on Brooklyn Bridge. Make sure to stay to your left and not get hit by the bicyclists.

*shout out to the Egg Toast again because I recommend 10/10.

I went here with friends for lunch over the weekend, and the interior decor of the restaurant was cosy and well-thought out. The food is okay... nothing special and not bad. It just didn't stand out to us.

However, beware. This establishment charges an extra 4% for you to use credit card to pay your bill. I don't think that this is right. 4%! I mean c'mon. I most likely will not be coming back because of this new extra surcharge.
