Haven't frequented this bar in a while. Forgot how good the drinks were here. They had a nice layout outside. Shout out to our waiter last night (Jelani) for dealing with our large group. He pointed us to all the good stuff and kept us aware of the time.

We came in 5mn before the kitchen closes and managed to order their crispy Brussel Sprouts (Amazing!)
For drinks, I started out with their namesake the Clover Club. All ingredients that I love : Gin, dry vermouth, raspberry, lemon and egg white. I could sip on that every night. My friend enjoyed the Mediterranean Mule (Grey goose vodka, Montenegro, strawberry, ginger, lemon, soda). Lovely tall drink!
I moved on to the Clever Girl (Old Tom Gin, lemon, raspberry, blackberry, vanilla, prosecco). I found it to be a refreshing and festive cocktail.
For the rest of our group, the bartender improvised and made a Kentucky Derby with whiskey, raspberry, lemon & soda. It came out strong and super well balanced.

Really love the fact that you can taste the quality in every sip of their drinks, plus the food is awesome!

Came for brunch at around 1 pm on a Sunday and there was no wait for a table for two outdoors. My boyfriend and I shared the duck hashbrown and fried chicken waffle. I also had a frozen pina colada, which was perfect. Out of the dishes, the waffle was my favorite. Homemade chips were amazing.

Next time: I want to try the deviled eggs and more cocktails!

This review is so simple to write. Nothing complicated. I just think $15 for a drink with less than a shot of alcohol is absurd.

I was so excited to try this place. Yesterday I ordered one of their hot drinks. I'm 5'2, a lightweight, and can easily get tipsy from a glass of wine. I did not feel the alcohol in the drink one bit- just sugar water. Will not be going back as there are too many great bars in the area.  Not that I order drinks to get buzzed, I could have just gotten a tea for $3 somewhere else had I known. (insert emoji shrugging shoulders here).

Got delivery from here tonight. Looks like they still have some kinks to work out on the delivery menu/offerings, but it was ...okay. Portions were small- I normally have a very small appetite, but had no problem polishing off their steak frites ($25) and crisps ($8) by myself. Crisps were amazing, the standout of the night. Fries were good and homemade- albeit all fries suffer from delivery. (Photos of both chips and fries taken before any were eaten.) Steak was a great cut, but absolutely abolished by the amount of black pepper on it. Like it made my nose run. I didn't envy my mom and friend's eating situations with their burgers- these were multiple napkin affairs, and my friend gave up after her bun dissolved. Was hoping this would be a place I'd want to head to in person after this mess, but it looks like it's one I may be crossing off the list instead. $100+ tab for 3 with no drinks/desserts, I think my expectations were a bit higher.

From what I've read, Clover Club is considered by many to be one of the best cocktail bars in Brooklyn. This past weekend, I also learned it's a fine spot for brunch. And I'm not just saying that because they serve duck hash... okay, maybe I am. That cozy atmosphere extends to brunch as well, as does their list of interesting brunch cocktails, combined with some boozy coffees which made a first drink choice more difficult than I expected. I eventually went with something called an Afternoon Buzz, which was probably a foreshadowing of the rest of my day and evening.

The food came out really quickly. The duck hash was not chunks of meat and potato as I might have expected, but more like a giant patty almost the size of the plate, topped with a fried egg and two spicy sauces (I think a sriracha and an aioli) with the colors looking deceptively like they had added strips of bacon on top (such a tease). But a thumbs up on the pancakes, some of the best ones I've had at a restaurant in a long time.

While I agree that some spiciness is goodness, that doesn't mean extra spiciness is better. I could have done with a bit less of the sauces to let the flavor of the hash speak for itself (meaning I had to scrape a bit off). My dining companion, who does enjoy her Bloody Mary a bit peppery, also commented that she felt her drink was too peppery.

It was great to dine here, and now I'm looking forward to a return visit some evening for more.

My partner and I stopped by here the other night because it was cold out and they have hot cocktails on the menu. By the end, we had tried every hot cocktail there was, and they were all delicious. I can't remember their names, but the one with Mezcal was my favorite. We also ordered a steak appetizer and crab dip - so so good! We're looking forward to coming back and having a proper dinner.

Beautiful atmosphere, highly recommend for date night/first date. It a big bar yet intimate and quaint with candles on all the tables. They have a very reasonable happy hour that I took full advantage of. This place is elevated bar food, I loved the chips with tangy creme dip.

I would discrediting humanity if I don't address their breading pudding. It is ridiculously good. It has a subtle sweetness. Honestly could eat this everyday for a year and be happy. Make room for it!

Ooh, I have been here twice in the last few months and have enjoyed myself each time!

Loves:
+ The drinks. Everything is good. Their booklet is also the cutest drink booklet ever as there are caricatures of the staff inside!
+ Food is good. Some of my faves include: mac & cheese ($15), fried chicken ($20), spinach & artichoke dip ($11), and crispy brussel sprouts ($13).
+ Their sister restaurant is Leyenda but let me tell you, it feels like 10x easier to hear people in this place.

Not so love:
- The seats near the door, lol. I wore my winter coat throughout dinner because I was still that cold.

Even though this awesome place is in my hood I cannot visit her all the time because I don't always feel like paying $50 for dinner, but when I do feel like having a #treatyoself moment, I know Clover Club is here to help this girl out! :)

Fancy drinks with specialty cocktails
Ordered the coconutree holy grail
This place has a Really nice vibe
Ordered some food to try
The grilled octopus was not that great
too much beans and not enough octopus to ate
Those hot chicken sliders were spicy
Felt like it's missing some fries since it's pricey
Overall this place is classy
So dress nice and be glassy

I did an event at Books Are Magic last month and more than one person suggested getting drinks at Clover Club before heading over to the bookstore. I go to a lot of readings and really appreciate a good bar within a short walk of a bookstore. These bars are not only great default hangouts for reading-adjacent events, but they tend to be in fun, walkable areas, and appeal to the exact yipster nerds who voluntarily spend their evenings listening to authors talk about books.

We met up at Clover Club at around 5:30 on a rainy Thursday and were able to get a table for five with ease. The place never felt empty, but it stayed pretty calm the whole time we were there. I liked the dim, speakeasyish ambiance and decor--a set-up I've definitely seen before, but one that I tend to enjoy. Service was decent, though I might have ordered a second drink if our waiter had checked on us a little more often.

I'm pregnant, so I wasn't really drinking in any case. The cocktails all looked delicious and I watched with envy as my friends drank them. I was happy to find a selection of zero-proof cocktails, at least, and ordered the Before Sunset, a refreshing, sweet and spicy drink with ginger, pineapple, lemon, lime, and jalapeño.

Clover Club also has food, so we shared a few snacks, and I got some sliders for an easy dinner. We got the salty and sweet spiced nuts, the deviled eggs, and the spinach artichoke dip for the table. I liked the deviled eggs--there was an assortment of them with different things on top, and I'm not sure which ones I ate, but they were tasty. The spinach artichoke dip was great, served with house tortilla chips. I didn't try the nuts, but I assume they were fine. The hot chicken sliders were solid, with buttermilk and cayenne-marinated chicken finished with herb aioli and house hot sauce.

I had a swell time at Clover Club and will probably come back any time I visit Books Are Magic. It's a comfortable bar with nice atmosphere and lots to drink and snack on. Hopefully next time, I'll be able to drink the actual cocktails.

Stands the test of time! I'm cringing a little at the review I wrote in my 20s (I was a food critic, apparently), but I'm glad to say that I've never stopped coming to this amazing place!

In all the years I've visited, I'm quite sure I've never had a bad drink. My companion, a cocktail fanatic, is totally gaga for this place, it's like a kid in candy store. Always a treat.

They got a new food menu somewhat recently and it's excellent! Just the perfect place to go, all around. The staff are so professional, the ambience is so cozy, especially in the winter. What's not to love??

Never change, Clover Club!!

We stopped by this gem on a rainy Saturday afternoon for some upscale daydrinking. The back room with the fireplace was perfecly cozy and warm. I had a few Colletti royales and my bestie stuck to NY sours. Both were delicious, even to sweet drink haters like us.

We ordered the lamb burger with crisps and a side of potato cakes. The burger was delicious, though kind of unoriginal (flavored with cumin, topped with goat cheese.) Sometimes it's better not to mess with what works, though. The potato cakes were absolutely blah. They were served cold and they were super dense and not too flavorful. The creme fraiche they came with was great, but it didn't quite go. It was much better with the crisps that came with the burger.

For the price of drinks at this place (and the amount we tend to consume) I think we will definitely go for the punch bowl next time. It claims to serve 4-6, but I think that's just their opinion...

I came here on Sunday night for dinner and it wasn't busy. The place was very dark and we sat by the window. It's good for dates or large groups. We ordered several cocktails and plates to share. Prices were average. Service needs improvement.

Oysters - Overpriced, tiny and very briny. I wouldn't recommend.

Spicy PEI Mussels - Delicious. It's not actually spicy in my opinion. The wine broth was so buttery and great for dipping. Don't be afraid to ask for more bread!

Crisps with duck fat and truffle creme -Soooo addictive but extremely heavy and greasy. The flavors of duck and fat and truffle were strong and worked very well together.

Cocktails - Very good and nicely crafted. My favorite of course was the Clover Club.

I came here for a quick drink while waiting for a table at the sister bar across the street. Come here and not there.

Their drinks were inventive and great. I thoroughly enjoyed my drinks to the point where I almost missed my table at the other bar as I was taking a long time to savor them.

We ordered a quick appetizer of artichoke dip that honestly came with maybe 10 chips. Odd how restaurants think it's normal to eat dip like a soup considering you run out of chips with the first half of the bowl. We asked for more chips and were not told there would be a fee. They sorted it out but it's odd to not let us know about that.

However, the service was great. The host was so nice and accommodating.

The space itself has that hipster vibe to it, bar with tiled and wooden accents and speckled with antique-looking functional furniture.

Definitely coming back for that matcha cocktail.

This place is all around, fantastic! From the service, to the food, to the drinks -- so good. We tried a few things on the menu and all of them were delicious, so anything you choose, you won't go wrong. The mixologist makes great cocktails. The waitress we had was SO kind and delightful! Really just do yourself a favor and go! Can't wait to go back soon. This is definitely a place I would like to go to at least once a month.

*Drink review only*
Some of the best cocktails you might possibly ever drink can be experienced at Clover Club.
I've visited Clover Club several times in the nearly 11 years since it has made Smith Street its home.
The décor is very inviting and sexy with a speakeasy feeling allowing it to stand out among other businesses along Smith street. Perfect for a date or hanging with friends.

I'm sure I tried some bites when I visited in the past but my memory doesn't serve me well since it has been a while. As such, this review will focus on my recent visit whereupon I enjoyed their incredible cocktails.

Although we sat at the bar, there were plenty of tables (albeit occupied) and I think a back space through velvet curtains. Considering it was a Saturday evening, it was super crowded and the place where everyone wanted to be.

Because I arrived first, i was able to get acquainted with our bartender of the evening, Ryan, who carefully crafted and curated some of the most visually appealing cocktails (and mocktails) at record speed.

It was actually enjoyable sitting at the bar since it was adorned with all the necessary cocktail essentials--variety of bitters, beakers containing an assortment of mixers and a gorgeous herb and fruit/garnish display. Note, Clover Club is fully stocked to include an assortment of whiskeys, gin and vodka according to brand but for those who are beer/wine lovers, they've got you covered.

Their cocktail menu was thoughtfully mapped out per category such as Sour drinks, Tiki style drinks, Gin and more.
My head spun. That's when I closed the menu and allowed Ryan to decide for me. He was spot on after I told him my preferences--- I started out with the Green Giant drink.

Too pretty to drink, the Green Giant was a combination of Old tom gin, sugar snap peas, tarragon, lemon, dry vermouth. This had the wow factor, served over crushed ice and very refreshing. I typically do not drink Gin but this was a mellow variety and I felt it was necessary to keep the integrity of the drink intact rather than substitute vodka for gin.

My next drink was the Sun kissed Sour. Since I was seeking something different sans crushed ice, Ryan suggested this drink especially after I emphasized my fondness for spicy drinks. This was Chili-pepper infused blanco tequila, watermelon, lime, blanc vermouth, pink peppercorn. Between the two cocktails, this might have been my favorite. It was extremely delicious and definitely had that spicy kick to it. My final drink, Gypsy Rose,  was actually a mocktail. As the menu mentioned, at zero proof, it was a combination of Elderflower, strawberry, grapefruit, lime, soda. I'm a huge fan of Elderflower, both the liquor and non alcohol variety. Very smooth and delicious.

Some of the other drinks served to us were the Tokyo Drift which was a whiskey cocktail, an Old Fashioned made with Bourbon and a straight single malt whiskey. No complaints with these.

As we enjoyed our drinks, the incredible aroma of food, which was brought to tables and those at the bar, looked quite good.
Four hours and $120 later, we left satisfied, satiated and imbibed delicious cocktails at Clover Club.

Elegant, super chill, wonderful drinks/food make Clover Club a must visit establishment.
Absolute winner.

I came here for brunch on a cold, rainy day. Seating was quick and quarters were tight. The service was fast and, if not friendly, helpful and quick.
The food was pretty good although their selection was mostly limited to egg dishes. I had the eggs and gravy dish because they were basically out of everything else I wanted and it was pretty good. I would recommend this place and I would come back but I wasn't totally wowed or anything.

My hubby and I threw a baby shower in the beautiful private Parlor Room in the back of the Clover Club and we had a very good experience.

Pros:
- Beautiful, elegant, and tasteful space with 1800's decor and furnishings. We didn't want to just rent a regular office space and this venue really stood out
- No hourly/day space rental fee!
- Attentive and friendly staff. We worked with General Manager Justin and Susan with all logistics and they were always responsive. Our bartender Ashley was super outgoing and friendly and my guests all really liked her.
- We ordered Deviled Eggs, Cheese Board, Cured Meats, Pulled Pork Minis, Caprese Crostini, Stuffed Mushrooms. All the food was fresh, flavorful and came out in a timely manner. Our friends raved about the Pulled Pork Minis and Caprese Crostini.
- Wide variety of fun and delicious cocktails and mocktails.

Cons:
- The minimum gratuity starts the time your party starts. So if you wanted to order a round of drinks for your friends who helped set up earlier in the morning, that would not count towards the minimum. Our bartender was sweet enough to allow an exception and set it up once she got the bar ready
- If anyone wanted to order additional dishes from the regular menu, you have to move out of the Parlor Room and dine in the front dining area, which is frustrating because you don't want to leave the party

Details for Parlor Room (Sun-Thurs/Sat Afternoons)
- 45 people max capacity for private parties.
- The requirement is $300 guaranteed minimum gratuity on all beverages. This means a total bar spend of $1500 assuming guests tip 20%. Drinks can be rung as a cash bar (each guest pays for their own drinks) or open bar (host to pay the entire tab.) At the end of the party, the host must guarantee that the minimum gratuity on all beverages reaches $300 or that the difference is met from cash bar tips. All drinks are rung based on consumption.
- Food orders, and signed food contracts are due one week in advance of party. Please note that food is subject to 20% service charge, which does not apply toward the gratuity minimum on beverages.
- Saturday & Sunday afternoon events must be cleared by 6pm. You can get there as early as 10:30am to setup.
- You cannot use anything that punctures any surface, also no glitter, confetti, stickers, and no duct tape (or equivalent) on any finished wood.
- Tall ladder is supplied but not tall enough to reach the ceiling. Tall enough to reach high up on the walls though.
- Must supply the source and speakers if you want to play your own music at a reasonable volume.
- $25 cake cutting fee covers two small-to-medium-sized cakes or one really big cake. There is no fee for desserts like cupcakes and cookies, and they are happy to arrange them on one of their platters.

Food Details
- Recommend ordering 2-3 platters of stationary hors d'ouevres, plus the following amount(s) of passed hors d'ouevres.
- 4-5 pieces of passed hors d' oeuvres per person is considered light eating. 6-7 pieces per person is considered medium eating. 8-10 pieces per person are considered heavy eating, or enough for each of your guests to call a full meal.

Finally, we ended up spending $1096 for food (medium eating), $115 on bar gratuity difference (in addition to $175 for drinks to treat our friends who helped out). Everything came together, everyone had a grand, well-fed, and drunk time and I highly recommend Clover Club for private parties! Thank you Justin, Susan, Ashley, and staff for helping us host a wonderful and memorable baby shower!

I was highly disappointed in this place after seeing the great reviews. I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the bacon tasting (really tasty), huervos rancheros (average at best), egg sandwhich (very tasty) and the criossant french toast (very disappointing. had some type of lemon batter. not your typical french toast that you expect).

The service was awful. Our waitress was incredible rude the entire time. We were sat with no silverware, brushed off when we asked for milk and sugar for our coffee, and very inattentive. Every time we spoke to her it felt like we were inconveniencing her from her job. Highly disappointing and not a great experience.

Stumbled upon the Clover Club around brunch after visiting the amazing bookstore, Books Are Magic.

Clover Club's baked eggs were amazing and reasonably priced at $13. The toast was very fresh and great for dipping in the baked eggs.

The portion looks small via the photo, but it was a lot more filling than expected. Service was great and very efficient. If I'm in the area I would stop by for brunch again.

I come here all the time and have had almost everything on the menu. It's all so good! Drinks are really well-crafted (especially the pina colada and watermelon tequila drink), and be sure to order any specials. My favorites are the shrimp and grits, spicy crab dip, the squash tart, anything with a waffle, and the duck poutine. The new fall menu is awesome. The staff is really nice, always wear masks, and it's a really nice spot.

Super cool and high-class cocktail lounge in Carroll Gardens with a massive and incredibly inventive menu, great happy hour specials ($8 cocktails) and phenomenal space. Right across from and owned by the same people as my love Leyenda - both differing heavily in atmosphere but rivals in quality.

There's a huge selection of whiskey-based cocktails which I love as well as a ton of hot cocktails. I started with one of their happy hour cocktails which was good, can't remember for the life of me what it was though. Next I tried the "Sage Ya Later" (manzanilla and East India sherriesm mezcal, plum syrup, honey, Cynar, burnt sage) at $14, which was great and STRONG. The menu is in this hardcover bound booklet which is cool and Dead Rabbit-esque.

Physical space is awesome. Super ornate bar with a beautiful and romantic back room and some side tables. Service was okay but oddly slow, especially considering we were there on a Tuesday when there were maybe 10 patrons total in the bar. The cocktails take a while to make but something still felt odd about the service.

All in all, will definitely return.

Can't comment on the food here but the drinks are great and well thought out. The staff is very friendly and patient and will help you pick out a drink if needed. Service is a little slow due to the fact that each drink has some sort of garnish on it and they are served with not your typical straw and ice cubes. They have good specials during happy hour so that would be the best time to go. Good choice when looking for drinks in my neighborhood.

Cocktails Bar + Brunch Place? Yes please.

Me and the brunch crew are always checking out places in park slope. For a change we went to caroll gardens. Cafe Luluc next door was incredibly packed. When we came in, our hostess brought us to our our cushy, leather booth.

The decor of the place makes you feel like you drifted into a 1950s classy saloon. We all ordered cocktails. I highly recommend the coffee blends.

The food here was exceptional. I had the potato pancakes, and baked eggs with leeks. The potato pancakes are a nice twist to having hash browns for the morning! Also, we shared the baked clams and assorted bacon. I highly recommend the bacon.

Will have to come back for their night food! Cheers!

The only thing I'm disappointed in is not coming into this place before.
Tonight was my first night and it almost definitely won't be my last. The blue velvet lived up to its name - smooth and..."blue". Flavors well balanced and tasty!
Bar staff (Mauricio and Ash) were super friendly and welcoming - the best part of it all!

Work in the area ..so of course, i Will be returning!

UPDATE: Returned the next day (tonight) for dinner and was blown away - again. Service was on point - Pedro was a great addition, alongside Mauricio. Steak frites were bomb (as expected)and Mac and cheese was amaaaaazing. Both dishes make me never want to be a vegan...ever. Like, it's not even a thought.

Xoxo

Been here before, and it still has the charm. For starters, who can say no to an awesome happy hour? $8 cocktails? Sign me up. And these are proper cocktails. Though, I did notice the full price drinks were a bit swankier.

The décor is a bit rustic meets vaudevillian, haunted mansion? That description made no sense. Think Sleep No More, or what-have-you. Old ornate couches and chairs and such. Anyway, regardless, I dig it.

My HH drink was seasonal and gin based, but had the feel of an old fashioned given the vermouth. I dug that. And my second drink was on the fruitier side, but not too sweet. Well done, bartender. My two friends felt the same about their drinks.

It's not the hyper-focused, super-attentive, wildy-creative type of cocktail bar that asks what you like and creates crazy concoctions, but it's certainly a destination worth traveling to and it delivers in every way that truly matters.

A bit overpriced, but a great whisky selection and quality food options. Highly recommend as a stopoff place in the area.

4.5 stars. Clover Club is a powerhouse of an establishment, one that I've been hearing about for years now. I live on the UWS in Manhattan so when I first learned of this place, I think part of me assumed/feared that I'd never make it here. A far off place in a faraway land. As it turns out, Clover Club is actually far closer to my apartment than most other places in Brooklyn and I am very pleased with myself for figuring out my error. A college friend of mine used to bartend in the East Village and once raved to me about how this was one of the premiere cocktail bars in Brooklyn. I don't forget statements like this and thank goodness. Everything about Clover Club is fantastic. The ambiance is as good as it gets, the cocktail menu is comprehensive and diverse, and the food is far more sophisticated than your typical bar fare. An easy bet for a date, Clover club is a warm, lively, intimate bar that feels like an elegant study/social club without any of the pretense.

We came to Clover Club at 8:45pm on a Saturday night. Originally, we had planned to get dinner at a more polished restaurant, but I got cold feet last-minute and decided I wanted to find a cocktail bar that just happened to also have a full dinner menu. Enter Clover Club. Just steps from the F train (perfect for a freezing night), has been thriving for a number of years. Classy and inviting, CC features two rooms, each of which has its own appeal. The front has more of a typical "bar" feel plus lots of tables for food service, while the back features a fire place and a smaller bar.

Though this is a popular spot, we only had to wait about 10-15 minutes to get a table. It's worth the wait, and you can stand at either bar while you wait. And if you do have to wait, you'll have ample time to look at the drink menu, which requires some real studying.

All drinks here are as good as it gets. Expert crafts(wo)/manship here. Everything is pristinely executed and the range is outstanding. The drink menu is split up to help your decision-making process: Sours/Cobblers, Royales, Gin Fizzes, Hot Drinks, Flips/Nogs, Punches, Stirred/Spirit-Forward and "The Reserve". Of the Sours/Cobblers, we tried the Clover Club (Gin, dry vermouth, lemon, raspberry and egg white), What's Up Doc (Dried currant-infused rum, carrot, lemon, orange, ginger, maple, allspice bitters) and the Kentucky Punkin' (Bourbon, spiced pumpkin butter, Palo Cortado sherry, lemon, Angostura bitters). All three are fantastic. The Clover Club is light, fruity, frothy and perfectly balanced. The What's Up Doc is served over crushed ice in a tall class, powerful, flavorful and exciting, fruity and aromatic. The Kentucky Punkin is more decadent but not as heavy as you'd think, yummy and wonderfully seasonal. Of the other categories, we tried the a Gin Fizz, Holland Tunnel (Genever, pineapple, ginger, lemon, Angostura bitters, soda) which I was fawning over. The prevailing flavor was so tasty. Was it the pineapple? I don't know. Yum.

Our nightcaps were more spirit-forward. I love dark drinks at the end of the night, and both were outstanding. We went with the Log Cabin (Hazelnut-infused boubon, apple brandy, maple syrup, Angostura and aromatic bitters) and the Bonfire Old Fashion (Bulleit bourbon 10 year, Michter's Toasted Barrel Finish bourbon, vanilla demerara, Braulio, cherry wood smoke, bruleed marshmellows). Similar style, both rich and warming. The first is nuttier and a little bit sweeter, the second is smoky as you'd expect but not peaty.

As I mentioned, the food menu is nothing to scoff at. Not as exciting as the drinks, but still impressive. Approachable dishes with a decent amount of variety. Eats, below:

Deviled Eggs w/ crispy bacon croutons, paprika and garlic bread crumbs, pickled pepper relish and mushroom duxelles: A-
The least exciting of the bunch but still tasty. Served four ways, I'd say the mushroom variety was my favorite.

Brussels Sprouts w/ romesco sauce, bacon and maple vinaigrette: A
I can't resist a bowl of perfectly crispy Brussels. The table next to us hard ordered these prior to us sitting down, and the decision was already made. Straightforward and wholly satisfying.

Grilled Octopus w/ heirloom beans, curry parsley oil, red cabbage braising jus: A-
The octopus itself was a bit overcooked but not that bad. A nice preparation, though. Seasoned well, good flavors, very warming.

Beet & Dill Cured Salmon w/ chili whipped avocado, cured egg yolk, chives, lemon creme fraiche, "everything bagel" spice, brioche toast: A
Beautiful presentation and seriously delicious. I know it looks like there's too much going on here and some might argue that indeed there is, but I still enjoyed this a lot. A creative concept with a great balance of textures and flavors.

Grilled Baby Lamb Chops w/ lemon chimichurri, dried cranberries and hazelnuts: A
Tender and rich with nice seasonal ingredients. This was the bf's favorite. Great presentation and *loved* the nutty accompaniment.

The Clover Club Snub

Gave Clover another go.  My friend and I arrived to a fully seated bar but empty tables.  We asked for a table becuase we intended to have dinner and drinks but the waitress refused to sit us at a table so we resigned to accepting 2 seats in the back with a small side table.  This made it impossible to be comfortable because my friend had a broken arm in a cast.  I tried to explain to the waitress a few times but she was to busy being gorgeous instead of considerate and walked briskly walked away when I tried to gently introduce the subject.  She insisted each time that tables were reserved for a a minimum of 4 people.

We were so annoyed that we finished our martinis and went to Nobu for dinner instead.

Clover fails again.  Too bad, we would have gladly tipped her 30% had she treated us as valuable clients, but I'm not going to spend $600 at an establishment where I'm treated like a second-class citizen.  I will admit the martinis were excellent though, even if the service left a bad aftertaste.

We got the Clover Club Snub once again!

I had the pleasure of meeting expert Mixologist Julie Reiner twice this year; once at a workshop she spoke at in Union Square, and once at a party at House of Yes where she was making cocktails in a secret hidden mini bar.  Both times I found her to be approachable, friendly, and down to earth, and only too glad to share her life experiences in verbal and liquid form.

What she has helped to create and maintain here at Clover Club is beyond reproach, and anyone looking to pilgrimage to NYC for serious cocktailing (like my best friend who was visiting from Baltimore when we came on weds 7/3) needs to make this a spot on their short list.

The charm of this place is unparalleled - from the corrugated tin ceilings to the dark rich leather couches, to the antique and hand crafted bar, and the lack of screens, this is the ideal atmosphere to let the cocktails bring people together.

This was a Tequila and Mezcal day for me so I opted for the delicious Tiger Lily. The perfect balance of smoky mezcal and blanco tequila infused with coriander provided an herbal balance to the tart fruitiness of the lime and fresh mango, the pungency of the ginger, and sweetness of almond orgeat; a true representation of Tiki in its greatest form, served on pebble ice with delicious fruit garnishes.

My good friend stuck to his area of expertise: Gin. He enjoyed the eponymous Clover Club cocktail with its beautiful balance of sweet berries, sour lemon, earthy and savory vermouth, herbal gin, and decadent egg white foam - I actually had to restrain myself from taking too large of a sip.

I am coming back for dinner really soon - this menu has about 14 other cocktails I need to check out, and some delicious looking snacks.

Julie and team, you made a visiting Baltimore bartender very happy, and a New Yorker excited for a return visit post haste.

In Brooklyn? Want good drinks? Go there.

Yelp wants more words, but it doesn't need more.

Go there.

Great flavors.

Great construction.

Go there. Just go. Why do they want more info. Just go: it's worth it.

After getting turned away from a nearby brunch spot with a long wait, stumbled upon this relaxing restaurant on a Saturday afternoon. Trendy lounge decor with a chill vibe due to the large windows upfront. Got a table for two immediately.

To start off we ordered the Toast Plate ($6) to pair with our coffee ($4 each). Plate includes homemade jams and butter along with toasted bread. Bread is a little burnt, but the jams and butter are good enough to mask it. Coffee is your standard fare but comes with free refills. For the main course, shared the Croissant French Toast ($11) and Huevos Rancheros ($12). The french toast is certainly interesting - a flattened croissant filled with fruit and served with maple syrup. The dish is super soft and needed no help from the syrup. Huevos rancheros is a mash of beans, eggs, avocado, and tortilla all swimming in mole sauce. One of the eggs didn't have a runny yolk; otherwise a filling and easy to eat dish.

Service is superb, as water/coffee was refilled constantly, and plates were taken away appropriately. Not seen as a brunch spot but certainly should be.

Really liked the atmosphere here. Super cozy and romantic. Service is really good. Cocktails were amazing. It lost a star because the food was pretty sub par - felt like we were grossly overpaying for bar fare as opposed to entrees. We had the fried oyster app (it was ok, kinda shelly), fettuccine + chicken sliders for main course which were pretty disappointing (and small???). But the dessert (cobbler) was tasty and cocktails are worth returning. But in the future I don't think we'll be ordering big plates again.

I will say the cocktails are good but the service was very poor. I arrived with a friend and and we were at the bar waiting on another friend to come. I put my name down with the hostess and we waited roughly 30 minutes for our table to be ready. By the time our table was ready my friend was still 5 minutes away. I said this to the hostess and instead of seating me an my friend who was there she turned and gave owner table to another party who had just arrived. By the time the last member of our party arrived we had to wait another 10 minutes and ended up at a table designed to fit two people not 3.

Because the table was small and the bar was loud we had to lean in to hear each other. One of my friends caught her hair on fire in the small candle at the table as a result. Luckily she was fine but they did nothing for her at any point. We ended up putting out the candle. As the hostess came around to give us more water she spilled all over me and said that it was a result of not being able to see because there was no candle..... I wouldn't go back if I was paid.

Came at the start of happy hour and was very pleased with the drinks and bites!

For cocktails i had the Georgia Sour and the Northern Lights - both were amazing!

For bar bites we had the Crisps and a Spicy Olives. I would highly recommend the olives.

Quiet, not crazy busy and easy to enjoy a conversation with my party. Excited to come back to try more cocktails and food!

I went Tuesday during the night, it was a very beautifully decorated place and the ambiance was wonderful (I love dim lighting). My friends and I got the booth table in the center where the tiny steps lead to it, which I must say was a bonus to be slightly more elevated than the other tables. For drink I got the eggnog which was very spiked, and the steak and fries. Next time, I'll get the steak medium rare, because the well done tasted a bit burnt, but the sauce complimented the meat well. I also took a bread pudding to go, the top was hard and the bottom was softer. P.S the service was good.

Cute little spot!

Came here on a Saturday night around 10:30pm and was seated at a table promptly (which kinda surprised me to be honest)

The atmosphere is pretty romantic as its dark with dim lights and candles. The place was very busy and I would say that very loud, but thats whats I'm looking for in a bar! The back room is amazing and it has a (working) fire place which made this place super cozy!

I love cocktail bars and this did not disappoint! The cocktail menu was literally a booklet! Huge selection of house crafted cocktails and you can also ask for whatever you want and they'll make it!
I got two cocktails prices at $14 each (which is standard price, but you can get them for way cheaper during happy hour)
I got the blackberry fool which I highly recommend. Its gin, blackberry, vanilla, mint, cream, lemon and rosewater. I fancied a sweet drink and this was delicious! (Its not too sweet)
Then I got the parchment fizz which has gin, lemon, pear, soda and other things I can't remember. It was also a great refreshing cocktail. (I liked the first one better if you can only choose one)
I also tried the hot browned butter rum which was a hot cocktail. Really good. And I tried another gin soda cocktail which I don't remember the name of. Point being- the cocktails are fancy and delicious!

We also tried the beef burger and the chips. The burger came with some creamed cheese, caramelized onions and pickles.  Decent burger but I probably won't get it again. The patty lacked flavor and it was a bit too fatty with the beef, cheese and fried onions. The chips are house-made and fried in duck fat. $16
They have a lot of food and a lot of starters so I definitely want to try other things next time I'm here!

I would also suggest coming here for brunch!

Also super friendly staff and was very helpful.

The Clover Club Snub

Gave Clover Club another go yesterday.  My friend and I arrived to a full bar but empty seating.  We intended to have dinner and drinks but the waitress refused to situs at a larger table we requested because my friend had a broken arm.  I asked nicely a few times and explained our situation but she snubbed us and was super adamant about not giving us a more comfortable table and insisted all of the empty table were reserved for 4 or more people. We were so annoyed that we finished our rounds of martinis and went to Nobu for dinner instead.  Clover fails again.  Too bad, we would've tipped her at least 30% if she had been accommodating but I'm not going to spend $500 on a night out in a place that treats me like a second-class citizen.  The martinis were good though, even though the service left a bad aftertaste.

We got the "Clover Club Snub."

Update: The staff reached out to me on Yelp and sent me a sincere apology for the experience.  That meant a lot to me.  It's reassuring to know they're self-aware and focused on improvement... so I'll give it another go at Clover.

I've been frequenting Clover Club for almost a decade now.  You could even say I was a fan.  I've brought dates, coworkers, clients, family, friends visiting from out of town and local ones.  I hesitate to describe the food as "food" --"cuisine" seems more fitting.  The plates never disappoint.

The small bites, such as the steak over toast, is my favorite pair with an Old Fashioned (Char grilled octopus with the Pinot).  I have a friend who is legitimately addicted to the Fried Chicken (It's tasty).  The Lamb Burger with Goat Cheese and the Fizz cocktail with Gin & Lavender take me back to my days as a student in Provence.

Speaking of cocktails, they are expertly crafted by friendly bartenders who take pride in each glass served with precision and speed that defies belief.  I've done some restaurant work and know professionals when I see them.

The only Achilles heel I can see here are the hosts.  Of all the nights I've spent here, I've only had enough negative encounters with a host to count on one hand.  I understand how difficult the customer service aspect of restaurant work is and the pressure that hosts are under so I usually let any rudeness slide.

Yesterday I invited a special someone to Clover for a uniquely special occasion.  She arrived a few seconds before I did (I was halfway down the block and saw her enter).  When I caught up with her at the hosts stand I learned that she wouldn't seat us until we'd both arrived.  I understood this as the restaurant's usual policy but what shouldn't be the usual policy is rudeness.  I don't expect to be treated like royalty as a customer but I can't stand being treated like a second class citizen.  Was this a "Starbucks Situation"?

How you say something is at least as important as what you say.  This host Melissa snapped, ordered my date to "Wait at the bar" in a stern tone, cut her off, and quickly ran away as my date tried to explain to her that I was walking through the door --as I walking through the door.

Unacceptable!

I've spent some great evenings at Clover Club and at their events at Governor's Island (not to mention a few thousand dollars) over the years.  Until yesterday it was worth every penny.

Needless to say, I'm likely to leave those evenings in the past as I suggest the same to all of my friends.
