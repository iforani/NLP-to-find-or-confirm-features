Upgrading to 5 stars due to their consistently great service and delicious offerings.

I've been a regular here for some time now as I work nearby. For work lunches I love their savory crepes, simple baguette sandwiches, and even the salads. Occasionally, when I'm really hungry I'll order the steak frites. They have a happy hour so I sometimes come here after after work. They make a fantastic steak tartare that I love!

I hope to see them remain in business despite this pandemic.

Love this little French bistro in the LES/Chinatown border! I remember their previous restaurant Les Enfants Terribles as it was one of the first restaurants I went to in the LES when I first came to NY. Now years later I find myself working in the neighborhood and coming to this bistro. The crêpes are authentic and each one is delicious! They have pretty good specials as well depending on the day and the attached café is terrific for espresso or noisette along with fresh pastries.

Note that the restaurant is cash only while the coffee counter accepts cards.

I really like this place. It's a relaxed, yet a lil fancy French restaurant in a location without many of them around. You can get full service at the bar that allows you a good view of the place and outside. The cocktails are pretty good, but I haven't found one I really like yet.

- duck foie gras pate: I loved that this has a generous portion size. Great flavor and the bread is toasted perfectly! There is more pate than bread so make sure you order something else to go with the pate unless you wanna eat half of it plain.
- beef tartare: unfortunately a miss for me, the flavor is overwhelmed with paprika in my opinion
- beef rib: soooo good, falls off the bone, melts in your mouth, amazing flavors! The whipped mustard it comes with is really great too, not the usual preparation of mustard and I much prefer this! The veggies are soft and well-stewed.

Overall, I like the ambience and food is generally high quality. I find it a little pricey but worth it for the quality. Cash-only which is unfortunate.

Stopped by this cool little cafe earlier today to meet a friend. The host/waitress was super cool and very friendly. My friend and I ended up getting the crepes. The savory ones are gluten free!

Cute spot, glad I was able to check it out!

I absolutely loved this restaurant. We found out about it through a recommendation from a friend who has been going there for a bit. We had the kale and artichoke dip to share. It was light and delicious. I ordered the roasted chicken and potatoes and it was perfect for a cold winter's night. The staff was lovely, the restaurant is small and intimate. It is a cash only restaurant but if you forget they have an ATM in the back.

This is one of those restaurants that NYC used to have a lot more of, but the city has become lost in the chain restaurants and small tapas portions. It's a rare gem and the food is incredible!

Overall we had an awesome experience and will be coming back!

This is an amazing, amazing bistro! I would say that it is a typical Parisian bistro except it is much, much better. I would gladly walk from Montparnasse to Montmartre (and back) to partake. I doubt I would pass a strictly better bistro.

I live in Morningside Heights, so visit Les Enfants less than I would like. If I lived closer I would be there constantly. Naturally I like some things more than others. But I think that's mostly about me, not them. The quality of the food and drinks covers the full range from exquisite to sublime.

If I had only one dinner remaining on this earth, their two bridges cocktail, winter greens salad, boeuf carottes façon grandmère, and tarte tatin would be a serious candidate for how to end this journey.

Try les Enfants. Bring your friends. As much as I am anxious that it will become so hot that it becomes hard to get a table, better that than have it disappear because of too little business.

On my honor, this is a thoroughgoing delight!

I made a reservation. It started to get busy by 12pm on a Sunday so a res is definitely a good idea. The menu was just the right size and had enough variety to please any craving.

I got a savory crepe with tomato, goat cheese and arugula with an egg added on top. It was delicious. The crepe/bready part itself tasted delicious. I ate it all. The coffee was good as well with continuous refills. Service was excellent.

It's a quaint little local spot with good food and a comfortable setting.

A reasonably-priced, low key and cozy, authentic French restaurant: how is this spot not overrun with people? If you want great service, and spectacular food then go here!! Or don't because my partner and I would love to keep it our secret. 4 visits in and we're still as happy and impressed as ever.

Don't forget cash!

Still the same wonderful, classic French food, excellent and tasty cocktails and great service.  And outside to boot!  I know it is a necessity and although I live in the Bronx now I will still try to visit and dine as often as I can with friends.  Maybe they can pitch a tent with some heaters for winter dining al fresco? Worth a trip on the D train from Bedford Park for the food and atmosphere.  I hope you stay forever.

Sunday boozy brunch for power of one, please.

A long holiday weekend summons self-care to just be.  The reviews are indeed paint an accurate experience for food and service excellence.  This French bistro embodies a classic bistro in a New York environment. This business is easily accessible by F train at East Broadway station in Lower East Side walking distance on Henry Street intersecting Jefferson Street.  I am glad Yelp search enables me a good find as I was very inclined.  Around the corner there is a annex for a bakery in true Parisian French fare bakery in the front, cafe in the rear.  My male server was doing it all as a very capable, competent, able-bodied man who was "running around like a chicken with its head cut off" as hostess, waiter, bus boy, cashier, etc. as he was operating the business alone.  I valued and appreciate hard work, efficiency, effectiveness, attentiveness, respect and professionalism which my male server exhibits all.  My bill total $29 as Eggs Norwegian is an added $2 to the boozy brunch set price $27.  The bill is served on a actual used vintage postcard with a foreign postage stamp.

LES Eggs Norwegian + $2
Two poached eggs, marinated salmon, Hollandaise sauce served on English muffin, salad and roasted potatoes.  It was enticing delicious!  The Hollandaise sauce was refreshing as it was light.  The two poached eggs were prepared well as the running yolk was oozing onto my plate very well and fresh.  It is extremely pleasing soft and prepared well.  The roasted potatoes were good side portion but slightly harden perhaps overcooked and slightly dry which I had to use salt for condiment.  The side salad was very light and refreshing as it contain sufficient dressing without drowning.

One brunch cocktail (included)
Mimosa was delightful but contain pulp from orange.  I do not like pulp in drinks.

I substituted coffee for mint tea by Bio Tea Malongo which was very aromatic and fragrant.  I am enamored of this tea.  The aroma fragrant enable to de-stress mind, body and briefly cleansed my spirit. This tea was aromatherapy than sipping for hydration.

Note:  Cash only and there is a ATM machine inside.

This was my first time having French food. I was just in the area looking for a quick lunch and stumbled upon this place. There's sitting area and aesthetic of the restaurant is great, especially if you're looking for a quick date, consider it here. The flavoring of the food is strategic and exquisite. Good service and was able to answer all my questions as well!
Things to note:
- seating arrangements are a little close to one another
- cash only!

I ordered a lunch special for $12 which is half kale salad with a yogurt Caesar dressing and half of a sandwich with fig spread and goat cheese.

Omg. Have been here for dinner and always loved it but never for brunch until today. The brunch menu is amazing. The savory crepes made with gluten-free buckwheat flour are amazing. And the brunch menu has something for everyone. Plus great drinks. The outdoor seating is relaxing, away from the hustle and bustle so be sure to hit this place up before the temps start to drop.

-love the space, it's perfect for coming in and getting some light work done but also coming back at night for happy hour to get your pre-game on.

-food was good. I got the croque madame, very fresh and light but with all the cheese and bread goodness.

-service was attentive and friendly.

The only thing I was bummed about was not being able to order some crepes because that part of the restaurant was closed. (?)

I will be back to try those for sure.

TLDR: Very authentically French. Amazing food and cocktails. Reservations on Yelp recommended at night. Overall rating: A

2 friends and I came here at 7:45pm on Thursday to celebrate my friend's work accomplishment. Easy Yelp reservation. Do make a reservation. It was packed for a Thursday night. Our table was reserved for us so we were seated immediately. Only 2 servers working here. They tend to the hungry crowds with ease. Cocktails took a little while due to the crowd but worth the wait. Here's what we tried:

-ASSIETTE DE CHARCUTERIE ET FROMAGES (Prices vary from $13 for 2 items to $24 for 6 items): We picked 6 items for $24. We chose 4 meats and 2 cheeses. I don't remember the names of everything unfortunately. The ones I do remember are: brie, tomme, saucisson, Parisian ham, chorizo. My favorite was the tomme cheese (French hard cow's milk cheese similar to manchego and topped with honey). The honey really brought out the nuttiness of the cheese. My second favorite was the chorizo. So good! My least favorites were the young brie with notes of grass and the Parisian ham, which wasn't special to me. The only thing that was missing was a good French Dijon or grainy mustard. The board also came with fresh baguette and chopped cornichons. A

-LA MOULE COQUINE DU CHEF (Chef's special, steamed mussels + savory broth) $19: Today's special was moule frites with dijonaise broth, served with fries. I sampled my friend's dish. Very delicious broth and fresh mussels. We needed to ask for bread to go with the mussels. No bowl provided for the discarded shells. We just used the appetizer/bread plates. I'm not a huge fan of mussels but my friend loved it. B+

-BOEUF CAROTTES FAÇON GRANDMÈRE (Slow-braised beef, carrots, pearl onions, mustard mousse, red wine reduction + baguette crumble) $27: Grandmother's recipe! Tender and flavorful. I don't like carrots to begin with so can't really judge them appropriately. Very tasty but next time I want to try the steak! A

-LA COUPE DU BOUCHER (Choice strip steak, celery root purée, sautéed haricots verts + beef-reduction jus with wild mushroom) $27: VERY GOOD! The best entree of the night! Perfectly cooked medium rare as requested. A+

-APEROL SPRITZ $12: Aperol and prosecco served over ice. Perfectly fine but the blood orange aperol spritz at Essex restaurant nearby is still my favorite! A

-PEAR BOTANIQUE (Pear and rosemary-infused gin, Amaro Montenegro, lemon juice, Peychaud's bitters, with a splash of prosecco, garnished with mint) $13: My 2 friends got this and were blown away. It was a little too herbal for my tastes. B+

-LE SPA (Gin, muddled cucumber, mint + splash of Prosecco) $12: My friend got this and really enjoyed it. It lives up to its namesake. Tastes like a spa in a glass. Too heavy on the cucumber for me but my friend adored it. B+

Best part is this place gives you unlimited bread baskets at your request. Happy hour is available at the bar only from Monday to Thursday, 4pm-7pm. This place is CASH ONLY! So come prepared. There's an ATM inside as well. 2 clean single occupancy unisex bathrooms in the back.

I'm in love with this restaurant! It reminds me of my favorite bistro in Paris. They're both casual, homey, with blackboards filled with delicious specials of the day. This place has excellent cocktails too. We will definitely be returning. I really want to try their crepes next time!

Coffee was good (very important).  I kept it basic with two eggs over easy and side of bacon.  The bacon side was amazing in itself.  First, normally a side costs a lot and you get little.  This place got it backwards.  Second and more importantly, it was very tasty.  I couldn't finish it.  The eggs cooked perfect and I enjoyed my meal.  Service was friendly and comfortable.

I came here with a group of friends for Sunday brunch and it was disappointing... I really want to love this place because of the high reviews but it ended up not being great.

Matcha latte: it was clumpy. The matcha wasn't dissolved properly and it had lots of clumps. I had to keep stirring to dissolve it myself.

Orange juice: $5 for a small glass filled with ice and not fresh squeezed juice.

Steak and eggs: my boyfriend asked for medium steak and it came almost well done. It was hard to chew.

Eggs Benedict with salmon: my poached egg was well done, it wasn't even runny. That just killed the whole point of eggs Benedict. The salmon tasted soapy for some reason. The highlight of my dish was the potatoes and salad that came with it, it was very good.

Country bacon side: for $5 it came with a very generous amount, but it was way too salty.

My friends had the regular eggs Benedict with ham and bohemian scrambled eggs. The bohemian eggs were salty and the eggs Benedict with ham was okay.

Overall, I won't come back for brunch but I will try dinner service one day.

We were in the neighborhood and came here as a random Yelp find on a Tuesday night, and were super glad that we did.  The food and service were both excellent.  The Tartare Du Bled was absolutely fantastic, and a great deal given the quality/amount.  The cocktails were quite good, and the service was both fast and very nice/pleasant.

I'd highly recommend dropping in, I'll be back just for the tartare.

This was a wonderful experience for my friend's birthday brunch. The staff was accommodating: we were running late and had to move the reservation back 30 mins and there were 11 of us. Not a problem! The interior is very pleasant - everyone commented on the mural on the back wall. Most of the party had some form of Eggs Benedict (with salmon, ham, etc.) I had the Croque Madame, which was absolutely delicious! Two friends ordered mimosas and they were quite strong! Prices were very reasonable for the good amount of food and drinks we ordered. Only gripe is the cash-only policy but their great service and food make up for it. Plus there's an ATM inside!

A really nice, little French restaurant in LES. The ambiance is very mellow and low key, and I love the exposed brick and super French mural drawing on the walls. The dinner menu is not very expansive, but they have very good options for all of your favorite French staples. I got the duck confit and it was amazing. It was served with white beans, dark greens, a puree of some sort, and a delicious, slightly sweet sauce. I definitely want to come back to get the duck again (hopefully they will serve the duck breast that night,) as well as to try the camembert and mussels.

Lifted straight out of Paris, Les Enfants de Boheme really nailed it with the live music, low key ambiance, amazing food and friendly server. It's everything you want in a tapas bar in NYC, but better. To start off, the space is large and the decor is fantastic. The cocktails were delicious - cheers to that two bridges. The food on the other hand is one of the best! The steak tartare was delicious, especially with the aioli and toasted baguette. Beef carrots was good, although I wish it the chef was more generous with the crunch topping. Mussels and house baguette were out of this world. The pro tip is to dunk the bread in the lovely light seafood cream sauce. The waitress supplied us with three basket of baguette which they buy and bake everyday.

The restaurant is amazing in its own way. Lots of locals. I will be back.

I was in the area for an art gallery opening and happened to stop here for dinner after since it was nearby. Be aware this place is CASH ONLY but they do have an ATM in the back. We got the cucumber salad to share and it was pretty good, but the mussels I had for my entree could have been much better. They were tiny and over cooked with broken shells throughout. Not sure how this place has 4.5 stars. Maybe brunch is better?

Fantastic spot on the LES.

Came here with my parents and my toddler for dinner on a Sunday and loved every minute. Authentically French, down to the no-substitutions rule (which the ladies at the next table did not appreciate).  Cash only.

We had the mussels which my toddler barely shared, the duck (confit that night), salmon special, and the cod.  All fantastic.

Great wine list, as well as interesting cocktails to start with.  I'll be back for another Spicy Gringo soon!

CASH ONLY! There are signs everywhere, as well as in a million places online. Again, the ladies dining at the next table seemed to have missed this part to so BRING CASH.

Live music on Sundays, we will be back for sure as my daughter loved bopping along to the music while we were eating.

Came here on a Saturday afternoon. My boyfriend and I we're lucky, we just got into the restaurant before everyone started to come in. Seats quickly filled up. The decor is very nice. We were seated near the kitchen and for some reason the lights around us was very dim, I wish the lights were a little better so I wouldn't have to struggle to look at the menu. My boyfriend and I ordered the Les egg Norwegian and Les egg Florentine. It came quick. I love that my eggs were runny. Highly recommend this spot for brunch

As a native New Yorker that grew up in the area, it's always amazing to me how the area has changed yet still the same. This little French bistro is situated in the middle of three neighborhoods. You have your projects on one side, Chinatown on the other, and a gentrified LES on the third side.

I came here for Sunday brunch and it was pretty quiet. I ordered the short rib Benedict and my girlfriend ordered the steak and eggs. The poached eggs were perfectly cooked and gooey. The short ribs were also quite tasty. I would say that the steak and eggs were just okay. The steak was done to the correct temperature but I feel like it was under seasoned and that choice of cut was a bit tough. It should have been marinated or prepped differently to give it more tender and flavorful.

As an FYI, this place is cash only. I would give them a 3.5 but a 4 because I can't and they weren't bad. Overall I'd come again but just to see what else they have to offer.

What a cute place - had a great dinner there last night. The duck confit (breast) was great, the steak was also great, and overall it was a solid meal. My friend had The Two Bridges cocktail which was delicious. I didn't care for the Pinot noir by the glass but the Bordeaux was nice. I'd definitely return.

Stumbled on this fabulous French find & I just had to write a great review. My husband & I shared a few plates bcs everything sounded so good, we couldn't decide what to have. The foie gras melts in your mouth, the kale salad was dressed with a wonderful yogurt-Ceasar dressing & the salmon was perfectly prepared atop a fresh vegetable salad featuring cucumbers, onions & tomatoes. Lastly, our server, Colin, took great care of us. We'll definitely be back.

We were in NYC visiting our son and asked him to pick a venue to have dinner Friday night. I could have not been more pleased with his selection. Les Enfants is an extremely cozy, little restaurant with incredible food! I emphasize that, as I am quite particular in what I like to eat. We had oysters, slow braised beef, duck and mussels plus a salad. The food was all totally superb, as well as the service, and we will definitely plan on returning there on our next trip to NYC. It truly is a hidden gem:) We recommend it highly!!!

I love this place and frequent, but give 4 instead  of 5 stars because there is a brunette female bartender who's not the nicest. Actually she's terrible and we always wonder how she even got hired in the service industry. She doesn't really engage with the guests and has a piss poor attitude.

I LOVE this place! The food is always excellent and the menu changes regularly. Farm to table, fresh, organic. The cocktails are also delicious and seasonal. And on top of that it's a community. You'll always run into interesting people you might have already met there. Can't say enough good things about Les Enfants!

I love the laidback vibe and food on this place. I think it is very hard in this city to create a place which has a genuine non pretentious vibe. Usually it is artificial.  This place is not.  I think you can go for a special event or to just have a delicious meal. It will work for both

Neighborhood gem!! I've been here many times for brunch, wine and cheese at the bar and dinner. You can't go wrong with anything you order. For brunch, I love the Eggs Norwegian, savory crepes, kale salad. For dinner, I enjoyed the kale salad (again, sooo good), charcuterie, duck confit. One time, we ordered the pan-roasted salted cod fillet and it was waaaay saltier than expected, but our waiter and chef were extremely gracious.. cleared the dish without a problem and removed it off of our bill. They also typically offer specials for brunch and dinner.

The coffee here is fantastic as well and there is a little coffee shop on the side for a coffee to-go and a pastry or crepes.

Great wine selection and knowledgeable waitstaff.

CASH ONLY but there is an ATM at the back.

Amazing. I can't believe we stumbled onto a magical place like this. Everything we had was absolutely amazing, from the foie gras to the mussels to the garlic broccoli. Everything was delicately prepared and very on point. Didn't take pictures because everything was gone and eaten in a heartbeat. Cannot recommend enough.

One world of warning - they don't take card!!! Bring cash.

This place is tres français and tres yummy. Showed up with my girl around 7 one night and it was almost empty, but filled up by the time we left at nine. Our waiter heard me pronouncing things properly so just spoke to me in French, which threw me for a loop and was flattering. Cash only; I think all this camr out to around $80 but I don't remember.

We split the warm artichoke gratin, which was decadent and very salty; the sautéed mushrooms, which were nothing special; the toast of the day, a delectable goat cheese-fig-onion thing; and the vegetarian special, a vegan eggplant fricassee that was good, and more rich than I expected considering it was a French restaurant doing something vegan.

Dessert was the crepe cake, which set a high bar for crepe cakes. Really knocked it out of the park.

Years ago, we ate at Les Enfants when they just open and wrote an early review.  Stefan and team continue to create an environment and community with a quality and value of food, service, ambience and experience that shows he and the team put their hearts and souls into the place.  It reminds us the best of towns in France where such gathering spots create a warmth and space that draws people together over conversation, music, sports and ideas while also providing great food, wine and drinks at prices that reflect fair value for both customers and the professionals who cook food, make drinks and enjoy serving.

Today we had a party of eight for brunch.  Whether it was the croques madame/monsieur, the burgers with brie and harissa, the watermelon mimosas, the coffee.....not a bite or sip was left on a plate, cup, glass.  And Tim and Stefan provided the kind of friendly and thoughtful service that typifies the Les Enfants experience.

Just wished we lived nearer so we could enjoy more often and use Les Enfants Delices as our "daily bread".

Bien fait toujours.

I'm a little hesitant to write this review because I don't want  my little secret to get out-- this little bistro is a local gem that rarely has a wait. The cocktails and food are all outstanding, especially for the price. I recommend going with friends and sharing dishes because everything is so delicious-- make sure you include an order of the moules du jour. The staff was also excellent and made the meal all the more enjoyable. French food may not be what you're looking for so close to China Town, but treat yourself to this one. You won't regret it.

One of the best places I've been on the Lower East Side. We ordered the gratin artichoke and a steak with carrots with whipped potatoes, and everything exceeded our expectactions. The beef came with a mustard-y sauce on the side: it's hard to describe how good it was. The cocktails were great too--recommend the Two Bridges. On top of everything, the service was amazing. (Marion, the waitress was super friendly!)

Stop in for the ambiance and the yummy food. And to see the dancing cutie "oppa"  bartender.  It's a surprise for this locale and neighborhood but definitely a long time coming.

This place has happy hour and a fun buy one get one drink menu (see special posted times).

I came here with my college buddy to celebrate my Belated Birthday. Surprisingly it was packed for a rainy and cold Thursday night. Given the nice vibe and cozy seats, we were warm and fuzzy by night's end. (Wines we tried: muscato, rose, and house white).

Apps we started with were bigger than expected. Both very good: Tartine of the day - ricotta and chorizo and the Artichoke dip. This was super garlicky but loved its texture and the toast points that accompanied it.

Dinner: my buddy went the usual way and ordered an entrée - stewed beef with carrots and onions. Excellent coloring and the veggies were soft. Beef was tender and rich in flavor. She was saving room for dessert so she doggie bagged half.

I went the non-traditional route and decided to do another app for dinner and a small charcuterie plate. The app I chose was Steak Tar Tar. It was plated generously in portion, and more of those yummy and warm toastie points. The tar tar was topped with a raw egg yolk just the way I like it. Only thing missing was some citrus or lime and maybe a sprinkle of sea salt to give it that extra oomph in flavor. So seasoning was a little light for my taste. But quality and appearance did not disappoint.

The cheese I selected for my 2 pc charcuterie: tomme and the meat I picked was speck. The tomme was a cow's milk cheese I believe and had a nice woodsy finish. Reminded me of a cross between swiss and like a nutty flavor combined.  The speck appeared dry but was not short of flavor and it was actually fine. I guess I've seen it more moist so this threw me off. Speck is a cured ham just a bit finer. I love cured meats. They have Serrano on the menu too but i couldn't swing a third choice.  Was getting really full.

For dessert we shared the apple pie for two. Make no mistake, not a portion for two but definitely a shareable dessert as it says.  Essentially pie a la mode for sharing but the crust is what makes this one so different and memorable. It's a must try.

I'd love to come back for their notable brunch and it's kid friendly despite the smaller venue and darker lighting. I spotted a basket of toys and books to keep the wee ones occupied. And they had a high chair.

Tl;dr: I literally made this yelp account to review Les Enfants de Boheme at a 5 star rating. Go check it out. It's amazing.

I had the Canard (I think it might have been the Magret de Canard). On top of a bed of Beluga lentils and sauces, the duck breast was seared to perfection, with a crispy skin and surface but a rare and tender inside. The chefs truly encapsulated the duck flavor. The lentils helped create a balanced palate against the heartyness of the duck, while the white sweet potato purée and duck jus exacerbated the explosive flavors of the fish. Each bite was a truly blissful experience. For $25 in Manhattan, the artisanal pairing of ingredients made this dish a canvas of flavor well worth every penny.

The drinks are crafted with an amazing blend of flavors too.

The decor and ambiance of this restaurant blends with the food. The atmosphere draws on heavy French influences. Whether you are dining or at the bar, Les Enfants is a perfect place for a date, celebration, or simply a nice meal.

The pictures don't do the food justice due to the dim lighting.
