I've been meaning to try out this restaurant in my neighborhood since moving here a few years ago and finally went last night. It always had an inviting appearance for a winter meal with a hearty Alsatian menu, string lights and a fireplace but in this COVID  winter, my new #1 criteria for places is a safe but warm outdoor dining option and this place delivered!!

They have adorable outdoor huts set up allowing parties up to 4 to sit on their own with their own heaters and air purifiers. It's honestly one of the best options in Carroll Gardens for outdoor dining on a cold or rainy night (last night was both and it was cozy and warm in the hut). They also have mulled wine with isn't on the menu but available if you ask.

The food was great. We got French union soup, tuna tartare, octopus and Brussels sprouts and everything was delicious. The service was also friendly and efficient. Would definitely recommend.

The best Escargot in New York!
If I ever see escargot on a menu, I order it. This restaurant has the best Escargot I've ever had. What a delight that they are open during Phase Two of NY's Reopening after COVID19. They are taking every safety precaution: tables in outdoor seating that are separated 6ft apart, mini hand sanitizer bottles at every table and staff that has on face masks at all times. As a healthcare provider, I saw that they went above and beyond to take every precaution. I felt safe eating here. Oh yeah, and did I mention they have the best escargot in NY? And if you get the Drunken Boat, you won't be disappointed!

La Cigogne is one of the best restaurants in the neighborhood. Great food, great drinks, great wine. Very friendly place to hang out, too. It's French/Alsatian, which means a mix of French and German. It's largely a French menu, but has German dishes that make for great comfort food, especially in the Winter (schnitzel; Spatzles (homemade egg noodle dishes)). When the weather's nice, they open the front and we love to sit on their deck. Since COVID, they've expanded their tables out front, too. We love La Cigogne.

I declare La Cigogne to be one of the best, if not the best, restaurants in the Carroll Gardens vicinity.
The past visits allowed me to try selections from their appetizer section such as the Tuna Tartare and Baked Camembert,  but I dined here two consecutive nights this week and am able to share a lot more.

First night, my friend and I shared the Alsatian Mac and Cheese, Goat Cheese Salad and La Cynara  Flatbread. Oh my word. Each dish was absolutely delightful.

The Mac and Cheese was creamy and cheesy without being overwhelming or salty. The portion was definitely shareable or great when combined with a salad which is what my friend did.
The salad included baby arugula, goat cheese, slivered Granny Smith apples and walnuts coated in a tangy lemon vinaigrette.

The La Cynara Flatbread (Tartes Flambe) was indescribably delicious. Presented on a stone board, it was thin and topped with chunky artichokes, spinach, toasted pine nuts, Fontina cheese and creme fraiche. Cut into 8 squares, this was also shareable. Definitely recommend everything I outlined.

On the second night, we chose the Alsatian Mac and Cheese and Baked Camembert as starters. Since I tried both, I knew they would be a table pleaser. Perfect winter comfort food.

For main, I selected the half roast chicken with mashed potatoes while the other selection was mussels with pomme frites.
While the mussels were given bragging rights, I was in love with my chicken. A generous portion that was so flavorful, juicy and bringing roast chicken to a new level. The mashed potatoes were creamy and garnished with a handful of crispy green beans. Outstanding. Two consecutive nights of solid, delicious and excellent food accompanied by cozy atmosphere and stellar service.

La Cigogne does everything right. And that's more than all right with me! See you soon.

I was very pleased with my first time visit to La Cigogne. I've passed by plenty but never dropped in.
Upon a Yelp search, we decided to check it out and I'm happy we did.

The restaurant has a few tables for  outdoor seating, but the atmosphere is more than inviting indoors. It resembled a quaint French bistro---very welcoming---however, we decided to sit at the bar.

With a Yelp check in, we received an entire flight of 4 different beers. Super surprised and although I don't love beer, i managed to enjoy two of the selections.
I wish I knew the bartender's name, but he was extremely helpful when asked questions and also offered recommendations.

I transitioned to a nice crisp Rose afterwards which was delicious.
As far as food, we shared a melted camembert served with a small side salad, honey and accompanied by toasted bread (about 6 pieces).
This was absolutely delicious.

I really enjoyed my experience at La Cigogne--mainly an introduction--and am looking forward to coming for dinner sometime.

The ambiance was beautiful, service was attentive and food/drinks---delicious.

Who can ask for anything more?

Love everything about this place. My sister and I went yesterday, but all of the tables were full. The manager asked us to wait a moment and he quickly setup an extra table for us! Our waiter (forgot his name) was awesome and had a lovely French accent. Ordered a few spritz', which were made perfectly. The Caesar Salad with grilled chicken was really good, as was the Norwegian (smoked salmon) Benedict. Needless to say, there wasn't anything left behind on those plates! Highly recommend you giving this place a try. I look forward to my next visit. Thank you for a fabulous outdoor brunch experience!

In the infamous words of Homer Simpson, "mmm... pretzel bun (sic)."

Want a few more reasons to visit this neighborhood French bistro?  How about great service?  Sure, the place might be run by a team of 18 year old food & drink wizards with no adult in sight... but whatever gets the job done, right?  The name we all cannot pronounce (?) means Stork.  "Oh that weird bird mascot and the related bird paraphernalia finally make sense," you say.  Mystery.  Solved.  You.  Are.  Welcome.  And finally, beer (see also, Homer Simpson).

As if I have not posed enough questions, how about this one?  Why do I have to visit an Alsatian joint to enjoy a Belgian beer with dinner in Brooklyn?  Because there aren't any Belgian bistros in this borough.  Argh!

What about the food?  The grilled octopus appetizer was fantastic!  The frisee, cranberry bean, and potato accompaniment was creative and delicious.  Bringing this all full circle, let's talk about Le Burger - which is French for the American "hamburger."  That pretzel bun was simply divine!  Throw on your choice of dairy (I am partial to cheddar), bacon, avocado, or mushroom - and voila.  The ground beef could have used some extra seasoning, though.  And I really miss the signature Pavel Kwak glass and stand that is the de facto gold standard as far as Belgian bistros are concerned.

"Eh, bien."  I googled this, so I hope this is the correct usage case.   Either way, I approve!

Delicious food,  fantastic cocktails,  and a comfortable seating,  on the street or indoors.   Flatbread was yummy.   Bouliabase was plentiful and flavorful and delicious.   Onion soup just so so.   Burnt on top.   Highly recommend.  Will come back for sure!

I love the food but the cocktails are  small  with a light pour ( the smallest in the hood).  So I may have to switch up my spots.  Feels like the bottom line is more important than  the customer.

I really like this place. The drinks were amazing and I had the burger with Swiss cheese and pretzel bun. Very good food and salads fresh. I liked the drink morning high. The place is cute and cozy and there is a fire place. It's a French cafe and is so nice. I would definitely recommend this place for dinner and drinks. Nice date spot or to gather with friends.

Love love love this place! Situated on a nice quiet street with a cozy outdoor patio, it's the perfect spot to enjoy some French cuisine. Food is absolutely delicious, wine list and cocktail selection is great and service is exceptionally friendly and attentive without being annoying. Never had a bad meal here and always look forward to dining here again! Street parking is fairly easy to find even on Saturday night.

Right away, La Cigogne has ultimately become my "restaurant-of-the-moment"- (after ditching my former fave, Bar Tabac). Everything I like is right here: innovative cocktails? This place has 'em. Style? Yep. Music? Very nice 'Chill' playlist. Plus, phenomenal prices and detailed service.

Decided on early Dinner considering we were already in the area and had wrapped up with a quick stint at the Atlantic Antic. Cigogne is low-key but with a dramatic and monochromatic design that I was really digging: Charcoal Dark Greys, Whitewashed Brick Wall by the Bar and a couple of Black walls- adding a funky touch of French chic.

Tuna Tartare starter was simple but tremendously delicious. My 'Ideal Mistress' and 'Spleen & Ideal' (or vice versa)cocktails were excellent and hit me after 20 minutes. Salade Niçoise, called for mustard in the vinaigrette and swapped it for a Balsamic & Oil dressing instead...Merci! This is where attention to detail meets coming back for more! While hubby enjoyed his medium rare Steak Frites and a beer flight (not part of the Yelp Check-In offer...just a sample of one) and included a Lager (I think) spiked with a French Orange Liqueur.

Mr. French Bartender was on point the whole evening and executed our cocktails with precision!!!!!! Merci! Service was very nice and apologies for forgetting Mr. French Bartender's name, but your cocktails rock! Based on reviews here, have to agree with Cigogne not being completely full but I felt we had everyone's undivided attention- especially, for an early Sunday evening.

This is by far the most unique breed of cool and nicely-priced French restaurant I've visited in Brooklyn in a while. Bookmark Checked off! It's a very nice first impression and right now, I'm having a serious moment with La Cigogne.

French food doesnt seem to be my preference so please take my review with a grain of salt.

Embiance... Dimly lit, wooden tables, dark church pews and iron seats. Jazzy French music plays and the smell of fresh baked bread engulfs the space. It's warm and intimate. Very inviting and romantic.

Service.... Friendly, sincere and attentive. But gotta say it was a Monday with only 3 tables.

Food.... Unfortunately, here is where they lost stars from me.

They start with warm bread. It smelled like a homemade biscuit but tasted like a baguette with a slightly softer exterior. It was really good and piping hot inside so the firm butter melted perfectly. I enjoyed the bread. And that was it. The meal went down hill from there for me.

Appetizer... Camembert Roti
Baked camembert with walnuts and honey. A side salad with potatoes and toast. The cheese was greasy and flavorless (and I love cheese). There were chucks of cheese floating in oil that just coated my throat. I was so disappointed. I wanted to like it. But I just couldn't enjoy it. I Searched for the honey but could not find it. The walnuts were bland but added a bit of texture (albeit mushy). The salad was okay but the potatoes were bland as well. They had great texture though, cooked perfectly. Overall, Not a fan at all.

Main course... La Chevre...
Goat cheese, bacon and imported honey on flat bread. Meh. I kinda feel like I could make this at home. The cheese was prominent and i like goat cheese. But I felt it was too chunky and crumbly. Not really a good balance of cheese to bread. The super thin crust reminded me of matzah and I wanted more melted cheesy bits and less chunks. There was just too much cheese in most bites. (Wait, did I just write that?! What!? But I digress).
The bacon was very good, it added flavor, saltiness and texture. No fatty pieces and not over cooked. And there was a decent amount. There were hints of honey which added a nice balance in some bites but it wasn't consistent. The cheese just overpowered all the other ingredients.

2 misses and no hits. I was done. I would go back for drinks or maybe dessert but I'll pass on dinner.

4 stars for the experience we had here while we hosted a bridal shower. The bride to be really enjoyed her time here and we were quite happy that management dealt with our shenanigans during the toilet paper bride dress challenge (we did clean up after ourselves after the fact!)

The staff at La Cigogne were very attentive and provided all the help we need before the bridal shower began, during, and after. I was surprised to see how big the space was. The restaurant manager was nice enough to allow us to arrive an hour before the shower started to set up decorations and rearrange some furniture to suit the theme. For a group of 20, I'm glad this place didn't force us to go with a pre-fixed menu; everyone was allowed to select their own meal. What was a nice was that the mimosas were consistently being filled by the wait staff. As far as recommendations, I recommend ordering a bit of everything and sharing it family style since on it's own the entrée can be a bit much to consume for one.

Things I tried:
- goat cheese arugula salad: I really like the goat cheese and wished there was more of it
- steak tuna tartare: It was a bit under seasoned; perhaps some salt and sesame oil will do the trick here
- mac & cheese: indulgent, cheesy & heavy; 100% recommend this as a dish to share
- croque madame: indulgent and also recommend splitting this sandwich with someone; or cutting it into quarters to share amongst 4

Casual and classy, chic but rustic, La Cigogne is the perfect mash up of a French backyard with some laid back Union St. vibes. This spot is just where I wanted to be on a Saturday night. I came here to catch up with a girl friend, but this spot would be cool for a first date or casual drinks by the bar. The vibe is a real crowd-pleaser. Onto the food and drink...

You'll get a free taste of their draft Alsatian with a Yelp check-in. This taster is quite a generous pour, served in a mini mason jar. Tres chic! The beer was pretty good too... so good that I ordered another after I finished up my first.

The bread basket - is it weird that I'm writing about a bread basket? If so, I don't care because that bread basket was so bomb. The bread was hot, buttery, soft, and super fresh. Honestly, if I didn't order such a big entree, I would have finished the second roll. But I needed to save room for my main and I'm so happy I did...

The burger - LAWD. I fell in love with this burger from the first bite. Perfectly cooked beef, a super soft and buttery pretzel roll (so many carbs, YAS), and some super salty French fries that paired perfectly with my beer. This burger was also HUGE but I devoured the entire thing because I'm not a quitter.

My friend ordered the tuna tartar app as her main and she definitely enjoyed it. And I trust her. She definitely has good taste. She did choose to hang out with me that Saturday night after all.

To finish up this meal, I ordered an espresso which was perfectly strong and a little frothy. I'll admit this was a bit fancy of me, but I needed help staying awake after demolishing that monster burger. Un caffè well earned, I think!

The service was fast and friendly. Everyone was extremely accommodating and knew exactly what to recommend.

My new favorite place in the neighborhood. Can't wait to visit again.

My mom threw my bridal shower here and had such a wonderful experience working with Damien. He was so quick in responding to all my emails that I was able to find and book this place in 24 hours! Throughout the whole planning process, he was such a great help in answering any questions I had.

We had an area in the back of the restaurant for the shower and we were able to decorate it with our own centerpieces/balloons/banners. They even provided a small table that we used for photobooth props and a guest book. It was a perfect space for a small gathering (we had 20 people).

Now, for the most important part: the FOOD. Oh. My. Word. Everything was AMAZING. She picked out the menu and everything was served family-style. She chose the goat cheese salad, tarte flambe les champignons, taste flambé vegetarian, french toast, mac and cheese, ratatouille, french fries, bowls of fruit, and a dessert assortment (creme brulee, chocolate brownie, apple crumble). There was more than enough food and everyone was raving about the food. My favorites were the tarte flambe les champignons and the mac and cheese - but everything was absolutely delicious. We also had orange juice/coffee/tea for everyone which came unlimited.

Overall I would definitely recommend this place to anyone throwing a party or just a place to eat! I look forward to coming back soon :)

Brought a party in from out of town to what used to be one of my favorite spots to drink.
We were having a great time until the bartender came to our table (in an almost empty restaurant) to tell us that we were being too loud.
I didn't realize we were drinking in a Library.
How embarrassing!
Do not come here with large groups OR if you are intending to have a good time.

1/30/2020Good afternoon Janine, thank you for your review. I am truly sorry regarding your experience that night. I really value our customers and their experience and after speaking to my manager, he was only trying to do his job and make sure that other customers (who actually complained to him) also enjoy their experience. I can assure you that he wasn’t trying to embarrass you or your party whatsoever and was just making sure everyone was having a lovely time. I really hope you ll take the time to review your review (as you may know, they really burst out business), and that you ll visit us sometimes again and enjoy the drinks that you enjoyed in the past. If you would like to contact me directly, my email is damien@lacigognenyc.com . Best regards,  Damien

La Cigogne has a casual yet intimate ambience with its lighting and decor.

The dinner menu was great. There were many appetising options. I landed on the red snapper and it was lightly seasoned and tasted great. The steak that my friend ordered came out medium-well, when it should have been medium-rare. We informed the staff and they rectified it immediately without question. The second dish came out to our liking. I appreciated their attentiveness to our concern. Additionally, the cocktail and drink options are great. The Clouded Sky was good. Also, the complimentary bread was delicious. I am pretty sure that I had two baskets alone.

Do not waste your time here!

My fiancé and I made a reservation for la Cigogne yesterday for 6:30pm. We took my in-laws to celebrate my mother-in-law's birthday. We were seated at 6:37 and did not receive anything but drinks until an hour later. Cold bread came out at 7:42. When we came in there was a family sitting next to us. They left and a couple then sat down around 7, their food and appetizers were served before ours even though we had ordered way before them. There were only 3 other tables on top of ours. We complained about the delay twice, and even asked to speak to the manager. He/she never came out or showed their face.  After our food came out, my father-in-law's burger was completely burned through. We sent it back, and no one offered him a new one or checked in to see if he would like anything g else. We received a complementary dessert aa t the end of the night and the burger was taken out oof the bill, but our night was ruined. They should have had more staff and the service should have been better. We were highly disappointed.

Wonderful spot for a date with a small outdoor space, but the doors can open which brings the outdoor in. The prices are a bit cheaper, but they have a great selection of cocktails. The schnitzel here is great and definitely fresh. We tried a little bit of everything being part of a large party. Most of the flavors were good, but needed a little bit of extra seasoning. Would definitely come again though!

This restaurant came highly recommended from friends of mine that frequent the place.

My dish was below par I got the pork schnitzel, my dining partner's dish was not eatable.

He got the fig flatbread which the waiter pushed pretty hard as the entree of the day.

My review of the dinner tonight is probably not indicative of how the other dishes are.

I doubt I would return.

6/25/2019Hello TJ. Thank you for your honest review and sharing your experience. I am sorry we disappointed you but may I ask you when this occurred since we don’t have fig on the menu and we only do it as a special during summer days (so maybe last year?.)

Please let me know.

Best
Damien

Went here for my mom's birthday dinner and it really was a perfect, intimate, yet trendy spot for a small family dinner. Ambience was great and the waiters were very nice and helpful with their recommendations. But now let's talk business... the drinks (and most importantly) the food!
- my dad got a fresh wheat beer which he loved. My mom and I both got their most popular drink on the menu- the ideal mistress. We totally get why it's so popular! Not too sweet and just strong enough.
- the French onion soup!! The only thing missing was the view of the Eiffel Tower. Baked to perfection and deliciousness.
- the tuna tar tar was very fresh and had a tin layer of avocado on top. It was served on a bed of thinly sliced cucumbers and a side of crispy bread.
- the crab cake was good but not my absolute fave. Not sure if I would order it again just because it was a little too heavy and too fried for my taste.
- the escargot was delightful! Highly recommend!!
- we also got the thin flat bread with melted Camembert, truffle oil, wild mushrooms, and bacon. Very good but as you can tell from the description it's a little heavy (which makes it that much more delicious)
- to top everything off, we got a creme brûlée for dessert. It was delicious. Caramelized perfectly on top and rich and creamy on the inside.

Definitely coming back to dine here again! Great food, ambience, and company... what more can a brooklynite ask for?

We, a birthday party of 8 people, had dinner here on Friday the 13th, and it was our lucky day! With the rain outside, the merry fireplace was the first lovely feature. The lighting is cozy (and very forgiving to a 70-year-old lady), the intimate room is inviting, and we were actually able to hear each other during lengthy conversations!
I enjoyed my delicious Spaetzle with wild mushrooms, others had  the half chicken, steak frites, and various other spaetzle dishes, all delicious. We enjoyed some Gewuerztraminer and each others' company. The service was attentive, and the overall experience will be remembered as very pleasant. Thanks!!!

My partner and I came here to have a few drinks and appetizers while we waited for our reservation at Lucali. It's a trendy, hipster bar that has a continuous playlist of jazz music. Seat yourself style and intimate enough for dates or casual enough for a group dinner.

My partner started off with a cocktail, a clouded sky, be drunk was fresh and tasty. I ordered the Kronenbourg a crisp fresh beer that was served in a cold mason jar.

They offer a small basket of complimentary buns which is great but they were stale and flavorless. I could do without them

For food, we ordered the charcuterie board. It came with Brie, Asiago, strawberry jam, honey, strawberries, blueberries, walnuts, salami, prosciutto, and a toasted baguette. This changes sometimes so make sure you ask what selections they are serving before ordering. The board was great. I enjoyed the flavors and the way they combined. After that we shared a hamburger patty which was greasy, burnt, and lacking in salt.

Later on, I ordered the beer sampler. Almost all of the beers were overly sweet and just not my taste.

Overall this is a nice place to go for drinks and hang time with friends, family, or significant others. They played Million dollar baby on the big screen and the music is great.

I would come back for the charcuterie and drinks

Really nice space and great food. I had the salmon and quinoa and a side of ratatouille, which was good but healthy. I tasted the flatbread which was amazing, and so was the seafood spetzle. The wine was a bit pricey at $12/glass. I would definitely come back.

Yikes.  As soon as I saw the fireplace I swore this would be the romantic night of my dreams.  Add to it that it was Valentines day and I thought the night would be great! Unfortunately.... it wasn't.  Food  was ok.. service was lacking alot.

We received  a full menu and a special one for the night. After agonizing over our choices, we were ready to tell our server what we wanted.  He then tells us that it is prefixe only.    Why not tell us at the start? (The couple who came ok after us had the same thing happen to them.) The choices were not that great. We finally picked  a second  choice. The salad was literally a plate of  bitter leaves. The portobello mushroom was better.  I then had the scallop risotto which was good.  It had alot of risotto for the three scallops. The duck with plum sauce and potatoes was not a successful dish.  My favorite part of the night was the beer sampler which was free with yelp. Dessert was a chocolate mousse (ehhh) and a berry covered meringue thing (ehhh again).

The thing is the service sucked. Hard. The minute it started getting filled, they couldn't handle it.  We had to call for our server twice who still didn't come over and then we had to go over to get him.  Unacceptable!!

Won't be headed there again.  Thanks but no thanks!

It's usually really hard for me to find a brunch food that wows my taste buds.

A friend found and recommended this venue. Visited on a Saturday, got there right when they opened so no wait time and the scene was relatively empty except for another party of early risers seated nearby.
By 11a/12p, traffic was def picking up.

I already viewed their online menu (&Yelp recommendations) so I knew what the deally was.

Staff were very Friendly and they speak French so feel free to practice with them.

The decor is cozy, there is even a fire place. It was raining cats and dogs when  I visited so the fire place added extra feel of warmth.

I had the mimosa, I am actually not a mimosa fan so not sure why I even ordered it with th grp.

Highlights of the meal was the Nutella banana pancakes, the French toast and the tarte flambee brie... Yummers. Def filling for a grp of 4.

I wanted to like the Tuna Tartare but it was too salty.
We also ordered the Le Petit dejeuner coubertin but were honestly too full to give it any attention.

Overall, I would recommend. Def with a grp so you can order several items and taste a bit of what's goodm

This place is TERRIBLE. This is a complete showcase of a bad chef. I felt like I was at an episode of Kitchen Nightmares before the make over.

Sadly, I chose this place for a birthday dinner due to  arriving too late to get a decent time at Locali.

I picked this place because I like French and it had good yelp reviews. Lesson learned.

Appetizers took 30mins to arrive
Escargot : burnt to a blackened crisp
Mussels: alchohol didn't cook down correctly so basically you had over cooked mussels in unreduced sauce
Noodles: over sauced and over cooked (notice a theme?)
The steak: I asked for Medium Rare and clarified w the server that it was a warm pink. What I got instead was perfectly cooked. Haha jking, the chef is clearly not that talented. It was a grey mess. (Sad face here)

Avoid avoid avoid. Unless you like overcooked food pretending to be French food

Edit: Another example, false response from restaurant. No one checked on how our food was nor did we get a new steak.

7/8/2018Salut Tim! Thank you for your review, we hope you feel better now that you shared your experience. We did indeed overcooked your steak, and I am trully sorry about that. We still served you a new one at the right temperature and after checking up on you I had the feeling it was right, obviously not? Again, im sorry about this temperature issue. As for the “noodles” (spatzles), this is the way they are served in Alsace. Im from there and this is how we serve them. I dont think this was worth a 1 star but as long as you feel better ....

Have a lovely evening, or not

Damien

This is an Alsatian bistro.  The tartes flambee are a nice light alternative to all the pizza in the neighborhood.  If you're hungrier, go for the steak frites.  Share the escargot for a change of pace and you won't regret.  Lucky for me La Cigogne is in my backyard and I can go anytime.

So I was trying to find a new place to eat near by and this menu looked amazing.
I walk in and was like oh whaaaa!? This place again?
Turns out I came here a few years ago. I couldn't remember if it was good or not though. Anyway, it's a romantic dimly lit joint. We sat in the back right by a speaker playing jazzy music for this whole place to hear. That made it difficult to hold a conversation and MAYBE it was hard for the server to hear what I was actually ordering. I definitely got the wrong dish. This thing had steak and mushrooms in. Two things I don't really eat. There wasn't one pine nut in it which, I know seems weird but that's my favorite nut and I'd honestly give my left one for anything with those babies in it.
I have to say though for not liking steak or mushrooms I ate almost the whole thing. Whatever it was I ate got taken off the bill so I can't really fault them too much, but damn now I just want to eat like a cup of pine nuts.
My husband ordered a steak and purposely ordered it like nearly raw...as if he were some sort of psychic he knew they would over cook it. Guess what. They did. He still liked it.
Everyone is super nice here though. You should check it out. You might end up eating something you didn't know liked!

9/22/2019Thank you for your honest review Joey and please accept my sincere apologies. It turned out that you received the Gambrinus (slow cooked beef stew with prunes, carrots and olives) instead of the Genova that you ordered. I am truly sorry for the inconvenience, theses things should not happen at all. If you ever stop by again, please ask for myself (Damien - I took your order of French Martini and Spleen & Ideal) and I will take great care of you. Best regards, Damien

My boyfriend and I seriously love this place! We've been about 4 times now and I'm not one to repeat restaurants with as many options as we have in NYC!
The interior has a warm, cozy feel with a fireplace in the back half of the restaurant. The menu puts a lot of focus on the Spatzle and flatbread options, so we've tried several. You can't go wrong with Le Chèvre, we order it every time. We've tried most of the spatzles as well, and my personal fave is the Kari with chicken! Appetizers Scallops and French onion soup are top notch! They put some focus on the Mussels apps as well, but I'm not too big on Mussels so can't comment there..
Such a small detail, but I also love that they always write a joke a day in the bathroom for something to ponder over the course of dinner.

We have been going to La Cigogne for years now and love it. The food is always good and the service is notably friendly. It's a great place to go with and without kids (they have lots of books and toys to keep children entertained).

Came here to kill time while waiting for our reservation at Lucali's down the street. Got some drinks here and small bites to eat.

I got the clouded sky cocktail and really didn't enjoy it. It just had a weird medicine taste to me since it oddly combined orange with a kind of spice/cinnamon taste. It just didn't sit well with me. I switched to Riesling after that and that was better.

Escargot was good, tuna tartar was good as well, but had a little more ginger flavor than I would've liked. We also tried one of the spätzle dishes that was like tiny gnocchi with mushroom and had a Mac and cheese look to it. Rich flavor, but not too heavy. Their complimentary bread was also very very good!

Came here on a Sat. morning, when they just started. At first, I thought the place is very cozy and had look of a cute bistro. But when I went it, it had quite large a good amount of seating and was bigger than I thought. The food that we got was pretty good. Their flatbread Pizzas were good, as well as the steak tartar. Also had their duck and waffles which was amazing. The chef does the food right here. Will def come again at different times to check out the vibe of the place at night.
Def would recommend.

I'm in love with this restaurant. I was lucky enough to go here for a tasting at the Taste of Brooklyn's Food Crawl event and the servers didn't treat us any differently than a customer who was going there for dinner. No other restaurant at the food crawl did that, so it made La Cogigne stick out and I'm dying to come back here for a full meal.

My friend and i got the artisan mac and cheese, an appetizer on their menu, and the tarte flambée de les champignons, which is a flatbread with mushrooms and brie. Both were delicious and they gave a pretty big amount for a tasting, which was great. I was left wanting more because both of them were soooo good.

Like I said, the server was really really nice. He let us sit wherever we want, gave us glasses of water, and checked up on us to see how we were doing. We got a full restaurant experience with great good from just a tasting event! I was seriously impressed.

I definitely recommend going here for a dinner date. The ambience is dark and romantic, and they had a pretty big bar as well. Can't wait to bring someone here for a romatic night out!

A French/German restaurant - not something you see everyday. Nonetheless, this spot took last minute reservations and had an interesting menu with something for everyone. Tuesday night and almost no one inside, so was able to secure a table for two on the patio outside.

To start off, got the Camembert frit/roti ($13) and a side of french fries ($6). Fries come in a deep fryer basket, extra thick and crisped well, just the way I like it. The Camembert dish is essentially a fondue; melted cheese in a pot with baguette slices to dip into it. The cheese includes walnuts and rosemary which added texture of the meal. For the main course, split the La schmidt flambee ($14), and the Nemrod spaetzle ($16). Flambee looks like a flatbread rectangular pizza with crème fraîche as a base, gooey to eat and balanced well with the ratatouille. Chicken on top is a little bland, which was fine since the rest of the dish countered it. Spaetzle looks and tastes like a spicy pasta with mushrooms, onions, and raisins - solid kick that was a nice reprieve from all the creamy dishes. Cocktails and beer here are strong and on point as well.

Service here is solid. Our waiter went through the menu as much as possible and kept the water filled. This is a great place for a dinner date as it's not a bad walk to the riverfront afterwards.
