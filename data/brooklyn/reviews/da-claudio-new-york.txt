Ambiance: 5/5
Food: 5/5
Service: 5/5
Covid-19 score: 6/5, bonus point for being dog friendly!

I'm not sure why it took me so long to visit Da Claudio, but I'm so glad I did and I can't wait to go back! The restaurant has outdoor dining across the street, the tables were close in proximity but I'm glad we had clear dividers. The service was top notch, our waitress Hannah was so sweet and showed my puppy Zeno (@go.zeno.go) so much love! Our other waiter (sorry I didn't get your name) always made sure my water glass is filled, talk about attention to detail!

Fritto misto: 2/5, will probably skip this next time
Black Linguine: 4/5, although the shrimp was a little soggy, the spicy tomato sauce was so incredible that I'm still thinking about it
Spaghetti Carbonara: 5/5, pasta was perfectly al dente and honestly you just can't go wrong with carbonara

Da Claudio's is excellent every time eat-in or takeout. It has become and absolute favorite of my partner's and mine during quarantine. Owner is attentive and servers are effervescent. Starting at the bar, there are incredible cocktails and a very nice wine selection.

The pasta is what I DREAM about though. I find myself craving the spaghetti carbonara and fusilli cacio e pepe with a side of their wonderful bread. Another favorite is the tagliata strip steak, always perfectly cooked to order. The restaurant has a nice rotating list of specials in addition to their solids.  I hope the veal scallopini comes back soon!

Although the outdoor setup was not the most aesthetically pleasing, it was fine and understand the many challenges the business is probably facing because of Covid. But, the food was great and our waitress was very attentive and helpful. I got the bucatini arrabbiata and it was delicious!

I couldn't think of a better place to take our son, after graduating School.

The food was phenomenal and the atmosphere was great.

Especially the Black linguine.

For lovers of Italian cuisine, this is a place to visit in New York.

Easy to choose the menu, flavorful food made with touch, and very-friendly staff of this comfortable restaurant.

Nice atmosphere inside, perfect for any occasions. You can't go wrong here.

I am a long-time fan of Da Claudio, which is just around the corner from work. I think I've had nearly everything on their menu at some point, but I like their heavier traditional offerings like lasagna and eggplant parm. I can't recommend their desserts enough, especially the cannolis--delicious!

These positives all apply to dining in, however. A while back I was in the area and ordered takeout to support a favorite restaurant. I regretted it. The lasagna and eggplant parm were both in these small takeout boxes and could barely be considered a serving. Dining in-house gets you big boat style plates with the dishes featured in the center and a nicely shareable portion, so it was surprising to pay the premium for both the lasagna and eggplant, but to still be hungry after we ate them. The Brussel sprouts portion (also the same size box) was generous and delicious.

What really got me was the drinks, though! I wanted to add a couple of drinks, again to support a beloved restaurant. They ended up charging me $17 for a plain Negroni! Seriously?  And the apperol spritz we got was similarly overpriced. I don't mind a $20 cocktail that is well crafted, complex, original and with great ambiance, but the cost here was ridiculous. I regretted ordering from there at all, but it was too late to cancel the drinks by the time I saw what they were charging.

The takeaway is to not do takeaway. Wait til the crisis is over and you can join them in-house again.

I finally had the opportunity to check off a place off my restaurant bucket list.  I made my reservation for a late dinner on Opentable. When I arrived at the restaurant the outdoor dining was setup across the street from the restaurant there were two tables designed for two people and the remaining two tables are designed to seat up to 4 people.

When I arrived, I had my water but they ran out of individually wrapped straws. The complementary roll cut in half was cold and hard so it was not consumed. I ordered the frito misto (fried calamari, fried shrimp and fried fish) and mango cheesecake.  My server was knowledgeable, pleasant and accommodating.

The frito misto ($23) was delicious, the appetizer was meant for sharing but definitely a great meal for one.  After finishing my dish, the server returned to clean the table, which was amazing especially during these times. The mango cheesecake ($12) was the perfect portion and a great ending to my meal experience.

I will definitely return to this restaurant to try their paninis, which I heard was huge.

This place has been on my to try list for awhile and I was thrilled when I realized it was around the corner from my brother's new place. We initially had planned to dine outside but it was a chilly night and after seeing that the tables were spaced apart well, we decided to dine inside.  We had a lovely table away from others but it was still nice to enjoy the lively atmosphere inside.  Great cocktails to begin, really knowledgeable and accommodating service.  They let us enjoy our cocktails, order and eat at a leisurely pace while also being very attentive but not intrusive. And let me not forget the food.  Salami/cheese plate and fried artichokes to start. Squid ink pasta and fettucine with sausage ragu for a mid course. And finally, sea bass on special and grilled octopus to end.  We loved the food, we loved the atmosphere and we loved the service.  We will definitely be back.

A very pleasant and surprising meal here! Came around 6 on a Friday night, there was a decent crowd but no wait. I was surprised at how big the space was, really liked the open kitchen as well. Decent happy hour deals as well that last until 7pm.

We started with the meats and cheese platter for two, fried baby artichoke (both a part of happy hour menu) and burratta which was one of their specials of the night. The meats and cheese comes with 3 or 4 types of meat and 4 different cheeses, two servings of each. All our appetizers were good, definitely worth getting if you're there during happy hour. I got kale carbonara spaghetti which was another special they offered that night and my boyfriend got the pesto gnocchi. The carbonara was good, spaghetti cooked al dente, LOTS of pancetta. The kale which is grinder and mixed into the carbonara sauce made the pasta itself taste less heavy, really enjoyed this. Although I didn't feel like it had a heavy kale flavor, but definitely tasted like a good carbonara. The gnocchi was cooked pretty soft, and pesto was strong. String beans was a nice touch to it.

Our food came out pretty quick, and the servers would take away our finished plates as soon as they noticed we were done. The waitress was also nice, came by a couple of time. Definitely give this place a try if you're around here and craving Italian.

While staying at the Beekman I found Da Claudio on Yelp. What a Wonderful restaurant the owner and our server Andrea were so attentive to us , Incredible appetizers and great meals had by all 4 of us. My son and his girlfriend had birthdays and they brought out candles and a birthday wish in chocolate sauce on the desserts. This was followed by a complimentary round of lemonciillo!!

Amazing place. Probably my favorite restaurant in FiDi. If you're going for lunch, get the prefix, I usually go with the Caesar to start and the wagyu bolanganse. Its $30 but amazing. Drinks are good too! The wine list is exceptional. The service is top notch. I would absolutely recommend anyone coming here.

Tip: it does get busy, despite it being hard to find, make a reservation!

The best part is the shrimp with head-on! Oh yea! Gimme all you got! So ok, I went downtown to meet my old supervisor and a friend who worked at the same office many years ago (across from the World Trade Center). She gave me a few suggestions and we picked this one. The manager (or he could be the owner) was a friendly gentleman who likes to joke, also a nice fellow.

Juliana was our waitress. She's friendly and attentive. We ordered calamari to share. The calamari app includes some fish. Then I had the black linguini with shrimp. My friend had salmon special and that looked super neat and fresh. My dish was unbelievable! The shrimp came with the heads on. I'm glad they didn't cut the head because I like the head. Did I mention that I eat fish head a lot too? Most people want to know the secret of my good memory. Fish head! That's the answer! You'll be thanking me for the rest of your life for making you remember everything that you try to forget! My pasta was delicious, I won't forget that. The sauce was very good. My friend liked her salmon dish. She said she's been here before and liked the food the last time she was here too. Good to know they're consistent. We both finished our meals.

The restaurant's pretty big with a high ceiling and we sat by the booth. I got a pretty good view of the whole restaurant. I definitely enjoyed dining here. I hope you do too!

A super authentic Italian restaurant in downtown MH! The place is nicely decorated with a modern chic and comic book drawings along the walls. The ambiance is nice and there is also a full service bar.
Food here is delicious and the open kitchen window allows diners to see inside their inner workings.
Bread with fresh extra virgin olive oil is provided for the table.
I had the cacio e pepe pasta which was amazing.
A bit pricy but definitely worth it!

We came here on a Friday night with a reservation. We were seated immediately.

We ordered the meat and cheese platter, steak, spinach, and octopus. Very delicious food! We had our steak well-done, and it was very flavorful.

The ambience was great - very big and open. You can even see the kitchen as they are preparing the food. Perfect place for a romantic date or catching up with a friend. I really loved the low lighting, the bar in the restaurant and interior decoration. The ceilings are quite interesting.

Servers were friendly although I found it difficult to flag them down at times. Bathrooms were clean too!

First time here and definitely had a great experience! They do happy hour from 5-7pm DAILY with great selections of wines too. I really like the decor and the atmosphere there. The server was super nice and the pasta dishes she recommended was on point as well. Really great pasta dishes if you're looking for great quality pasta.

Things I ordered:
- POLIPO: octopus, potatoes, olive tapenade, capers
- GARGANELLI: wagyu bolognese, parmigiano
- BUCATINI CACIO E PEPE: cheese & pepper

If I could give this 0 stars .. This is the worst Italian food I have ever eaten in all of Manhattan. I am better off grabbing frozen gnocchi and string beans from the supermarket, drowning them in disgusting pesto and calling it Da Claudio's. The staff is disgustingly rude it actually ruins the "ambiance" some people say is so nice. Did I mention it is super expensive? Well it is. I don't mind paying a little extra for some good, authentic Italian food. But this? God bless. Good luck not getting food poisoning. Enjoy.

Da Claudio came up as the most highly rated/reviewed/seen/visited spot for  Italian food over in the Financial District and as someone who was on a mission to indulge in the better things in life, I had to stop in here for dinner. I came in on a Sunday and it was pretty quiet within the restaurant. I was immediately sat in a cozy booth in the back, which was lovely. The entire atmosphere of the restaurant was very chic and elevated and contemporary but still managed to feel cozy and romantic at the same time. There were families with children, friends, and couples dining so this spot is clearly able to cater to anyone's needs.

The customer service was very attentive and friendly. Our glasses were always full and they checked in just enough to make sure that you had exactly what you needed without feeling overwhelmed. Everyone was incredibly professional and courteous. The menu was spot on and it was honestly hard not to order one of everything. I also love that they sell wine by the glass, half, and then the whole bottle. Their bucatini amatriciana is spot-on, especially paired with a glass of chianti. I'm determined to keep coming back until I try every pasta dish on their menu.

Randomly stopped by here and glad I did. Great place for a romantic date night or a casual dinner. The drinks were very tasty and strong, can't go wrong with the classic mule. Loved the cacio e pepe and with chicken added, gave it a great flavor. Would definitely stop by here again if I'm in the area.

I had a fun work lunch at Da Claudio last month while I was visiting New York. The restaurant was pleasant, nice and comfortable with an open, contemporary feel. I showed up with a cake, which the staff kindly offered to keep refrigerated while we ate. Service was good generally, too, friendly and accommodating and attentive.

The food was great. I had the garganelli with wagyu bolognese and parmigiano. This was excellent, the rolled pasta cooked al dente, the bolognese and cheese meaty and satisfying. I got a cup of blood orange sorbetto for dessert, and this also hit the spot exactly, just a light, refreshing way to finish my lunch.

If you're looking for a good Italian spot in the Financial District, Da Claudio seems like a pretty safe bet to me. I've only been this once, but I enjoyed my pasta and sorbet, and would definitely come back if I lived in New York.

The food here was pretty good, but we were just meh on the service. My boyfriend and I came here for our anniversary dinner. I decided to make a reservation, even though it's usually not crowded.

We were a few minutes late, but it wasn't a problem at all. When we sat down, though, the couple next to us told us that the waitress had overcharged them twice on their bill, so we went into dinner a little skeptical.

Our waitress was very nice, though. We ordered the burrata special to start, which was pretty good except it was mostly cabbage. My boyfriend ordered the bolognese, which was the best dish of the evening. The pasta was cooked really well, and the sauce was super flavorful. I got the spaghetti carbonara. I thought it was pretty good, but I've had better in the city.

We didn't order dessert, but the waitress brought over a tiramisu for our anniversary. We thought that was very nice of the restaurant, until I went to pay and saw that they had charged us for it, even though we didn't order it. I thought that was kind of strange service. Decent restaurant overall, but there are better Italian options nearby.

This place was hustling and bustling when we arrived for dinner at 7:30pm on a Thursday night. The service was excellent and the appetizers were delicious. The reason I gave only 3 stars was because of the pasta dishes. The ragu sauce was not very flavorful and adding salt or pepper just wouldn't be enough. I would return but only to have appetizers!

Across from the Moxy hotel sits Da Claudio. I've eaten here 3 times & the wait staff is excellent. I came here today with a large party and overall the experience was good. I ordered the Eggplant Parmesan and it was ok & was $22.00 on the lunch menu. The lunch menu is not cheap but it is average for the neighborhood & the portions are a nice size considering the cost. I enjoy the staff more than the food here but I prefer more hearty heavy Italian food & this is not that kind of restaurant. I might go again & try a different meal.

Food: I got the pasta Bolognese. It came as penne pasta with meat sauce. So yummy! Added extra cheese and red pepper flakes for more taste.

Price: not bad. $22 for my dish

Service: good service. Accommodated a 12 person party well. Even remade a dish when it wasn't cooked well

Overall- classy atmosphere with reasonable NYC pricing and a good quality meal.

Service: Phenomenal. Our server was pleasant, helpful and attentive.

Ambiance: Cute and quaint.

Food: Octopus was mediocre. Black linguine was a winner! The brodetto de pesce was sad, over cooked clams, shrimp and calamari. Appreciative of the chef's second attempt, but he or she still came up short. Tiramisu is a must.

All in all, I would probably give them another chance.

Recommended restaurant with nice ambiance, great food and amazing service.
Had dinner here last night with a party or 5 colleagues and we all thoroughly enjoyed it.
Our server Naomi from Italy was the best! So sweet and professional - she told us a bit about her experience in NYC. She was very attentive and made sure our glasses were full and kept checking on us.
Montepulciano wine, amaro, limoncello and a great tiramisu made my night. Will come back.

My son and I went to Da Claudio's on a Sunday night which was very quiet.  I'm so glad we found this restaurant.  We loved it and it was so nice to sit outside, have a couple of drinks, a delicious appetizer and dinner.  Everything we had was excellent!  The waitress was so sweet and asked us where we were from and to be sure to come back to visit them next time we're in town.  She was so personable.  I think she said it was her 3rd day there.  It seemed she'd been there for a long time.  Next time we make a trip to NYC, I will make sure to go there!

New York prices, but the service was wonderful and the food was above-average - so it was an overall enjoyable dinner experience for us at Da Claudio.

I loved that they had a quite a few specials on the menu (a number of which involved lobster - my favorite!), but I ended up going with the first thing that I had set my eye on, the Black Linguine (squid ink pasta with prawns). It wasn't the best version I've ever had, but overall a satisfying meal, and the prawns were very fresh. My husband ordered the Tagliata (sliced strip steak with herbed potatoes) - the $42 price tag almost was a deal-breaker, but we decided to splurge and let me just say... it was a HUGE meal. Honestly, it was at least double the size of what I would generally expect for a steak dinner - and it was absolutely delicious too.

The service was exceptional - prompt drink refills throughout the night, and they instantly brought us a brand new bread basket once we worked our way through the first (what can I say, we were hungry...). To be fair, it was about 9 PM at night, so it was pretty quiet in there, but I still always appreciate awesome service.

The location was also super convenient for anyone staying in the Financial District - we were staying at the Moxy Downtown, and this place was literally right across the street. So, it was the perfect option for us on a night where we weren't wanting to venture far, but still wanted to feel like we were going out.

All things considered, this place is a nice little Italian restaurant worth visiting.

We walked across the Brooklyn Bridge and searched for a place nearby.  We couldn't have been happier with Da Claudio.  Delicious Italian food, outdoor seating, attentive server.  Give this place your business; it's great.  Also, one person in our party had an egg allergy, and they were very nice/accommodating/understanding about it.

Surprisingly good. Didn't expect it coming from the business smart decor in the heart of the FiDi.

Staff was very friendly and made me feel welcomed.

Octopus was beautifully presented. Flavors were well balanced and the Olive Tapenade complimented the dish excellently.

Gnocchi was served with perfect Al Dente texture, and the Pesto was as homemade fresh as it comes.

This place responds so well to patrons' requests. They are serving their takeout in the eco containers  - very important if you are accustomed to take out. The food is delicious. Fried oyster panini is my personal fave. Good job! Will recommend to anybody.

We found this great place after doing a search for an Italian restaurant that took large groups. We loved every part of our experience there. First of all, the ambiance was very nice. Low, decent lighting, and despite being full the noise level was great. Our party was able to have a normal conversation.

The host was very friendly and professional, making sure we were always taken care of. The staff were fast, attentive, offered great suggestions and we never felt rushed. They had very creative cocktails I'd never heard of and the food was delicious, all fresh and decent sized portions. We had the Caesar salad, grilles vegetables and potatoes, lasagna and a mixed seafood dish. This was a nice surprise and all agreed we'd be returning.

I am so glad they are open!   I work nearby and have been going here for years.   Everyone I work with loves it here.   I got takeout for the first time and it did not dissapoint.   Additionally the customer service and attention to detail was amazing.   You must try the artichoke appetizer with breadcrumbs and every pasta dish is amazing.  The salads are also great for lunch.   Please support this wonderful local business!!!

I totally agree with the other 3 star review, service was really bad for us.  Not only did we feel ignored while other tables were tended to I feel like our girl gave me complete attitude on multiple occasions.  At one point she said she would be right back after she opened some wine for a table, okay...then she continued after that to take orders for two other tables.  When I had to flag her down again after that she gave me complete attitude.  WHY?  Just apologize and we can move on....We litterally then placed our order and I asked for a glass of wine the next time she came around...she then had the nerve to ask me with full on attitude, "so do you want it like now, just really just when I come around again?"  Mouth dropped at that comment.  Sadly this made everything terrible as the food was tasty but bad service just ruins everything for me.

Dependable new Italian restaurant that opened up near Fulton Street. Ambiance and prices are perfect for FiDi company lunches where meals generally are around $30, but not the Italian restaurant of choice for dinner dates when the area is dead and the food doesn't justify the trek.

Came here twice for a company lunch. First time, we ordered the Prosciutto di parma with fresh fruit as an appetizer for the table. The prosciutto tasted good and was perfect for sharing even for a group of 5. I ordered the steak on a bed of puréed polenta as my entree, which must have been a special since it isn't on the regular menu. Despite being a tiny bit overcooked, my medium steak was soft and paired well with the purée and watercress on top.

Second time around, I opted for the prix fix lunch for $25, which comes with a soup or salad, a pasta entrèe (unfortunately not all pasta dishes are included in this deal), and your choice of latte, cappuccino, americano or tea. Not that I had many choices to select from but I was glad to have ordered the Insalata di Rucola as my appetizer. The Caesar salad that someone else on our table ordered looked so plain that I couldn't believe how romaine lettuce with a couple of croutons and some sprinkled Parmesan cheese could cost $15 outside of the prix fix menu. Forget dreaming - there's no chicken in that salad. Insalata di Rucola, however, also consisted of simple ingredients but the dressing was everything. That lemon dressing was so light and refreshing at the same time; I couldn't stop eating it. It totally made the prix fix meal worth it for me.

After hearing that the Carbonara last time was a little dry from coworkers, I opted for the Garganelli with wagyu bolognese. The pasta was very al dente and sauce was standard affair, but it felt like something was missing there. I simply didn't feel excited to finish it. I did finish it but was left craving something else. My coworker ordered the Calamarata, which had all different types of seafood and large thick cut pasta, but it was too salty for my taste.

Unfortunately, our party opted not to get dessert...both times we were there (sad face). We just had our lattes and called it a day. However they have all the standard Italian desserts on the menu for those with a sweet tooth.

Came here after work party for drinks.

Italians from out of town were seated prior to my group (place must be legit).

Wine was flowing.

The octopus dish was alright, I feel like there was too much of a bitter taste (was it artichoke?).

The mixed calamari and the carbonara were on point.

They make a serviceable Maker's old fashioned.

Awesome little Italian spot in lower Manhattan. Service and food was great! They do have a happy hour menu in the bar from 4- 6 PM with drink and appetizer specials. My friend and I both started with the arugula salad which was delicious and very fresh. I had the cacio e pepe for dinner and it was excellent. The portion was HUGE and could absolutely be shared. I will be back!

Came here with my dad and partner before a church service at St. Paul's. Had the fried artichoke appetizer, wagyu bolognese and chocolate mousse tart. Service here was really excellent and the owner Claudio was super cordial. The fried artichoke hearts were really good and so was the bolognese.  This place is definitely a nice find if you're in the financial district. Only complaint is that some of the hazelnut ice cream had ice crystals in it like it had melted and then ben re-frozen.  But they did have a wonderful bottle of Nero D'avola Sicilian red wine.
