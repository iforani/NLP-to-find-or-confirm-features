A little piece of Amalfi, Italy, I am told by the company I'm with, who've been to Italy few times. In other words, this is the real thing, not the Americanized version.
Our only mistake is that we came for drinks and desserts after having dinner in another place.
We had Aperol  Spritz- about 2 each. The best drink for a hot summer night post COVID, outdoor dining.  We had two gelatos, hazelnut and pistachio. WOW. The hazelnut was like eating frozen nutella and the pistachio was absolutely amazing, delicate, flavorful, creamy yet not heavy. Delicious. My dessert was on the savory side... yes, just didn't feel like something sweet. I had an appetizer that I never heard of nor tasted before: Shaved artichoke hearts with shaved parmigiano and olive oil. That was an amazing surprise in every bite. It was crisp,  lightly salted, and you could taste the quality of the EVOO, but it wasn't greasy,  and the parmigiano of the highest quality.  A day later, as I am writing this review, I still have the delicate, superb taste in my mouth, making it watery again... :) This one came with bread and olives in olive oil to the table... the best quality of olives and olive oil... again!
Service was amazing. Attentive and friendly and so welcoming and relaxing. Some places these days, make you feel you should rush so that more business could come in. Not here. Taking your time, the Italian way.
As I said initially, our only mistake was that we didn't have dinner here (and not because our diner wasn't good). So we definitely will come again.
P.S. Because of COVID, they sanitize the restroom between users. That was impressive to me, as I didn't expect that, as the lady informed me I'll have to wait for her to sanitize before I go in. So... extra point for cleanliness!

We came here for Valentine's Day- our first time going out for the holiday (we usually cook) so we were excited for the celebration of it all. That being said I give this place and experience three stars- okay, fine even but not good or great.

Our reservation was at 9:30 pm and after arriving a few minutes before, we were surprised to see 4-5 other couples crammed into the tiny front entry still waiting for their reserved tables as well. A few more came in after us as well and we ended up not being seated until 10 pm. To be fair, there was a table available by the bar five minutes before we ended up sitting but at this point of waiting, we thought what's a few more minutes for a nicer table by the window. That bar table actually ended up leaving because the server never came to their table. So not a good start.

Once we were sat at the nice table by the window, we also had to wait about ten or so minutes for water and a server. We placed our orders from the pri fixe menu right away because at this point we were very hungry. Annoyingly, the meal was poorly timed by the restaurant. Our appetizers came out at the same time as the starter bread basket and olives, then the wait between these and the meal was about 30 minutes.

For appetizers, I ordered the quail and Beebs ordered the polenta. I've never had quail before and it was nice to try something new. Both were good dishes. For main course, he had the steak and I had the lobster linguine. Both dishes came out on cold plates which if you know anything about food, is a recipe for disaster if you're having a hot meal. Also the mashed potatoes they came with his steak or lukewarm. My pasta was definitely forgettable. The lobster and the linguine were both under season and lacking flavor.

When we finally got desert (which was also another long wait), this was probably the redeeming part of the meal. I got the pine nut tart and he got the tiramisu. The tiramisu was fine- definitely not the best I've ever had but my pine nut tart was delicious. It was crunchy and sweet from honey. A much needed plus after a forgettable meal.

Well this is all happening, we had the server come over one time in the entire meal to check if everything was OK. The staff was friendly when they were attentive but they were barely attentive so it's not saying much. So definitely not worth the hassle if there is a hassle to come to this place. There's plenty of other good Italian spots you can go to for a much more memorable meal.

This is a "mom and pop" Italian restaurant with extensive wine selections. It had rustic charm, beautiful that lovely. Such a warm, romantic space for a perfect date! It is a rather small space, but they do have another room downstairs, which can be used for a private event.

We had a few appetizers to share; Burrata con Pomodoro e Basilico, and Ravioli di Mele. Burrata dish was fresh and tasty, refreshing on a hot, steamy day. Ravioli had a nice sweetness to it, packed with flavor!

We also had their infamous Carciofo alla Romana, which is a Braised Artichoke. It was unique and impressive. The heart was almost creamy, melt in your mouth.

They had a few special of the day, and one of them was lasagna. We didn't order it, but we got a small sample, and it was soooooo good!

For main, I chose Spigola al Forno, a 'Whole' Mediterranean Sea Bass It came out beautiful! One of the owners, Michelle, filleted it for me right there. The first bite of the fish gave me such joy...it was absolutely delicious! We enjoyed this dish very much!

My hubby went with Agnello in Crosta di Pistacchio, a Sicilian Pistachio Crusted Roasted Rack of Lamb. It had a great crunchy exterior with plump and juicy inside. Packed with flavor, tender and very satisfying.

We ended with Tiramisù and Torta di Cioccolato. It was one of the best Tiramisù and flourless chocolate cake I've ever had!

We had an amazing dinner here, I am so happy to have discovered this restaurant! Everything we had was superb, we enjoyed them all from the first bite to the last. Our main server, Valentine, took a great care of us. If you want to have some authentic, delicious food with family and friends, or have a very romantic date, this might be the perfect spot for you!

I usually order in from them but decided to take advantage of a beautiful Wednesday night to enjoy outdoor dining. They have done a marvelous job with the outdoor set up making it both safe and inviting. The food is even better straight out of the kitchen!!!! Burrata was creamy and who knows how they got such good tomatoes this late in the season, the duck raviolis were the perfect combination of savory with a touch of sweet and then came the tiramisu ..... why haven't I ever ordered this before. Note to self - always save room for desert here. A great dinner out overall and a great spot on 5th!

This restaurant WAS amazing at one point in time. What's happened recently to this place is beyond me but my experience last week was the worst experience I've ever had at any restaurant especially one that I frequented on a regular basis. I called earlier in the week explaining that it was my fiancées 50th Birthday and that he's been dreaming of their lamb. I wanted to take him out for a special night and wanted to make a reservation. I was told "No Reservations" but that we'd be taken care of. So confidently I went last Saturday only to be greeted by their rude and nasty hostess. She insisted that we sit at the one and only table that was literally in the street completely separate from the outdoor seating (mind you there were 4 empty tables despite the 2 guys sitting in a table for 4). She looked at my fiancée up and down and gave him a dirty look while I was speaking to her - MY fiancée is African American -  she didn't even look at me as I spoke! I asked the woman nicely if she could sit us inside the seating area and she said 'No, that's for reservations'. I told her nicely that I was confused because I called earlier in the week and tried to make reservations and was told that they didn't make reservations. She stuttered and said well those tables are for parties of 4. I pointed to the 2 gentlemen sitting at the table for 4. I asked 'then why are those guys and that couple sitting at the tables for 4?  She gave me the BS that the guys were "Regulars".  Again I asked 'So I have to be a regular to get a table?! That doesn't make sense. I called earlier this week to make sure I didn't have to go through all this back and forth. It's my fiancé's birthday and all I want is for him to have a special dinner."  My fiancé whispered to me 'Let's just go somewhere else Babe.' She then said rudely "Fine! Sit where you want!" I was SO TAKEN A BACK! But sat down because I really didn't want to mess up my fiancées night or cause a scene. The hostess glared at us all night and made me so uncomfortable that I regretted ever going there. The famous lamb he wanted  - HORRIBLE!!! No day or flavor. We ordered the shrimp appetizer - No flavor or salt. I had the broiled fish and also no salt or flavor just a fish sitting in 2 inches of olive oil. I wasted $150 for the worst dinner and experience I've ever had. If it wasn't for my fiancée I would've just picked up and left. NEVER AGAIN!!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY HERE -

I wrongfully assumed that I could stroll into any Italian restaurant and find vegetarian options,  never on the Secondi section but definitely under Primi...such was not the case here.  The only vegetarian entree on the menu is the spiach gnudi which was very good if you're into spinach as the flavors definitely stands out above the asiago sauce and cheese.

Service was average, they were not willing to make any modifications to accommodate, I really wanted to try the ravioli and was hoping they could omit the duck ragu but I was told that wasn't possible.  When we ordered wine they only brought over one of two glasses and when we asked for the check we were told the dessert menu haha.

The ambiance was quiet, super cute for a date night and I'm pretty sure we were seated next to a couple on their first date which speaks to the vibe.  It's a dark, romantic, and cozy establishment.  Which I didn't mind at all.  If they update the menu I would definitely come back and likely give it more stars :)

So this review will be off of lack of communication or intrest of the hostess.  Who cared nothing for the overflowing of people in the doorway of the restaurant making it a hazard for servers to move around and guest to get in n out of their seats.
A 9pm reservation was greeted with a "give me one moment, to they will be done with dessert  soon " to her disappearing after the influx of people came into the door with the same time frame for reservations. Now there is a huge wait and no answer on when we will sit.
In reviewing the food there wasnt a ability too I have heard good things about this place and date night got turned into pizza night. Suck!!

Better handling of reservations and better communication so you dont have a safety issue on your hands at your front door. A phone call would have be a quick way of giving people a heads up of delays.

Hopeful to try the food let see what happens... to be continued

I'm so happy to have finally come to this restaurant! The food all around was absolutely delicious. We started off with the burrata, always great. We then shared the Tagliatelle and Agnello (rack of lamb). The tagliatelle was simply delicious. The ragu was perfectly seasoned. The Agnello was a very nice surprise flavorwise. I think the pistachio crust created a nice texture with the lamb. We ended our meal with the tiramisu and ginseng espresso. The tiramisu was so good. Absolutely perfect. The ginseng espresso really blew my mind. I'd never had ginseng espresso and I'm glad I decided to try it out! highly recommend. I'll definitely be coming back!

A hidden gem for sure. I must have passed this place a hundred times, but it looks more like a Brooklyn antique shop than a restaurant from the outside. Came here for my girlfriends birthday dinner and everything from start to finish was incredible. The inside is very cute and cozy. Our waiter was incredibly helpful and helped us pick not only a bottle of wine but food as well, and he couldn't have done a better job. Wine was delicious, and the food was incredible. Can't wait to go back.

My boyfriend and I had a date night here last weekend, and I was so glad we picked this spot for dinner. When we got there it was (understandably) very busy, so we had to wait, but the hostess got us drinks while we sat. I had a spinach salad and a ragu pasta dish, and both were incredible. I had the tiramisu for dessert, and while some tiramisus I have had just aren't worth it, this one was delicious. I have always really cared about the atmosphere of a restaurant, and although the beautiful interior was closed for dining, the outdoor seating was very pretty and pleasant. Will definitely be going back!

Every dish we had here was nearly perfect. Oozing deliciousness. The food was not-quite-familiar, seemingly influenced by many countries around the mediterranean, maybe with Italy dominating. It all felt like nostalgic home cooking--but from an alternate reality in which you grew up in Italy, Spain, and Portugal, and your mom was a brilliant chef.

It's also just about the nicest space I've seen for a Brooklyn storefront restaurant. The dining area downstairs is especially inviting, with glowing light, a cool breeze, and the comfort of being surrounded by floor-to-ceiling wine on all sides.

Wonderful owner who was a pleasure to speak to. The food and wine selections are superb. We had a 6:30 dinner reservation for six. Was seated at about 6:45 due to a couple finishing up. Once seated, menus, apps, wine and entrees flowed seamlessly. It was great.

What a beautiful and cozy place.
It's feels like you are truly back in Italy.
Everything is amazing, every single salad on the menu is amazing, every appetizer is amazing, every hot dish is amazing. You don't have to think too long, just take one of each and you will absolutely enjoy every bite of it.
And when you will come again order other dishes and you enjoy even more then first time.
No wonder this place was featured in New York magazine as one of the most popular places in Park Slope for past two decades.
PS You must try their Braised artichokes and Octopus salad, but ask for less onion...lol

I hate writing bad reviews, but the way the manager/owner treated us was ludicrous.
When i walked in, the first thing he said (older Italian guy smelling repulsively like cigarettes and not knowing what personal space is) was to ask me how I spelled my name after he clearly had it written in from of him on my reservation. Didn't really pay much attention as it happens often. The only table they had was upstairs where there were several crying babies, so I asked if they had a table downstairs, he said no and proceeded to convince me the table he is giving me was the best in the restaurant. I said can you give us a minute to decide and we sat down. 3 mins later he comes and I told him we decided to stay and his response was 'well, don't feel like you are doing me a favor staying. If you don't like it you can leave  I feel like if you aren't 100% happy with the table maybe this is not a good fit for you and you can find another place'
What a salty man, If I were with guy friends I was gonna tell him exactly how I felt and the way he spoke to me was unacceptable. But I composed my self and told him, thank you for your hospitality, hope you treat others better.
The food could be good, but if someone gets in your face and is being rude with you in front of a lady, a bad review is the least he deserves.

We are so glad we picked this place for our anniversary. Family owned and run, and you can tell everyone truly cares about your experience.

*Bread and olive oil was yummy
*Grilled octopus - delicious
*Apple & cinnamon ravioli with duck ragu - exceptional
*Sardinian Pasta with Housemade Berkshire Pork Sausage in Tomato Sauce - very yummy, great flavor
*Blueberry & coconut crumble pie - perfect dessert, light but delicious

The decor is rustic and warm. Fairly small so be sure to make a reservation.

This place has been on my list to visit for ages and was really looking forward to it after seeing the high ratings it gets.

Unfortunately we were left disappointed. The place could be great but too many things fell short of expectations on the night we visited.

We asked for the dessert menu before ordering as that always helps me decide what to have for other courses, as soon as I was told there was panna cotta on offer, I was sold - my favorite

We ordered the chicken livers to share as a starter and the lamb chops and gnocchi gratinati al forno for mains.

The chicken livers are complimented by lovely flavors that I have not tried with them before - balsamic reduction, onion and pancetta. However the overcooked and dry livers made the dish less enjoyable than it could be.

We waited over 30 minutes between our starter being finished and the main coming out despite the fact that we ordered all at the same time. This was annoying as the restaurant was quite empty and people who came in and ordered after us had already received their food.

When the mains came, the cauliflower accompanying the lamb was cold and the gnocchi was bubbling hot, way too hot to eat. The lamb was perfection, probably the best lamb I have had but cold cauliflower took away from overall enjoyment! The gnocchi when it eventually cooled down was delicious as well.

For dessert we had the tiramisu and panna cotta. The tiramisu was very good. The biggest disappointment of the night was the wobble free over set panna cotta, why why why??? The flavors were good but the consistency was off and another dish fell short.

With desert I had a coffee, some instinct said open the milk jar.. and there were green bits floating in the milk, once pointed out it was replaced.

I doubt we will be back, too much better on offer in the area to risk another okish experience here

I have gone to Italy and ate such delicious Italian food and was never able to find that in New York- until I came to this place. My boyfriend brought me here for our anniversary and the food blew my mind. I got the Gnudi and it was absolutely delicious. We also had the artichoke appetizer- which was really good and melted in your mouth. Our server was so wonderful too. All in all- I highly suggest this place! Especially for a nice romantic date

Excellent Italian food, intimate and interesting interior, and good service. I had the duck ragu with apple cinnamon ravioli and it might have been one of the most memorable dishes and flavors I've ever had. I do recommend making a reservation because the main dining area is small; we went on a weeknight with a reservation and the place was full the whole time we were there.

I must have some really great friends because they brought me here for my birthday after I insisted I didn't need a celebration. Little did I know I would have a piping hot Italian meal and a piece of to-die-for flourless chocolate cake to end my 23rd year. Lucky me.

Convivium is rated as one of the best restaurants in Park Slope, which I cannot disagree with. Situated in the heart of 5th Ave, CO stands out among the rest. With copper pots and pots hung on the walls and rustic decor and brick throughout, you'll feel like you're getting the real Italian experience here.

For appetizers, we had the burrata and the meat/cheese plate (tagliere di salumi e formaggi). They were both very fresh and delicious, though I did think the serving sizes were small.

We all ordered pastas (primi) for dinner. How could you not? The gnudi di ricotta e spinici was a plate of 15 or so gnudis, a fluffly, light as a feather puff of pasta. Wow. The ricotta was thinned to a sauce, almost resembling a bechamel.

The sausage pasta (malloreddus con salsiccia) was second on my taste test, and I have to say it was also delicious. The sweet sausage was a surprising twist among the pecorino cheese. I still rated mine higher, but yum.

Last but not least was the tagliatelle al ragú, a fancy way of saying spaghetti with meat sauce. This was 3rd on my rankings, but still okay. I wasn't disappointed, but the flavor in the sausage pasta was more complimentary and went done easier.

Overall the staff was wonderful and took very good care of us. We had several bottles of wine among the 5 of us and we never had an empty glass. We were all quiet after being served, which my father always said is the best sign of a good meal.

Mangia!

I actually loved this place when I went. I wasn't expecting much since I was on a date but the venue really got me. It's actually close enough that you can visit before or after an event at the Barclays.

The decor of wood, old lights, and copper gives this place a warm vibe. If you want something a little more private, they have private room downstairs.

It's a good option for casual or formal occasions.

Disappointed to say the least. I could not begin to review the food because in the cadance of Saturday night dinner that was one part we had not reached before I decided to write this review.
Step 1 in the cadance..review,and research to determine reservation choice.
Step 2 make reservations
Step 3 Travel
Step 4 arrive and converse with hostess.
Then come the wait . The overcrowded wait for the table that was never received.
When recieved by the hostess she appeared to be underwhelemed by her overwhelming situation. They where clearly overbooked and clearly unable to manage.  The hostess espressed little attention to any concern of the mounting wait for a table. After being smooshed into the restuarant and ignored for over 10 minutes I had sadly decided to leave.
Hospitality was greatly lacking and the owner, manager, hostess whomever she was is i great need of revisiting the training for her position.

This review is for a dinner last week in the private dining room downstairs here.  I have done private dinners on a regular basis for work and I would say that Convivium stands out as an excellent experience.

Too often the danger of the private room is that you are out of sight and out of mind.  Here I didn't feel that we were forgotten at all.  Once our guests arrived, our server announced the courses and the entree choices.  Before our program started, she took everyone's order and everything flowed smoothly from there.  There was a nice variety of appetizers and everyone seemed to enjoy their entrees.  There was a point when we were ready for the entrees to show up and once we asked and they were on the table within a few minutes.

Private rooms often look like boring conference rooms, but having dinner in the downstairs room here is like eating in a wine cellar.  Strike that, you are actually eating in a wine cellar.  The owners obviously pride themselves on providing an authentic Italian dining experience and when you eat in this room, you can imagine being in a tasting room of a winery or villa in Italy.  All of our attendees were thrilled with the dinner and stayed well after the program was done, an indication of much they enjoyed their experience.

Our appetizers were served family style and included the baby kale salad with endive and cherry tomatoes; polenta with oyster mushrooms and taleggio cheese; grilled octopus; and a plate of smoked meats, cheese, and marcona almonds.  The servings were quite generous for the table, but folks had no problem clearing their plates.

Our entrees included red snapper prepared perfectly; gnudi with ricotta and spinach; rack of lamb; and Cornish hens.  Most of the people at the table ordered the fish, but everyone raved about their main dish.

For dessert, we got to try four different desserts. The flourless chocolate cake was divine and the apple tart was exceptional. Likewise the panna cotta was perfect and the berry tart was delicious.  Together it was a fantastic ending for a wonderful meal.  Thank you!!

When I was looking to set up this dinner, I had a hard time finding a spot in Park Slope that could accommodate a large group and would be a draw for potential attendees.  Convivium met the bill on both counts and was very responsive in setting up the event.  If you are looking for great spot with outstanding service for a private event, I can recommend Osteria without hesitation.

Like stepping off of 5th Ave. in Brooklyn and straight into Italy.

I'm not sure how I will be able to handle having two new favorite places in one month, but I will try to persevere.  Side note: this place is a few blocks from my apartment, so I've passed it on the street for the past four months, but never went inside.  I regret it now, but plan to make up for it.

The first thing you notice when you step inside is the decor.  It's very authentic Italian and cozy.  We were greeted by an Italian woman and seated on time for our reservation.  We were offered the wine menu while waiting for our table at the bar, which was subsequently brought to our table when we were seated.  We ordered a bottle barbera, which was delicious.

For the first course, we had the burrata.  It was not the best burrata I've ever had, but still very good.  For the main course, I ordered the Green apple, ricotta, and cinnamon housemade ravioli with Peking duck ragú. Yes, it's as good as it sounds. My friend ordered the housemade tagliatelle with beef and veal rosemary ragú, which was also insanely good.  I really love that all the pasta we ordered was made in-house.  It definitely took the flavor up a notch.

I noticed a lot of negative comments about the service, but I have to say, the service we experienced was pretty good.  The staff was attentive and I loved that the server was Italian.  The owner (also Italian) attended to our table as well.  The food was timed perfectly and we were never waiting for anything.

I will be back here as much as possible.

This place was very interesting! The environment is eye-catching and the restaurant is cozy! This place was recommended to me while I visiting here in the Brooklyn, And I always like to give at least one place that's recommended to me a try before I go and explore other places I've read
The vibe is pretty cool here the music is loud and in Italian. I came with my dad to eat here after a rough day in the hospital visiting my grandma so maybe it wasn't the best setting that we were looking to be in but that's not the restaurants fault.
But as a date or going out with friends this place would be perfect, especially if you don't mind the loud music.

The prices are fine, the lasagna was tasty,
My dad really enjoyed his lamb chops and we both thoroughly enjoyed of the Burrata. The polenta wasn't our favorite item.

All in all pleasant and interesting experience!

So disappointing.  We've been here twice before for parties and decided to host a family birthday party here.  Lovely interaction while making a reservation.  We were seated next to the door and were so cold with people opening the door coming in and out.  But with the food.  For apps, we had the tomato and mozzarella, octopus and a few salads.  Nothing was spectacular.  For the mains, the ribeye, the duck ravioli, the tagliatelle, and gnocchi.  The gnocchi was gross - very mushy, all else was decent.  Nothing was outstanding.  The dessert was the best part - had one of all and it was delicious.

So for this caliber of a restaurant (and equivalent price tag), we were disappointed. Don't know whether they were having an off-day, but we did not enjoy our dinner.

When I lived in the neighborhood 20 years ago and this place opened, it seemed unattainable- I was perpetually broke and this seemed both fancy and pricey. Now, in middle age, I realize that while it is more expensive than some offerings, these were missed opportunities to enjoy exceptionally good food, well prepared in an environment that transports you instantly to an Italian restaurant in the mountains of Puglia or a valley in Tuscany.

The dishes are simple and the wine is profound. They serve a spinach and ricotta gnudi that melts in your mouth, and a carciofi alla Romana that reminds me of trying that dish in Rome the first time. The upstairs space is small, but there's both a back garden and a large room in the cellar, surrounded by their excellent wines. Everything from beginning to the last bite of homemade, light as air tiramisu is delicious. Go and enjoy.

Whilst searching for a new dinner spot in downtown Brooklyn, Convivium caught my eye. With old school tavern-ish interior decor, the cozy little Italian restaurant seemed like a perfect pick for the night. I had reservations for a party of 2 at 8:30pm on a Thursday and was seated right away. The place filled up pretty fast afterwards. The waiter told us the special of the day and there is also a wine special on the board. They served bread with a small bowl of delicious olives in olive oil. I started off with the grilled octopus and a glass of Chianti red. The octopus was amazing although one or two more pieces would've been great. Convivium certainly has a great wine selection available. For the main course I had the whole roasted Mediterranean Sea bass with Swiss chard. The fish size was good and the fish itself was tasty. There were more little bones in the fish than I had anticipated. Overall great Italian spot that brings you back to the roots of Italy.

This is our second time in this restaurant. It's a very warm, cozy restaurant with a great wine list and an even better food menu. I strongly recommend the seared scallops to start , the ravioli of the season with apple fillings is amazing and the rack of lamb - simply awesome. Even though we didn't have an reservation for a Friday night, we were really pleased to know that waiting time was like 30mins so we could get a drink first at the bar before dinner. Service was really attentive all around and was delighted with such a wonderful dining experience. It's a pity they don't do lunch anymore but I hear brunch may be in the offing soon!

You can make a reservation for up to 8 people on Opentable. It is a large space with a big basement for seating. They can accommodate large groups but don't have high chairs for children. We tried the liver, lamb chop, gnudi, octopus and several of the pastas. All of the food was pretty good with my favorite being the octopus.

My fiancée and I celebrated our engagement at Convivium. I originally had my doubts on this restaurant based on another review. After reaching out to the restaurant on their website, the owners contacted me and we later spoke on the phone to clear things up. I appreciate that kind of response and am happy that we celebrated here.

We made reservations online and our table was ready when we arrived. The ambiance is very comforting and the staff is friendly. Inside the restaurant, you feel as though you are in an old European village. We started with an organic Montepulciano which was great across the board.

Appetizers: we started with the Octupus and the Braised Artichoke. We loved the octopus, though we would not order the artichoke on our future visits as it was a bit heavy on the oil.

Pastas: we ordered the Squid Ink Linguini and the Ravioli with Peking Duck Rago. Both were amazing. The ravioli and duck together created an amazing flavor.

Dessert: we finished our wine with a generous platter of cheeses which we recommend.

Overall experience: lovely

Would I recommend to friends? We've told at least 10 people about our amazing time at Convivium.

Can't wait to go back to try other dishes.

I've been coming here for years now and they never disappoint.  Atmosphere is warm and cozy. Lots of knic-nacks and they're never dusty. Seafood and game dishes are the winners here. Clams in the pot with chorizo my favorite . Kool neighborhood spot.

Here's the problem with Convivium Osteria: one of their dishes is so incredibly delicious - so craveworthy and perfect - so wonderful that every time we go we cannot help but order it.  Everything on the menu is so tempting - and I want to try it all - but even when I go with the intention of trying more things, I always default to the favorite.

It's the Porterhouse steak - for two.  To. Die. For.  We'll generally order one of the lighter appetizers to share as a starter (the steak comes with crispy rosemary roast potatoes and a perfectly dressed salad of delicate greens) - but the rest of the exceptional menu is neglected because of the incomparable steak.

We've managed to work around this "problem" by bringing friends with us to "double date", allowing us to "share family style" some of the delectable pastas and fresh seafood delights (whether they planned on it-or not).

Would you like to join us?

Just kidding!

The service is always warm and attentive - you feel like you're a guest in the home of a dear friend... until you get the check (which, by the way, is an amazing value for the quality of the entire experience)!

Seated in the wine cellar, sharing copious amounts of wine and excellent pasta over candlelight, my wife leaned in...and stole the last ravioli off my plate.

Well, the romance may be dead in our relationship, but you seem like you still have a shot. So take your date to Convivium, and order the green apple and cinnamon ravioli with duck ragú. I know it sounds a bit odd, and it's ever so slightly sweet for my taste, but it works. So just do it.

If I have one warning for you:

I wouldn't get too attached to any of your choices on the wine list. We were literally sitting in a cellar full of wine, and yet they were out of the first three bottles we chose. Eventually we just said, "Bring us the cheapest bottle of white wine that you actually have." Because we're classy.

If I have two warnings for you:

Watch my wife around your ravioli. She's a thief.

If there was a 4.5 Star available, Convivium Osteria would get it. I loved it but there was something off for my meal. I felt like most dishes were missing that "omg" factor. All ingredients were fresh, meat was cooked amazingly but there was something from keeping me from the full 5 stars.

Just had a nice meal at Convivium. Still same great atmosphere. Still same great rustic food. But now the prices felt more reasonable (I think because rest of Park slope is getting so pricy). And now they take credit cards (beyond Amex). Woohoo!

Still recommend this place for a nice romantic meal. The food is spot on.
We had giant prawns cooked in salt, seafood salad, green apple ravioli with duck ragu - each one was flavorful, refreshing and perfectly executed.

Will be back

What can one say about Convivium Osteria - it is love on the plate. Probably the best romantic restaurant in park slope. Between rustic dishes with decadent sauces and seasonings, huge red wine selection (and great wine advice from sommelier), great romatic decor (dark wood tones, wooden tables, candle-light, copper pans on the walls) and attentive service - this is a great place for a date or romantic dinner.

Food is top notch. Most dishes are decadent and filling, so be ready to share. My favorites are - prawns cooked in salt (very flavorful and reasonable serving size), quail in red wine (sweet, gamy and fun), rack of lamb (soft, flavorful and well seasoned), rabbit (gamy with great taste of olives, capers and mediterranean ), and green apple ravioli with duck ragu (just decadent and great flavor combo). The wife prefers seafood - whole dorado or sea bass I've tasted off her plate were very good, but I still say that this cuisine shines when it comes to meats more than fish.
For a lighter fare, octopus salad is great and lighter still is the fresh greens (spinach? not sure, not an expert on salads) salad with goat cheese and nuts. Pasta dishes are also lighter fare compared to meats.
Can't comment on deserts as I'm stuffed everytime after an app and a main dish, and that says a lot as I can eat big time.

Not cheap. Not for children. But great experience each time. Make reservations as they fill up quickly and bring cash or AMEX as they don't take normal credit cards.
