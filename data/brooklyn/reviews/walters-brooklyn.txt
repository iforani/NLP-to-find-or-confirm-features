Delicious local brunch spot.

Wait was a little long - popular so be patient!

We did takeaway and sat in the park across the road, enjoying the weather. Takeaway menu had solid options.

Food was quick and satisfying. Recommend!

Walter's is a gift from God. When normal life returns, I urge you to experience their ambience and STELLAR customer service, but in the meantime enjoy your Caviar delivery orders.

I ordered the burger and fries first, and everything was a dream. Their fries are magical in a way that really makes you understand what separates chefs from cooks. All of their food has been carefully thought out, and it shows. I assume they must have multiple steps to their fries, because the closest I've gotten to this is Minetta Tavern. The 2nd time I got this delivered the burger was still good but less magical. So I got the chicken next....

BAAAAYYYBEEEEE!!!! The spices they add to the honey for dipping your chicken in just... I mean it makes me want to cry tears of joy. ALSO they read the delivery notes, because I needed 2 in my life to properly experience my Nirvana. The chicken is super crispy and good too, but combined with the honey it's a MASTERPIECE! The mashed potatoes are decent too, it's just that beside the chicken there is no competition. Just save all of your calories for the chicken, because it's that good.

Anyway, Walter's has become my go-to spot during this pandemic. Their hours are reliable, they're super fast, and their quality is consistent. I can't tell you how much joy they've been bringing to me, and thankfully by limiting the bites of mashed potatoes I'm down 10 pounds even while stuck in the house eating well on weekends

Charly the manager was a true gem to making our experience at Walter's beyond great. The servers, Omar and Luis also was very attentive to serving our needs. The food was divine and what they all recommended, we ordered. Thank you for the relief during these covid times. It had been the only enjoyable dining out almost back to normal experience we had in the longest. Much needed. Thank you Charly, Omar, Luis and the rest of the team. Great job on management on Charly's part!

Brought my sister there for the first time and we left the place in a heavenly food daze like walking on clouds. We started off with the popular artichoke dip, lentil soup,  tuna salad, saigon sandwich, and finished off with their scrumptious key lime pie and flourless chocolate cake! All this was highly recommended by Riki + Charly whom are two of the very best servers I've had when eating at Walter's. Even the runner, Luis was specially attentive to filling up my teapot of hot water and our water jug.  Cutomer service's charming smiles  double the stars of the food! Sister and I left there very stuffed and satisfied! Will most likely bring friends there! ! :)

I absolutely loved the food that they serve there! One of the best burgers I have tried in a while.

Charlie was more than a gentleman! His services were impeccable and always on top of us by making sure we were pleased.

I highly recommend anyone who wants great food and have an amazing staff to help provide that!

We came on a quiet night just before the restaurants closed for dine in customers. The service was great, the drinks were delicious, and we ordered enough food to keep the kitchen a little busy.

My favorite thing to order here is the Bar Steak. It's a flank steak served with Chimichurri and horseradish sauce. Flank steaks are one of my favorite cuts, and I love the Chimichurri sauce with it. I'm a huge French Fry fan, and the fries served with this dish are the best eva.

This is a really great neighborhood restaurant in Fort Greene. I'm already dreaming of the steak...

Amazing service and food, but the mosquitoes took me out. I will likely do a drive by to get their special meatballs and the coconut pie again. Both delicious! But one note is less cheese on the meatballs perhaps. It seemed like too much for the dish and overwhelmed the flavor of the meat.

4/5 --Love the lunch vibes!

Sat at the bar 2 of us, cousin visiting from out of town. It's always a fun vibe here. The restaurant is generally always busy.

We had a bottle of rose and 2 extra glasses, side order of fries , shrimp cocktail and dried rub chicken wings.

The chicken wings were my favorite! Man is it tough to find good wings in the city. I still stand by Rochester and Buffalo having the best wings. The skid was crispy while the meat was moist and cooked all the way through. Loved their seasoning. Delicious! Can't wait to have that again!

Everything else was good too but can't really mess up shrimp cocktail. I guess you can fail on fries but their fries are delicious!

It was a nice afternoon to have a bottle, few drinks and snack. We'll have to go back for a full on meal!

This is in regards to their Walters To Go Takeout experience.

This evening we ordered two Walter Burgers to-go and let's just say I'll wait until they are opened for dine in. I feel bad for writing this review because I know small businesses are struggling, but I really couldn't eat this at all. This is my first to-go order and never have I had a burger this inedible.

First, we asked for medium rare, but we got rare burger patties that were still raw, pink and mushy. Second, the way it's packaged to-go is not ideal. The plastic container trapped all the heat and made the burger bun completely soggy from the condensation. I've had better luck with fast food burgers. I wished they would at least separately wrap the burger with paper, instead of packing it along with the fries.

Outside of take-out, their Walter burgers dining-in are fantastic. If you do decide to order take out, please keep the above in mind.

Came here at 6pm on a friday with a reservation. Bar was filled and only a couple of tables empty. Small cute place, which we wanted to try for a long time. We've been a couple of times to Karasu which is the speakeasy japanese bar in the back.

Walters like Karasu is kind of expensive but the food is excellent. And the food came out in 5 minutes of ordering it!  And happy hour house cocktail for 7 dollars was great. The one today was rye, simple syrup, bitters. Simple but so good. My boyfriend ordered the fried chicken and I tasted a bit. It had a great crunchy crust with lots of flavor and the chicken was moist and delicious. Best fried chicken I've had in a while. The honey sauce pairing is interesting, I think it has some Asian flair. There are chili flakes in it plus I think some orange because when I dipped the chicken in it, it reminded me of chinese orange chicken.

I got the French dip sandwich with both cheese and onions on it. It was a good sandwich, I wish it had a tad more meat and that the cheese and onions weren't a dollar each extra since usually that dish is served with them on it already. I subbed the garlic mashed potatoes for French fries and im glad I did. The mashed potatoes were so yummy, rich and creamy. And a good garlic flavor that wasn't too overpowering.

I definitely think the fried chicken dish is the best value. Large portion and delicious.

Also the wait staff were nice and polite but 4 times came by asking us to take our plate away when we clearly were not finished. And as soon as our credit card came back and we signed the receipt it was taken away. I didn't notice the same rush treatment for the family next to us. So it was odd.

While i loved the food and cocktail I knocked off a star for the higher prices and feeling rushed as we ate.

Was there last week for brunch. The chicken and waffles were as good as I remembered and decided to also have 3 oysters since I hadn't had any in a while. Everything was great! The staff are all wearing mask and the outside seating is spaced out sufficiently.

I am new to exploring the Fort Greene area and decided to try out Walters for a late dinner with two of my friends. Upon arrival we were seated right away and greeted by a very cheery waitress who proceeded to provide us with the special for the evening which was a burrata salad. Thank God we were immediately informed because this special was the highlight of the evening.

When it arrived it came with a lovely array of roasted vegetables and then we proceeded to ask for bread to dip with. The waitress provided us with a sourdough loaf as well as a baguette. Obviously the carbs were amazing and came with delicious olive oil.

For my entree, I ordered the fried chicken. I will say that I thought the breading on the fried chicken was a little thick but the chicken was cooked to perfection and the hot honey was a great complement. Overall I think I'd like to come back and experience their happy hour and brunch!

Came here for a drink with a friend (without reservations). Turned out you definitely need a rezzie for the back room speakeasy on a Saturday night. Luckily we were able to grab a seat at the main bar at the front of the restaurant. Cocktails were decent. Great ambiance.
I'd return to try the food.

In 2012 I went to Walters on a first date with someone I met on OKCupid. I had never had raw oysters, and he was determined show me how good they were. I fell in love with the oysters, and a few month later realized I had fallen in love with the man who showed them to me. 8 years, a few thousand miles, and many many oysters later, me and that someone are happily married, living on the opposite coast with our small dog and 10 billion house plants. So thank you Walters for the amazing oysters! If I hadn't liked them, who knows where I'd be?

Walter's is a small but comfortable place,  four of us stopped in for breakfast one Sunday AM.  We were lucky enough to be seated quickly.
Service was good, our coffees came out quickly, and our food followed quickly as well.
All four of us opted for omelets.  Portions were good, pricing was what you would expect in NYC.  The food was good, not necessarily great. Nothing really special about it, but it did the trick.
I'd go back to Walter's again while in the area, mainly because of the good service.

Drinks are fine, but don't order the empanadas with your drinks. They're pinky size and cost $6. And it's only 2 per order.

Offering brunch oysters is almost bribery. Little Shems & Wellfleets made my freezing cold morning that much happier. Oysters come with cocktail sauce and two mignonettes, all of them are low key, the oysters shine.

I ordered black tea and an omelette with andouille and pepperjack, it comes with a hash brown and lightly dressed greens. The hash brown was delicious, crispy on the outside and softer on the inside. They also serve their omelettes French style, meaning the fold of the egg is thinner, much more delicate, and there is no browning. I think this is the superior way to serve omelettes :)

I will say the seats by the door do get cold in the winter. They have two doors and a thick curtain, really there's only so much you can do when it gets as cold as was the day I came. Luckily they have hooks for all your winter spread both at the bar and along some of the walls.

The painted white tin ceiling and beautiful floors give the impression that the space has been here awhile and is being well cared for. Great atmosphere, friendly, attentive service even when it was busy!

I've never met Walter, but I have to assume he's a great man. In fact, I'd vote for Walter for president (he might be the only one not running right now).

You heard it here first. I'm throwing my support behind the Walter/Fried Chicken ticket for 2020.

Politics aside, this is the restaurant that I would aspire to, if I were ever to own a restaurant. They offer American staples that are well-executed and flavorful; the food is beautiful because they are hearty portions that are unpretentiously delicious, not because they were plated with tweezers.

It is both classic and classy, and still casual enough to be a good choice for any occasion. Walter's is the ideal place for a lazy brunch, an oysters/cocktails/deviled eggs date, a celebratory dinner, a weekday lunch with someone else who is blowing off work, and just about anything else I can think of.

The menu has enough on it that everyone can find something they are excited about, but limited enough that I'd eat anything on it, and I haven't had anything bad through quite a few visits.

The burger is nearly a half pound (none of this thin patty nonsense going around - although I like those too), cooked correctly, with all the things I want on a burger. They pickle their onions because it tastes good, and because they know I want onion on my burger but I still want to have friends after dinner.

The fries are perfect. I don't say that lightly.

The fried chicken comes with hot honey, as it should, and it satisfies every craving you've got. If I'm feeling healthy, there's always a tasty fish on the menu (steelhead trout, black bass, etc.) and vegetables if I'm in a cruelty-free mood. Pasta, if I need some gluten in my life. All of this is properly cooked.

The cocktails are excellent (including the bloody at brunch), the hash browns are why you go out for food you can't cook at home in good conscience, and the egg dishes are done right.

It's not amazing for kids, but it's not so bad either (the tables are tight, so leave your stroller at home though). The staff is lovely in general, and was so sweet and helpful with any of our baby needs...if that's just because my kid is the most adorable child in Brooklyn, that's your problem, not mine.

This is the neighborhood restaurant I wish was a little bit more in my neighborhood, but I don't mind walking a little bit farther for.

Although I've been remiss in checking it out for dinner, Walter's is just about everything I'm looking for in a brunch spot. It's got:

1. A very decent Bloody Mary.
2. A surprisingly affordable and unfailingly delicious Breakfast Sandwich.
3. An excellent burger.
4. Great service, good music (can never have enough Mobb Deep in my life), and a sunny, comfortable dining room.

I apologize for the overly simplistic review, but simplicity is one of the things I like most about Walter's.

What a gem in Fort Greene! We made same-night reservations on Resy on a weekend, which was probably just luck in our favor. Based on the crowd on a Sunday night (of a holiday weekend), my guess is that you'll want to make a reservation a few days in advance if looking for a peak time.

As for the food, whoa. We started with the grilled octopus topped with chimichurri - perfectly executed. It comes with potatoes so it's an appropriately filling app. My husband raved about the french dip sandwich and said it was in the top 3 he's ever had. He literally ate everything, even the fries, without sharing :( I ordered the spicy fishermen's stew and was thoroughly impressed. They didn't skimp on the seafood - huge shrimp, mussels, clams, and crabmeat - or the spice. If there's anything I'd nitpick, I found the tomato "broth" to bit a bit thick and saucy, but it is a "stew" and not a bouillabaisse. We also ordered key lime pie for dessert and loved it. Having lived in Florida for a few years, we know a good, authentic key lime pie when we have it. This was as close as it gets in NY during winter. It was around $100 not including tip for us- we didn't get booze but FYI they do charge for soda refills.

Brunch restaurant in front of Fort Greene Park. The wait on a Saturday around 1:30 was real 20/30 mins. Me and my friend were seated right then and served by a really polite and smily server.
As soon as you are seated you are served with complimentary small muffins. A really lovely touch.
The place is small and cozy, and at the same time elegant. We had a two of their brunch specials and they were both delicious. I enjoyed very much my omelette with a side of salad and hash brown, while my friend had their burger with a mount of crispy and thin French fries.

I came in on a Saturday in September and sat at the bar, where there was an absolutely terrible smell of garbage for the duration of my meal. It smelled like they hadn't cleaned the restaurant in weeks.

The chicken and waffles was dry and unremarkable, served bone-in despite nothing on the menu stating as much. There were also no free refills on soda, which is a sign of a greedy owner desperate for margins.

I came here with my friend on a Saturday afternoon for brunch, and it was packed! This place is super popular, which makes sense since it's right across the street from Fort Greene Park BUT ALSO because it's delicious and the service is great!

The hostess kept checking in to see if our party was complete because she was holding our table, which was really nice of her and I appreciated that. I ordered the Walter's breakfast - really clean and simple, and the flavors were nicely matched. My friend got the chickpea and tomato stew - she seemed to enjoy it.

The staff is very friendly and accommodating, and we left full and happy without breaking our wallets.

Cozy little place on the corner of Fort Greene Park, great for a lively date or meeting with friends.

Fisherman's stew and French Dip were out of this world!

I believe Walter's sources bread from She Wolf but it doesn't serve bread as a matter of course when you are seated.

Don't forget about the little cocktail bar in the backroom.

We stopped by for brunch due to the 4 stars ratings on Yelp. The wait was 10-15 mins for weekend brunch after 1pm. Perhaps it was the cold weather hence not a lot of people were out and about.

The cafe was packed with hipsters and a few young families - relaxed vibes. We like the big windows which brought in a lot of light. The food was a big disappointment. We got the eggs with sausage and toast; the toast was burned and the edges of the eggs were also burnt (you can see the photos). Furthermore my frittata was a sad small piece of pie and a glob of hash brown. Not visually appealing or appetizing to say the least. Suffice to say, we were surprised this cafe had such a high ratings considering the food was bland and mediocre. The burger and fries were the only highlight from this experience.

This place is a really nice local spot with a real relaxed non pretentious crowd. My friends and I sat at the bar, and the staff, was amazingly attentive
and paired wine that matched our courses perfect!! We selected more of a tapas like selection of a few appetizers. Each one was better than the next. We had oysters on the half, from about 4 different places in the United States, Canada, and Europe. Fried green tomatoes, grilled Portuguese octopus which was to die for, and lastly deviled eggs which had a really spicy kick. Overall, I really enjoyed this place.

GREAT SPOT. It has that decor that never fails, the sort of classic, dark wood white tile, almost minimalist thing that some bars and restaurants have (i.e. The Smith). High marks on that end, can't go wrong.

The bathroom situation is bad. Only one. Always a wait.

Our waiter was the nicest guy ever. Super personable, never intrusive.

We split the smoked trout, which was great with the onion and capers mixed in. And the eggs benedict (with smoked salmon) was awesome. The bread was perfect, soft yet crispy, easy to cut. The eggs were cooked perfectly, sort of well done so not too runny.

The blood mary wasn't too impressive, but what are you gonna do?

This place has been 5 stars for many years! Even that one time my appetizer wasn't on point, this team is so great, they had a great save. I love this place. I take everyone I know here because it will always be a solid experience.

Through the years I still see a lot of the same faces working here, which shows solid ownership and management. This is one of the few places that runs like a well oiled machine. They have a lovely diverse staff that caters perfectly to their diverse guests.

In this age of increasing discrimination, this place has consistently treated me and my guests like human beings and for that, I will always support this establishment!

May Walters exist forever and always!
I love this place and all it's staff!

Excellent service . Super accommodating to my children. The Cesar salad and dry wings were a hit! My child's had the burger and no complaints there.

Atmosphere: Walter's is dark and romantic around dinnertime. It can be intimidating at first, but once you get a feel for the restaurant, it quickly becomes a cozy environment that feels like a good balance between classy and comfortable.

Service: Our server was friendly and professional. He checked on us over the course of the meal and gave a fun, lighthearted tone to the more serious ambience of the restaurant.

Food: We started with the grilled octopus and had the Roasted Chicken and Fried Chicken as entrées. The grilled octopus was very well seasoned and did not have a chewy texture. The Roasted Chicken was flavorful and cooked well; we really enjoyed this dish. The Fried Chicken was the best value item on the menu and really filled us up. We also got the Diablo and Walter's Cooler, which paired well with the chicken.

Overall: Walter's was a good choice for dinner + drinks. You get the feeling of being in an intimate, fancy restaurant without breaking the bank. Not necessarily the first choice for a dinner date but it's definitely up there. We would love to come back and try their brunch to see the change in atmosphere!

Great place for brunch! It's tiny so you'll probably have to wait for a table, but it worth it! The service is really good and the food too, they even give you some free muffins for start, and unlimited coffee refill. Huevos rancheros were very good.

I wanted to love this place but despite the great service and tasty cocktails, I couldn't because the food was just ok. We got the pork belly & grilled octopus (2 separate dishes); the octopus had lots of flavor (and the chimichurri it came with was delightful) but was a bit over done and tough. The pork belly was tasty. For mains I got the bar steak which had 0 flavor and was pretty tough (even for medium well...could be the cut of meat...wasn't quite the flank...not sure what it was). The fries and salad were good...the fries were quite possibly the best thing all dinner. Beau had the seafood stew; he luckily was full from lunch because it looks like a hearty portion but is really a lot of broth and mot that much seafood. Maybe we chose the wrong things since Yelpers love this place...but maybe not. ((Shrugs))

Very cute little spot! Went for a Sunday brunch and it was crowded, but the wait wasn't as long as some others. We waited about 25 minutes and they were very eager to get us seated, so kept checking in to say how much time was left. The brunch menu is mixed with breakfast and lunch options. I got the burger and have to say it was really delicious. The fries were okay, not my style but others at my table enjoyed them. Service was great. The restaurant has a really cute atmosphere, but is slightly intimate. Louder and upbeat energy. Crowd was diverse and there were even a couple babies. Solid place for any meal I would imagine! Would return!

Perfect spot for weekend brunch and catching up with old friends. Located right on the corner of Fort Greene Park, you can drop by the farmers market or go for a stroll afterwards. It is small restaurant with a few booths and room to sit at the bar. They take reservations for dinner only, but we didn't have to wait long for a booth around 11:30 on a Saturday. The booths area actually pretty spacious so it feels comfortable and not crowded, despite the restaurant being so small.

Menu for brunch is pretty standard, nothing too unique. The serve you yummy mini muffins to start. I tried a spinach and goat cheese omelette. It was good, but not extraordinary, other than the huge amount of spinach it was filled with. Definitely the most spinach I've ever had on an omelette, it was almost too dense.

Besides the atmosphere and friendly service, other pluses were the large portions at a reasonable price. We all left stuffed.

I really like this place from late night drinks to Sunday brunch--this place is versatile. It's a great location, easy to get to but also far enough away from Flatbush not to feel too hyped or rushed. It's a small place so it can feel a little cramped, but ultimately everyone is sweet and attentive. The food is a little pricey, but on par with the neighborhood and it's good quality.
