Friend visiting from out West said he wanted Italian, Frankies immediately came to mind. We didn't have a reservation but the hostess managed to seat us at a 4-top in the back. Scan the QR code for menu and consider the specials as well.

I started with the lentil soup ($10), a simple starter that reminded me of my mom's recipe, though hers is better, of course. My party divvied up the table bread ($4), tearing hunks off and dipping in oil and butter. I worked hard to save room for my main course.

Entree: sweet sausage with roasted peppers and onions over creamy polenta ($19). Impulsively (but correctly), I mixed it all together, ensuring even distributions in each bite.

The verdict? I loved it. The peppers were plentiful and roasted exquisitely. The sauce mingled with the polenta creating a delicious base with a superb mouth feel. The sausage was also ideal, contributing to a delicious sum total.

My guests were fairly pleased with the experience, but I had the best time. If you want something wholesome, charming, potentially romantic, and very comfy, give this a try. They've got their Covid game figured out, and the food was to die for.

A couple tips to help make your visit to Frankies 457 Spuntino super delicious and excellent:
-Even/Especially during these COVID times, make a reservation.
-If a big party (4 or more), order a pasta dish as an appetizer. We went with the sweet potato ravioli and the heirloom salad (app) and I thought that was a perfect amount.
-Order the gnocchi!!! The BEST gnocchi I've ever had. So fluffy, not dense at all. I licked that plate clean.
-Be patient. Yes, service is a little on the slower end. But again, during these COVID times, where else ya going? For me, the food was worth the wait.

Frankies 457 Spuntino was an excellent spot for lunch in Brooklyn. They have a great outdoor space which felt safe and comfortable during COVID-19.

My Mom and I ordered the caesar salad and cavatelli with hot sausage. The caesar was made with a purist approach: fairly simple, just lettuce covered in dressing. The dressing was full of flavor and brought a complexity to the simple elements of the dish. The salad was well portioned and could easily be split between two people.

Next up was the cavatelli, I'd never seen this kind of pasta before but absolutely loved it. The sausage was perfectly cooked and well seasoned. The sauce was a nice complement to the pasta and meat. Definitely recommend this dish!

Overall great service and a nice place for lunch in Carroll Gardens!

I love the food here. I've come more than a couple of times and it has never disappointed me.

Covid-19 rules are followed. The outdoor sitting as well as the patio area are equally enjoyable.. The plus of sitting outside (as opposed to the patio) is the eclectic/funky/cool/diverse crowd the neighborhood has to offer (anyone else loves to people watch as much as I do).

FOOD is an a+ ambiance, decor and service are fantastic.

Everything about dinner remains true to original review.

Before CV-19 hit it was a major treat to join Frankies for lunch/brunch. These are times I truly miss that luxury. I had discovered that their BLT is the most heavenly sandwich you could ask for. From the perfectly firm yet doughy bread, to the right amount of mayo, to the thick cut faico bacon, the deep red, just thick enough tomato and the crisp snap of a single slab of lettuce you're in heaven with one bite. After 8 bites you're probably finished wondering if you should order another.

I'm a big fan of Frankies. They have become synonymous with Carroll Gardens and for good reason. The best way to describe Frankie's atmosphere is cozy - it exudes that feeling like you've just come home after a long day. It's warm in the winter and open and airy during the summer.

Good thing they have incredible food to welcome you with! There's staples you can absolutely never go wrong with. My top pick on this list remains the cavatelli (House-Made Cavatelli $18.00). It's freshly made and skinny dipping in a browned butter sage sauce with faiccos sausage - unforgettable. A close second would be the meatballs. They are a bit simpler (and a smaller portion) but brimming with flavor including a touch of sweetness from the raisins delicately hidden throughout and delicately waist deep in some scrumptious red sauce (ask for extra bread).

Outside of those go-tos I'd highly recommend the Sweet Potato & Sage Ravioli $16.00 - which offers a great balance across savory and sweet. Of course starting with a crostini of anything is the right thing to do if you plan on enjoying a few drinks.

To close your palate, you'll be delighted to have a world class tiramisu. You'd expect this at a traditional quality Italian restaurant but Frankie's just double-strikes the meal with a perfectly airy/dense ratio and espresso topped treat.

Sit out back in the summer and close to the kitchen in the winter. Find you're having to wait, squeeze into the bar if you can and order a nice glass of wine.

Pro Tip: get their cookbook and see if you can truly top their own chefs (I've perfected the meatball according to my 7 year-old & wife).

We have been coming to Frankies for years, and have never had less than a magical time.  Food and service have always been top notch.  I am loathe to write this review, as I understand Covid has wreaked havoc on the industry and everyone is struggling to adapt in these crazy times.  However...

Our night started off on the wrong foot.  I had reserved a table for two on a Saturday night - indoors.  The hostess led us to a table outside under a tent by the open door with no heat lamp.  It was a frigid.  We asked our server if they were considering tent seating "indoors" - he said something to the effect of "indoors, outdoors, who knows anymore?"  Which was ridiculous, because the second time we asked, we were led to a table - indoors, as in, inside the restaurant.

Our server then proceeded to instruct us that when he was dropping off food or drinks on our table we should put our masks back on.   This was very awkward - at one point, I couldn't find my mask and he literally refused to put our food down on the table until I put a napkin over my face.  He also approached our table as if we were actively infected and he could see the Covid spores crawling all over us.  This might have been understandable or acceptable if the same request was made at every table!  Our same server was also waiting on a four top next to us - they remained unmasked throughout the duration of their meal. We felt like lepers!

Since the pandemic began, we have been doing everything possible to support our local restaurants.  We were under the impression that they wanted our business, and we were very happy to patronize them.  We had been looking forward to to eating a Frankies and we spent a good deal of money on our wine and dinner.  Unfortunately, the message we walked away with was that we should have just stayed home.

All that being said, food is still excellent.  The restaurant was freezing - maybe five degrees warmer than eating outdoors.  Dress appropriately.

I question whether I truly know what authentic Italian food is because I didn't like anything we ordered. Besides great service provided, Alex and I weren't thrilled with $123 bill for 2 small entrees (Cavatelli with Hot sausage and Bolognase), 3 formaggio (cheeses) and 2 old fashions.

All these great reviews and I couldn't agree less.

Not worth the money . Save your trip and time and go somewhere else .. out of all the staff I think the host are the most politest. Waitresses don't know how to talk to customers . Also be ready to wear your masks every single time the server comes up to you before they tell you impolitely to wear one  . So listen to the negative reviews you see ... If your hungry I would not come here ... Food portions are really small and a bit pricey which I don't mind paying as long as the food is worth the price. We had the Linguine short rib the chicken parm ( was really good but not hot ) and the gnocchi in pesto was good but again I would not pay for it again nor recommend. Drinks were great ! You get no bread for the table in the beginning... we had to order bread which was like 4.00 again not worth it and strange to not serve bread in the beginning of dinner . Should've listen to my friends not recommending this place but I really wanted to give it a try which I'm happy I did so I know not to recommend or visit again . Bill was around 125 left At least 18 , Should've just went to the city !

Horrible service. Asked for fresh pepper and was provided pepper packets as if I was at McDonald's... if I'm dropping 200+ on a meal and some wine you better get it right. This isn't Olive Garden. Head to Misi or Lilia and forget this once amazing spot.

Disappointed by food and service.
Orecchiette with sausage - brown butter sauce nothing special and sausage very fat (not to mention like ~1/8th pound pasta for $28 and no fresh grated parmesan ir pepper offered).
Sausage and peppers over polenta - polenta was soupy (think grits accidentally made with too much water) and just fell apart resulting in a big bowl of mush (not to mention that the s&p was not even tasty enough to make up for the failed polenta).
If you're looking for yummy Italian in an atmosphere where you feel at home and taken care of, consider looking elsewhere.

Tosca and her team at Frankies made our 25-person outdoor wedding an absolute dream come true. We could not have asked for more in terms of venue, food, and service. Due to covid and weather issues, we had to redo our seating chart multiple times. We also had various guests with dietary restrictions. Frankies was not only accommodating, they went above and beyond to make our day stress free and seamless. Our guests absolutely loved the experience and we had the best time ever. I highly recommend Tosca and Frankies if you are hoping to plan an intimate celebration (with or without covid.)

I really did want to like this place..mostly because of all the hype and the 45 minutes of my life i spent waiting to eat but..

We got:
- tagliatelle bolognese 6/10: was a pretty average dish, definitely not worth the $23. Tasted like something i couldve made at home, although the pasta itself was quite good. But the sauce and flavors lay flat
- gnocchi 5/10: the gnocchi was reaaaaaaaally soft, im not sure if they were going for that soft doughy texture but it just tasted severely undercooked to me.

Service was noticeably bad (and i dont even notice service ever), it took forever to get anything - especially to order. Also, there was a table ready but they didn't seat us for at least another 10 minutes for some strange reason..?
Also not really within their control but peeved me anyways was that there's only one bathroom for the whole establishment and it is literally in the middle of the restaurant. Practically begs for a traffic collision when you open the door.

Overall, definitely not worth the hype or the wait. Maybe the hype is around the atmosphere...? I really dont get it. Save yourself some everything and go eat at any number of the restaurants nearby.

Frankie's has become an institution. Known for many things, but manly some of the best Pasta in Brooklyn.

Frankie's is a charming spot right in Carrol Gardens. They just expanded, now enabling you to make a reservation and not fret about getting a seat.

The wine selection and cocktail list are pretty big, so you won't worry about finding what to drink. Just make sure you pair it well with your food. I love the octopus here. Definitely get that as your stater. As for the main course, you got to go with one of the pastas. None of them are bad. But I definitely recommend getting the one with sausage.

The service here is also top notch. The wait staff is fantastic. I also noticed an error with a bill awhile back, when I called up the manager fixed it right away.

A great spot for all occasions.

Every trip to New York, I prioritize getting good Italian food, and I'm so glad a friend told me about Frankie's!

THE WAIT: None on a Friday at 11:00 a.m. (when they opened). By the time we left around noon, the restaurant was almost full but still no wait.

THE COST: Incredibly reasonable. $105.06 before tips for lunch for three!

MUST-HAVES: Meatballs, Tagliatelle, Gnocchi. (My friend loved the Cavatelli but it's not for me as a pasta served more al dente.)

See my photos for more details!

There are a lot of Frankies and its confusing. This one is the original and down the block is Franks which is split into two places. A wine bar with an app menu and a reservation only side. Then there is one in Manhattan.

This one was okay. Average food and high prices. I liked the rustic atmoshpere and we sat by the window. Thier backyard is gorgeous and they have a courtyard too which looks like for weddings and other events.

17 dollars for eggplant marinara. Came with no pasta and was just eggplant in red sauce. It tasted good but not worth 17 dollars and not filling. My boyfried ordered the cavatelli with sausage. 22 dollars. The cavatelli was very good. Homemade and in a brown butter sage sauce. I'm lucky he let me eat half. The sausage I didn't care for. Too spicy for my tastes and the flavor itself I didnt like. Portions average size.

Cocktails at 14 dollars I guess is pretty typical. The spritz was actually really good. My boyfriend's drink tasted like medicine to me though, I forgot what it was called, something with bird in the title.

Overpriced average food, wouldn't come back but glad we tried it.

This is the place that does the Resy backyard chef collaborations

I can only attest to place as a wedding venue and the food that was served for the wedding.

The backyard space was amazing, tasteful, and intimate.
The food for the wedding was

1. A bunch on crostini(mushroom, pesto, chick pea, honey ricotta)- all amazing
2. Salad-very good
3. Two house made cavatellis( sausage and cauliflower) both amazing
4. Damn good meatballs with pine nuts
5. Gnocchi-light as air in tomato sauce
6. Chocolate ganache and light as air cheesecake

Awesome and friendly service. Super attentive. Can't wait to come back for regular meal service

*Only one can in backyard venue

After coming here for years since they opened, I chose Frankies to be my first sit down meal since Covid.   I wanted someplace safe and most importantly served great food.  Frankie delivered! I had the beets and avocado salad, the meatballs and shared the cavatelli and sausage. It was divine to sit outside in the breezy back patio drinking wine and leisurely enjoy a sumptuous delicious meal that just hit all the right notes of familiar and exciting at the same time.

The menu is smaller but the favorites are all there.  Service continues to be both professional and friendly.  All the patrons we saw, kept there masks on except when they were eating or drinking.  The patio is shaded and tables are well spaced.

I try my best to give people the benefit of the doubt. Honestly, I will. But Frankies 457 was not a great experience.

We walked in and asked for a table. We were quoted an hour to an hour and a half (which was fine). They called us back under an hour, for which we were grateful.

But as soon as we sat down, they told us about half the entree menu wasn't available due to an engagement party in the backyard. This included all the grill items, including the main fish and chicken dishes (they literally had no other chicken dish available, and just one fish sandwich otherwise). Would've been great to know this when we were making a reservation. It's not like they didn't know this was the case.

And then halfway into our meal, our server came over and told us we were accidentally given the wrong table. He asked if we would be willing to move in exchange for a round of free drinks. Sounded like a great deal, right? So we agreed. They made it sound like they would time it so we would move before we got our entrees, but it actually happened in the middle of them. So.... not great. And then after we move, he told us he couldn't comp us drinks and instead gave us a free dessert worth about 1/3 of our second round of drinks (that we ALREADY ordered). Seriously, what the fuck?

Also, their menu doesn't specify that adding soda to drinks costs $1, but it does. So if you get a campari or aperol with soda, expect an unexpected surcharge.

If we didn't have to deal with being jerked around, this would be a 4 or 5 star experience. But I honestly can't do that with the service we got.

I will say that the olive oil is as good as you've heard (maybe not worth the price you'd pay in a Brooklyn gourmet store, but still REALLY good). And they'll give you all the sourdough bread you ask for.

The crostini are tiny, but also delicious. The crab/avocado one is $6 and smaller than half your hand, but oh so fresh. And the ricotta/speck is similarly fresh AF.

The pork bolognese tagliatelle is also very good. Maybe not $22 good, but very good nonetheless, with big hunks of meat in it.

The staff was otherwise very kind to us, but they should really be better at setting expectations.

Not bad, but not worth the hype.

Came on NYE with a reservation for the dining room. The dining room was loud and big with straightforward lighting, reminding me of a traditional red sauce restaurant, rather than a chic neighborhood haunt. Based on my knowledge of Frankies Spuntino Group, I expected a more contemporary space/ambiance, but I guess that is not the focus at this location.

Onto the food - for a big night like NYE, the specials really weren't all that exciting, so we went ahead and ordered the much-lauded cavatelli with sausage, as well as an antipasto plate and the meatball parm. They were all pretty solid, and the cavatelli is every bit as good as people say it is. The meatball parm felt a bit dry without enough sauce.

Bottom line, I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to come here. There are more outstanding Italian spots (like Supper by the other Frank.. oop) around the city.

On a random summer night we were looking for somewhere close by to eat and decided to try some Italian! We'd heard good things about this place but were a little disappointed in the end...

While the food here was decent, our service was not. We waited on end for our waitress, even though it wasn't very busy and we were one of the few customers.

The menu is a little limited if you have meat restrictions, but what we got was fresh and delicious! A little bland for our tastes (we tend to love spices and Indian foods) but still tasty and fresh.

My boyfriend and I went here to celebrate our four year anniversary and I think it was our yummiest anniversary dinner yet! We shared the gnocchi and cavatelli and neither of us could tell which we liked better. I also got their blood orange cocktail and it was so delicious. There are multiple great outdoor areas for a social distance dining. The waiters and waitresses wore masks and wouldn't even walk up with drinks or food until you popped your mask on. I felt very safe and would def go eat there again! Make a reservation because this place is popping!

Just the best. Ate here for the first time since COVID and was surprised and delighted at their outdoor oasis behind the restaurant and storefront. The pasta impressed me every time and the appetizers & specials are always great. The staff was so friendly and attentive even masked-up.

4.5 stars. Part of the multiple Frankies related establishments on this block, we started at the one of the corner and couldn't get a table because it was booked for the night, a beautiful fall Sunday evening. The hostess called over to this one - maybe 30 steps away - and scored us a table under the string lighting and trees of the beautiful backyard. To get there, you walk through the bustle of the narrow entryway, busy bar, line for the one bathroom, and a maze of tables with loud chatter.

Then you are outside and it feels tranquil and subdued, although definitely still full of people. We had aperol spritzes, scarfed down the table bread (we were hungry), and had the burrata and a couple of the crostinis (tiny for $6 each order, but the avocado and crab one was very tasty). Entrees were simple, a yummy red sauce pasta dinner for me and the bolognese for my love. All in all, a lovely setting for a nice date night, if a bit on the pricy side.

This review would have been a three star review, and my last point below is where it came down to two.
I came here with three work folks and we opted to eat outside in the courtyard. The restaurant and courtyard are charming and pretty nice atmosphere for dining.
Our server came over and said there were no specials, everything was standard menu. We ordered some wine, a $95 bottle high acidity red to cut some of the richness of the food we were about to have.
Long story short, some of the food was better than others. (The only option for an a la carte side of broccoli rabe and garlic is for it to be served cold? Come on.)
Service was okay In the beginning with a slightly goofy waiter but rapidly deteriorated with the stops to our table becoming more infrequent as the night progressed. When we wanted to leave, we had to downright wave our arms.
Lost a star because upon delivering the wine, the server announced that he would be taking it back to the station to open and taste it for us. What?? This isn't 11 Madison or Le Berardin? I want every drop of the wine I paid for and unless you are in the highest level of formality l, the customer decide if the wine is acceptable. I didn't realize the waiter at an Italian joint in Carroll Gardens was a certified sommelier all of a sudden. When we questioned this upon his return, he said "what? Oh yeah in high end restaurants this is customary." So shocked we didn't even respond.
Oh by the way, one of our party on the way out saw him off to the side finishing off the last half glass of a bottle a customer left behind. Bizarre. Won't be back.

Frankie's is so great, they have always had such great food and service. They work really hard to make sure everyone is taken care of here and it shows. I've visited them a few times since they reopened during Covid and I'm so glad that they are taking it all very seriously. I really appreciate that they ask you to wear a mask when you are not eating or drinking, the team is doing a great job keeping everyone safe, while still delivering great food.

Please do yourself a favor and go elsewhere.  Over rated - food was mediocre at best.  Portions are a bit small - presentation of food not appealing. The staff could really take a refresher course on how to treat and speak to their customers . Our waitress was impatient and a friendly smile would have definitely been asking way too much from her.

First, Frankies is one of my long time favorites in New York.  I go here for drinks at Frank's, food at Frankie's and a quick slice at F&F.  I've always experienced excellent service, above most in New York.  That said, I have been itching to go back and have a nice dinner following their reopening amid COVID-19, and had a strangely horrible experience.  While I give them the credit for navigating the complexities of running a business during these times, what I experienced was contrary to basic hospitality principles that should extend beyond the current COVID-19 regulation.

I put my name in for the waitlist at Frankies, and when I was text for a place at a table, I was told that they actually didn't have a table ready.  They did feel bad and offered a glass of wine, and told me to hang tight another 20 minutes for a table.  I gladly did this and was seated 20 minutes later at their outdoor seating outside Frank's (their sister wine bar).  After waiting for another 15 minutes, I poked my head inside to ask my waiter if I could order food because the QR code I was given only had wines.  I was then told that they can't do Frankie's food menu here but the waiter understood the miscommunication and said he'd go try and sort it out with the host who sat me.  After waiting another 15-20 minutes, the waiter didn't come back so I poked my head inside again to see what was going on, to which I was told that they can't serve me over here and they would be happy to sit me somewhere else where I could order food in another 20-30 minutes.  This was appalling, I felt embarrassed, so I just go up and left after waiting for probably an hour in total.  I don't know if I was treated this way because it was just me and I didn't have a huge party, but I will definitely rethink the next time I plan an event and want to go to my stable neighborhood favorite!!

I used to come here frequently and I think it's great that they opened for outdoor dining however, you should not ask customers that are sitting at the table eating to put their mask on every single time a server comes to the table, especially midway eating. This is very uncomfortable and very irritating to keep taking it on and off when you have food in your mouth and this is the only restaurant that does this. If staff feels some type of way about serving during this time, then don't serve and don't keep wearing the same gloves to handle everyone's food without changing them.

We also were refused coffee , as we were told "we only serve the bare minimum." I was just wondering what COVID has to do with coffee ? These places want to make money or not ? Serving an espresso and a tiramisu won't increase your changes of catching the virus.

7/17/2020Hi Lisa: Thank you for your feedback. We're sorry to hear you were inconvenienced by our safety protocols. We should clarify that we only require masks when guests are not at their table. That said, we do appreciate those who choose to wear a mask whenever interacting with a server to help protect them when they are at your table.  Our menu is currently limited and unfortunately we aren't serving coffee right now due to supply chain issues.  However, we are working hard to expand our menu over the coming weeks and appreciate your feedback.  These are difficult times, so we thank you for your patronage over the years and especially now.

This is one of New York's best restaurants and even more so during COVID because of their beautiful backyard. Highlights include perfectly fresh burrata, the most-authentic Caeser this side of the Atlantic, a delectable slow-roasted cold-sliced rib eye, and mouth-watering gnocchi. Only thing I don't recommend is the cacio e pepe, which is over peppered causing the buttery cheese taste to be completely lost in a dish that is meant to symbolize the Italian version of perfect balance (like yin and yang).

Food was cooked and prepared fresh! I ordered the Polenta and Bolognese. Was greeted by the hostess and sat quickly on a busy Saturday night.

Warm ambiance and upbeat music/ atmosphere. The place is live- it does have a lot going on (loud environment, kitchen cooks in front) but thats what keeps it lively.

The waitress was very friendly and made sure the dishes were out in a timely manner. Polenta was creamy and rich. The topping red peppers were not too sweet and onions complimented the sauce well. Very balanced and proportioned. Overall, I would give this a 8/10. The only downfall was the portion was small, but I think the restaurant was going for the 'small plates style'.

The Bolognese was very flavorful and seasoned thorougly. Taste was very warm and noodles were light and delicious. Very meaty! Overall, i would give this dish a 8.6/ 10.

Good pasta and vibes, great for a pleasant evening.

Maybe it was just the pleasantness of the restaurant, the whiff of olive oil in the air, but this particular restaurant delivered an almost perfect meal.

We arrived, off-hour but reservation-less, mid-afternoon on a Saturday, and the place was already packed. We put our name on the list, got our waitlist doo-dad, and sooner, rather than later, our number was called.

Our waiters were gracious, the drinks wonderful, but the highlight was the pasta. In particular, the sweet potato ravioli was beyond comparison. Just  a really, really satisfying dish.

In fact, while the pastas weren't incredibly complex, each and every dish we had was special in its simplicity.

I think that's the recipe for success for this restaurant (an experience which we still think about on occasion). Simple, but special. Good times, man...

Where to begin... cavatelli with sausage and browned butter *chefs kiss* is a must order! One of the best pasta dishes I've ever had.

Other faves are the gnocci and the meatballs they're out of this world. All the crostinis are good but I love the mushroom/truffle and ricotta ones.

Make sure to leave room for the chocolate tart or tiramisu!!

This place was recommended to me by a coworker and it did not disappoint! We ordered 3 difference types of cheese, meatballs, cavatelli, gnocchi, and wine (of course).

The cheese was amazing. Great portions and lovely flavor. Same with the meatballs. They paired really nicely together. Both pasta dishes were delicious, although I would go with the gnocchi over the cavatelli only due to the cavatelli being a little too salty for my taste.

One of Brooklyn's great Italian Restaurants. Newly added wine bar a few doors down from the original has the same menu, look and feel, with more room.  The space is very comfortable, with lots of wood paneling reminiscent of a high end steakhouse, a wonderful skylight that makes the lighting very nice.
The food is outstanding here. The cavatelli with sausage is a knockout.  You MUST order, if only to share with your party as we did.
Not everything was perfect:  the salads were just ok, and the service failed to time our meal properly. (Received entree before appetizer and salad was served with entree). Of the eight of us, two people had to wait another ten minutes for their meal.  Server seemed clueless. Five star rating forfeited because of dysfunctional service.
Other than that, we really enjoyed our brunch here.

Can't find a bad thing to say about this place!! Service was just about spot on and the food was interesting as well as delicious. We shared two apps  roasted beets with avocado and the fresh bufula mozzarella with arugula. Both were yum. There were 5 of us and each one of us loved there dish. I had the gnocchi topped with ricotta which was mind blowing delicious and oh so filling. The other pastas had were the lemon pasta, bolognese, and there was an eggplant parm too. I'll need to go back to try some of the other dishes, when I get the chance too.

Good, but overpriced and with too small/limited a menu. My boyfriend moved in right down the block from Frankie's in April and we've been ordering from there a lot. Your first order on seamless is 35% off which is what hooked us.

Generally, I get the gnocchi with marinara and he gets the cavatelli with brown butter, sage, and sausage. The pastas are $19 and $21, respectively. I think for the portion size and the fact that the gnocchi is incredibly simple and meatless, they're both steeply overpriced. The meatballs ($19 I think) are large and delicious. Bread and olive oil is $3.50 and the last time I ordered it it was the most outrageously small piece of bread. Think the size of a dinner roll. If you're going to make people pay for bread and olive oil, at least give a more generous hunk.

Along with one other pasta dish, one sausage dish, and some sandwiches, that's pretty much the whole menu. Really not many choices. I think the plan is to expand it when Prime Meats closes/is merged with Frankie's.

All in all, definitely worth a try once, especially since that 35% off is killer. Does it deserve its buzz though? I say no

They're doing delivery now and it travels super well. Their Caesar salad is incomparable, the cavatelli is sumptuous, the sweet potato ravioli is delicate and silky, and how can we not get the meatballs?? My husband said they're
like his Sicilian grandmother's but better. So glad they're doing their eggplant now too and excited to try the gnocchi with pesto - the one with marinara is a classic. Welcome back Frankies!
