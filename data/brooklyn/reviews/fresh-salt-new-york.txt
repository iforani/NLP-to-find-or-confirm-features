Love Fresh Salt. The staff is the best, the food is delicious and very reasonably priced, the atmosphere is lively but not manic - really appreciate the total lack of obnoxious frat boys - and the neighborhood vibe is very cozy with lots of good dog watching :)  Cleanliness and social distancing are impeccable, too. Really like all of it, but if I had to pick just one aspect that keeps me going back it would be the wonderful staff.

Nice outdoor area with plenty of seating and room between tables. Food was pretty good. The pepper turkey sandwich was a little lackluster, but the atmosphere and service made up for it. Mac and cheese was good.

Brooo The artichoke dip is to die for. It was hearty and gooey and just the perfect ratio. I think I could eat it once a week. Only wish was pita was flashed grilled or something but whatever.

I would also go as far to say the cocktails were very cheap considering it's in Financial District. I would have rate this place closer to one dollar sign than two.

Yes! Come here for Happy Hour, service is usually quick, the drinks are reasonably priced, the beverage choices are expansive, the space is cozy but not loud, and the location is very convenient for lots of FiDi workplaces.

But, I would say, do not come here for a meal or even bar snacks (beyond potato chips). They don't have fries or wings or any bar food to go with your drinks (which is usually fine by me, but just a note for others). The selection is pretty slim across the board (some salads and quiche). Though they do have a few sandwiches for lunch, which are good, but nothing special. The prices are high considering the portion size for the area, but not by much. A sandwich will set you back $18 (plus tax/tip). Service is standard, and the ambiance is nice.

Truly a great spot in the heart of the South Street Seaport area. Daily happy hour deals (even on Sunday) really seals a spot for me. It's cool spot to grab a drink at a table or hang at the bar. Great selection of wines and beers at a VERY reasonable price. The true star here came from another Yelper: the artichoke dip is probably the best version of this I've ever had or probably will eat. It came out hot, cheesy, creamy, and full of so much flavor and plenty of pita to go around. Looking forward to coming back here when the weather is better and trying some more delicious things on their menu and getting some more of those inexpensive drinks.

Came here for happy hour because I was in the area. They have deals on drafts and wine from 4-8pm. There are some seats outside but you have to go inside to order.

They also have a full food menu but I did not try anything.

The bartender was friendly and the place was pretty empty when I got there around 4:30 but by 6:30 it started to pick up.

Great find! Most happy hour places are so insanely crowded it's almost not worth the cheaper drinks. I will definitely be back!

I've been to Fresh Salt a couple of times in the past,  and when it comes to being in a comfortable environment to catch up with friends, this place does not fail to please.

First, finding a venue that has happy hour  isn't so easy in the vicinity, and theirs is quite good.
Happy hour specials run from 4 pm to 8 pm and it includes: $6 wine such as Rose, Sauvignon Blanc & Montepulciano as well as $5 draft beer and well drinks.
In addition, their craft cocktails normally $12 were $8.

There was no table service therefore orders must be placed at the bar for both food and drink---however, food was served to the table once ready.

We settled in the back part of the establishment but there were also seats at the bar and when the weather permits--outdoor dining.

Their menu in terms of food was simple but diverse: sandwiches, salads, dips for sharing (hummus & artichoke) and additional plates.

For drink, I selected Rose while my friends opted for the red.
We also ordered food upon which two of my friends chose the meatloaf sandwich while I went with the breaded eggplant sandwich.

Most entrees averaged at $12 with some less expensive items.
My sandwich was breaded eggplant (assuming it was fried) with mozzarella and pesto on a ciabatta bread.  I chose a salad rather than potato chips to accompany the delicious sandwich.
My friends enjoyed their meal very much.

Fresh Salt is a cute, homey type of establishment with good choices. Music seemed to be of the 60s genre all evening.

This place is an old reliable.

This place is incredible! We stopped in here after dinner for a drink and stayed for 3 hours!
Anne was our bartender and took great care of us! She knows how to move the crowd. She's passionate about her job and it shows- we appreciate that!
Her decision to take requests for one hit wonders really got people excited and jivey. It could not have been a more perfect night if she didn't play and dance to Oops! by Tweet ft. Missy Elliott.
Please come check out this perfect bar near the waterfront. Totally clean, energetic place and full of fun energy!

Cute little neighborhood spot in the seaport. Three of us came here last night after ice skating at Pier 17. It was valentines day so we knew a lot of the restaurants in the area would have been packed with romantic, date night vibes, and that wasn't what we were looking for, so this place was perfect. Low key, small restaurant.

There are no waitresses or waitress service, so you order everything at the bar. We got there right before happy hour ended which was great, so we got their Greenport beer. Not totally sure what it was, but their only HH beers were their three on draft, and she said that one was the most similar to a Bud Light, so it worked for us. This place has a very small menu, mostly sandwiches. I had the eggplant sandwich with pesto, mozzarella, and tomato on ciabatta and it was delicious. Really enjoyed it.

I didn't mind the no waitress service, and have been to plenty of places like that, but the only thing I didn't like was the bartenders weren't very friendly. It was not crowded at all, and when we ordered drinks and then again when we order food, we had to wait at the bar a bit bc either the bartender was taking shots, or talking or just not being helpful. Then when I was walking back to my table w 3 pints of beer, one of the bartenders, was just standing by the tables watching me, without offering to help. I don't think it would have been a big deal to help and it would have gone a long way.

I definitely would come back as I liked the food and it was a chill spot to hangout. There were also a bunch of other sandwiches I would have wanted to try.

Came here on a whim because the exterior looked cute, their food was really good! I ordered mac & cheese, and also shared some strawberry pancakes with my friend. Light and summery, the area is nice and welcoming.

They have a few tables for outdoor seating, which would be really great when it's nice out.

Love this spot! It's a charming little restaurant in the historic seaport district with a great ambiance. Nice music, not very loud in here.

Came for lunch, but I've also been here for brunch and happy hour. Great happy hour deal! The brunch menu is small but great quality food.

Ordered the chicken sandwich for lunch and it's fantastic. I highly recommend this spot for a nice, quiet meal!

I ordered from seamless around 530pm, and I'm not sure if the menu changes throughout the day, but not everything I saw on yelp was available to order. I ended up getting the eggplant sandwich with pesto, mozzarella, and tomatoes. I had to pick a side so I chose the Mac and cheese. Delivery was quick, and when it arrived it was still hot.

The sandwich was good and I would probably order it again. It wasn't too big or too small although I did end up eating the Mac and cheese right after. The Mac and cheese didn't impress me at all. The cheese wasn't really good, and it wasn't gooey and stringy, or creamy, the way I personally like it. Amy's microwaveable Mac and cheese is better.

If I had gotten a different side I would still give it three stars. Was happy with the delivery and the sandwich wasn't bad, but this won't be a go-to place for me.

My first time at the spot and it felt like home. Happy hour til 8pm! Thank you very much! The bartender Laila was lovely. I had margaritas with some co-workers and they were delicious. It was a blistering cold night on Friday. Taco plays was closed for a private event. Another bar around the corner let us down when we realized there waa no happy hour on Friday. (Really? You gone just br as our hearts like that? LMAO) And then...there was Fresh Salt. Like a beacon of light whispering...'come in...come in....' and then? We did! Drink we're awesome. It seemed like a really fun neighborhood or local spot. I chatted it up with a regular there and had a pretty great convo. It also smelled like they server food but I wasn't hungry. Cozy, warm, and it wasn't a huge bar but it was a intimate space. I'm definitely going back there again! Cheers!

Cute and simple, Fresh Salt a great place to stop in and have a drink or a bite to eat. I had their tuna salad on pita bread with a side of homemade sea salt chips, it was very good! The tuna was very tasty, it could have used just a tad more mayo; the pita was nice and fluffy so all together it was a solid tuna sandwich. The chips were lite and super crunchy, I really enjoyed them, they come in several flavors too. Great place whether you're on your lunch break or in the area.

Came here twice for their happy hour. They have a few tables outside to sit on a nice day. And a few tables inside. I believe their happy hour runs from 4pm until 7 or 8pm and no waiter service, must order at the bar. I mostly come here for the beer, they have a good IPA on tap that is cold and crisp and only 5 bucks during happy hr...cant beat that in the area!

Can't say much about the food as we only had the artichoke dip which was really not good.

Service from the bartender was friendly and fast.

I think this place is a cool bar to hang out in for after work drinks or maybe a date. It feels very cozy and has fun music playing. That being said, it isn't the best if you want a sit down dinner. First of all, table service ends after 4pm so you have to order everything at the bar and then get your own water, glasses, etc. the menu isn't huge, mostly sandwiches and salads.

I came for dinner after an outdoor concert at the seaport nearby and had been wanting to check this place out anyways. I ordered the turkey and Brie sandwich with a side of quinoa. The sandwich was pretty good- it comes on nice toasted whole grain bread. The turkey was cold though so it would have been nice if the whole sandwich had been grilled, not just toasted bread and then put together. The quinoa salad was ok, not bad but nothing special.

The drink I ordered, (I think the Beekman) was quite good though. If I were to go back it would probably be for happy hour since all the cocktails sounded really good!

I came here for a small birthday drinks. I liked the food (had a pita dip) ambience and seating of this place. Around midnight it wasn't packed but it wasn't empty either which was nice. The music was on point, too, contemporary hiphop played at a volume conducive for conversation. I was having a fun time until an interaction with the bartender. She sounded sarcastic and angry in response to my asking for a water refill and ordering a menu item. I felt as if I had stepped into a bizarro world as otherwise the place felt warm and friendly. It was the kind of behavior that my thought instinctively was that if I were a six foot man this would not be happening. As it was, I had to draw on that almost-40 wisdom and disengage from the bad vibes. But for this encounter, I would have given the place four stars.

Decent NY happy hour - for some outdoor seating and $6 wine you can't go wrong. You order at the bar and seat yourself. I don't think it is anything to write home about but if you are in the area it is worth the stop for a cheap drink!

Simple basic brunch.  But I think they are known for their speck. Speck is another word for hard core thick slab bacon. The atmosphere is charming. Great for neighborhood dedicated brunch spot but not a life changing experience.

Brunch menu is lean and basic.

I went there with my colleagues. I do very disappointed that they don't serve chicken wings. Which bar doesn't carry chicken wings? Excuse me? Also, more disappointed, they are lack of servants as well. They don't even have patience to listen if I will order alternative options. Little space. Long waiting. No one ask if you want anything.

Absolutely disappointed. I walked in my n a local night.. thay where rude and the bartender was disappointing. Thay preferred to treat it like their College dorm rather than a professional bar.
I was never offered anything special no particular appetizers or their specialty drink for the night.
$20 of disappointment.

I love that there is this completely not obnoxious spot nestled in a neighborhood rife with obnoxious bars.

Lush leather booths, smooth hard wood tables and bar, fresh flowers bursting out of bud vases, outdoor tables, plate glass windows for cheerful light in the daytime, and dim ambiance in the evening.

This is a great place to plan a get-together with a group of people. My friend had his law school graduation party here in the large corner booth and it was perfect. Also great for a summer evening date, paired with a walk on the water and a drink at the outdoor tables here. A good spot for a working lunch as well or a drink meeting.

The noise level is usually fine and the service is good. At peak times be prepared to wait a little. After table service hours end at 10pm be ready to bring your orders to the bar.

The craft cocktail section of the menu offers a full selection and specials are written on the chalk board on the far side of the bar.

A nice spot in a neighborhood whose selection of casual bars is overrun with bars catering to frat boys. Keep this one in your repertoire of places for dates, meetings, or just a nice solo cocktail.

My husband and I love to stumble upon new places to eat and drink while visiting the city, which is how we found FreshSalt while in Fulton Market.  We absolutely loved it.  We arrived shortly before brunch ended on Saturday afternoon, with the intent of getting a snack and some drinks.  We ended up splitting the Pepper Turkey on Ciabatta sandwich, which came with a small side salad.  It was delicious.  They also had another Pepper Turkey sandwich on their main menu.  The bunch version had fig and brie, whereas the main menu version has green apples, brie, and mustard.  I can imagine both are amazing, but I loved the fig jam.

For drinks, my husband stuck with beer, but I tried their cocktail, The Beekman, which was very refreshing for a bourbon based drink.  After that, I made the switch to wine.  Some may not like this, but I actually appreciated that they did not have a huge selection of wines, just three reds and two whites.  I think it makes choosing much easier.  I also could have easily picked another cocktail, as they all sounded divine.

Our quick bite and relaxing drink turned into a couple of hours enjoying Happy Hour with some regulars while sitting at the bar.  We genuinely had a great time hanging out and talking with everyone.  I love the feel of this restaurant, that it can be a great brunch location as well as late night bar spot.  I definitely hope to come back when we visit again!

Sometimes come here if I need a place for a fairly casual lunch and also seating.

They have a number of sandwiches which cost about $10 a piece. I've tried a few different types and have generally been pleased. Comes with a side of salad typically.

Service is fairly quick and also friendly.

Decent enough lounge type spot. Upon coming the first thing stated is that table service time is over so all orders have to be made at the counter. This is fine but "Hi welcome to Fresh Salt" sounds nice too. Looks a bit low on staff so it restricts the staff to food prep and drinks. I just went with a cocktail and the three cheese pita melt. Cocktail was ok and priced about right, pita melt was as described. Good but about what you expect at a tavern type spot. With a few friends this is the type of place to come for a drink or two before moving on to the main event. The ambience is dim with some eclectic music and is probably a bit more inexpensive than some of the other nearby spots but it's ok. Perhaps its a bit better for lunch, as it looks - a pass through spot for a few drinks.

We've been to Fresh Salt twice and each time great food, atmosphere and service.   The 1st time we sat at the bar for cocktails and small plates and it was nice. The 2nd time we got a table for 4 and had brunch.  When we're downtown again we'll definitely be stopping in!

Used to work here so maaaaaybe I'm biased but if you want an amazing Bloody Mary, look no further, you're going to get it here. Who needs bacon, shrimp, and all the frills?! Does come with pickled string beans though. Yummm. Dina and Layla make the best Bloody...hands down. I also happen to be drinking one at the moment. I'm sure I'll have another.
Great neighborhood bar. Great bartenders. Good food. Miss working here.

An ideal neighborhood spot, just as good for walk in brunch as it is for uncrowded late night drinks. The lack of crowds don't make it any less cool.

At brunch the croissant sandwich with thick cut (seriously thick!) bacon is my go to. Late at night for that last on-your-way home drink sit at the bar with the regular who knows the bartender.

It's casual and comfortable and just right.

After a nice cruise over at the seaport, was able to finally visit Fresh Salt after their brunch hours (that part of their menu looks lackluster). Space isn't very big, but not many people at 3pm on a Saturday, with indoor and outdoor seating.

Ordered the homemade meatloaf ($10) and substituted fries for mac n cheese ($3). Huge meatloaf with horseradish mayo served with lettuce on a sesame bun. Very filling meal, though could have used some more sauce (not much of a complaint). Mac and cheese was divine, nicely crisped on top and heavy cheese throughout. Meal would have been better with some hot sauce but was too hungry to care. Got a can of cider ($8) to wash it all down.

If this place isn't packed, a good spot as any for a filling meal.

Great place for brunch! We sat outside and they are super dog friendly. It's fairly limited seating outside.

Brunch Food: Mac n cheese and side salad is a good choice. It's a typical flavored mac n cheese served in a regular bowl. I'd highly suggest the SALT sandwich. It has a spice to it due to the chipotle aioli sauce but very good! It comes with a side salad and the sandwich has a lot of greens in it too and is pretty hefty. The speck they have in the sandwich is good. Parts of it were a little tough but for the most part tasty. There aren't any drink specials for brunch, so you have to pay regular prices for drinks but the moscato is always a good go to for brunch.

It seems they have good happy hour specials too, so looking forward to check out happy hour and have dinner here soon!

It seems they have good happy hour specials too, so looking forward to check out happy hour and have dinner here soon!

This place confused me... its very small and quite dive-y, but they only have three beers on tap and have a bunch of fancy signature cocktails. A friend and I came towards the end of happy hour. I was looking forward to getting some happy hour beer, but since they only have three options and none appealed to me, I opted for a glass of wine instead.

I'd read that the food here is good so we decided to try some sandwiches for a casual dinner. I got the eggplant sandwich with a side of mac and cheese and it was actually awesome and really filling. It seems that the food is the best thing about this place. After happy hour ended I decide to try one of their signature cocktails, the Beekman. It was pretty good but nothing special... this isn't really a place I'd choose if I wanted to drink cocktails.

They have a lot of tables but no table service after lunch so you have to go order all food and drinks at the tiny crowded bar which is not easy. Also there's only one unisex bathroom and its gross.

Fantastic bar, a hidden gem.  Tremendous services and a taste of Manhattan done right. 10/10 would live here if I could.  When in doubt, ask for the "special".  Thanks.

I tried to come here last year and it was PACKED.  So on a rainy Monday night, I made it happen.  The food was simple and delicious, the cocktails were yummy, and service was great.  The space was also super cute.  I would def go back to check it out - tho late night will be your best bet to get a table.
