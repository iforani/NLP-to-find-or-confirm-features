Small and cozy place with interesting cocktails!!
We literally ordered all their cocktails.. My favorite was Pacific Crest Trail which was jalape√±o infused tequila drink and Fiona apple which is a bourbon based drink.
Their Midnight oil drink was quite interesting.. it actually had Wasabi and Ginger!!! Can you believe that!!!
We also ordered their garlic fries which was yummy!! Its a small place so can get quite full..however we were 10 people on a Saturday evening and got ample seats to sit.

This place is nice. It's dimly lit. Very warm and inviting literally. You might break a sweat. They have a few tables and a long bar. They're happy hour is pretty damn good. I had the build-your-own charcuterie. That's not what it's called! I decided that's pretty much what it is. You choose whatever cheese and meat you want and it automatically comes with certain accompaniments. I was there relaxing and chatting with friends. There no rush. The staff is friendly and it got busy. When we left someone was ready to scoop up our table. The train station at Clark Street is nearby. And its also walking distance from Brooklyn Bridge Park and the Time Out Market.

Came with two other people on a weeknight and got a table right away. I had the There will be blood to drink, and shared the Shishito peppers, Grilled octopus, Duck confit tostadas and Parmesan garlic fries. The duck was cold (not sure if it was supposed to be) so that was a little off-putting, but everything else was delicious. I loved my drink (I'm a sucker for anything with blood orange) and out of the food, the fries were my favorite.

I stopped in for drinks on Halloween and had a great time. They had decorated the whole bar and it had a spooky vibe. I tried a few cocktails off their special menu and really enjoyed them. Nicole the bartender was super helpful in describing the drinks. One of them was a take on a Trinidad sour which I didn't know existed, but using some pumpkin related ingredient. It was one of the most interesting drinks I've ever had and absolutely delicious.

I also got the chance to try some of the food. I ordered a burger, medium rare, which came out perfectly cooked and delicious. I got about half way through until my girlfriend arrived and gobbled up the rest, remarking on how good it was. We also went with the meat and cheese plate which we liked. I would 100% recommend asking for extra bread because you're going to need it. It was pretty dark so I couldn't tell exactly what the cheese were but there was a salty probably Italian cheese, a milder cheese, and something what was definitely goat or sheep's milk based. The meats looked like some sopresta and maybe speck or prosciutto. Overall a solid meat and cheese plate for $21.

I'll definitely be back here in the future. From the other reviews it sounds like I need to make sure to hip up happy hour, $8 for a cocktail here is a bargain.

The drinks here are creative, sensational and delicious!  The food matches the quality of the food as well! However the mixologists here take care of their drinks whether happy hour specials or not - they take pride in their creations which absolutely shows and is appreciated!  I say get all the drinks and pad your stomach with a delicious burger!  I am not a fan of the restaurants along the street so if you can find a table - I'd do drinks and dinner here! They wont disappoint you! I promise!

Fun cocktail bar with pretty good happy hour deals.

$8 basic cocktails until 7:30 and $4 Gansett bottles (didn't even know that was a thing).

The Manhattan was great and strong. The Vodka Southside was simple but delicious. Our bartender Nicole was awesome.

They share a bathroom with Bevacco and there are only two, so if it's busy, it might be a bit of a wait.

Also the last Tuesday of the month is Tiki Tuesday!

This spot is PERFECT for date night. Low lighting, music is at a low volume, booths & bar seating. All around divine.

I had the Raspberry Road. It was perfection.
My companion found a really delicious mezcal-based drink.
They have a lot of beer and wine offerings.
All the drinks were tasty and they were served in fun glasses with pretty garnishes.

Employees were attentive without being overbearing and seemed like they were always up for a good conversation or an encouraging word in regards to the menu.

Drinks on the menu were $14. Allowing the bartender to make you a surprise drink (you choose the liquor and then let them go to town) runs $15. They may also have small plates?

This place is the jam. Good drinks, great service, AND it's steps away from the A/C train so you don't have to stumble home very far. Check it out!

Four stars on the food and five stars on the ambience and drinks here - the epitome of a sweet, intimate and cool spot to come for a date or hangout with a friend that you know will be filled with juicy relationship details and life ponderings.

Had a crispy Peroni at the marble bar and we split the sriracha wings, fries with garlic and Parmesan, and quinoa-asparagus bowl.

All were very good - not groundbreaking but great compliments to feeling tipsy. The wings were the standout and tasted like sesame chicken at a Chinese restaurant which was satisfying with my beer! I'm not dying to go back but I'd definitely come back for a last-min get together.

This is a fun and friendly spot to have a few drinks. The staff makes you feel right at home. They have a great variety of drinks on their happy hour menu especially the Vodka drink with mint, which I absolutely love.  Food is excellent, I enjoyed the fries with garlic oil, and they are one of the best I have ever tried.  The serving of the fries was massive. My belly was full after a couple of them. This is one of the best places I've been. Totally recommend it.

What a great place to end up on a rainy evening... With a smoky almond Mezcal cocktail. The ambience of this bar and adjacent restaurant is very classic prohibition. I can count on one hand the number of five star ratings I have given to places; but, for some odd reason, this place just flipped all the switches. Maybe it is the very cool 'candle scale' at the center of the bar. Maybe it's the very hip music vib that syncs with the Decor. Maybe it's the excitement of coming to Brooklyn for the first time. But whatever it is, kudos to all the previous yelp reviewers that beckoned me to this place!

We've lived around the corner from Binc for the past few years and decided to try their "famous" Binc Burger. Unfortuantely, we were both disappointed (we've had our fair share of NYC burgers).

The bar and atmosphere is awesome. Dark, cozy, romantic date spot. We sat at the bar and service was spot-on. Their artichoke appetizer was delicious (but very small portion).

Anywho, let's go back the Binc Burger. The burger was quite dry and under-seasoned, the bun was way too doughy for the thin beef patty, while the fancy cheese they used didn't seem to add anything to the experience. Could've used some acidity, if you don't mind be being a pretentious burger snob. I was just expecting more considering how patrons and the establishment seem to showcase the shit out of this burger.

On the first bite, one can immediately tell that the beef quality is nothing up to par with the likes of Brindle Room (East Village) or even two8two (Cobble Hill) or Long Island Bar (also on Atlantic) which are in the area. If you're looking to eat a delicious burger, head to those spots!

Also, all burgers at a place like this should include a side of fries. Don't charge extra. They were good though.

Come for the atmosphere and drinks. Nothing more.

Good night.

Came here on a Friday night and they had few drinks on their happy hour menu ($8 drinks) so I got a Manhattan, which was made well.

For food, we got the sirarcha hot wings, they were really good and not spicy like they sound. Overall, they were flavored well.

We also got the mac and cheese, which was good but nothing extra ordinary.

The place is small and cozy, I loved it!

Our server was friendly and quick.

Definitely recommend this place for some drinks and tapas/small plates.

There is one great bartender left. As as a tourist to Brooklyn when a group of thugs who think they are tough because they have strength in numbers are regulars you have to question why go to such a place.

Very disappointed that the local "workers" in the area are wannabe gangsters who have something to prove. Grow up children and this includes the owners. Know your clientele.

I come here for the sweet happy hour. Vodka drink with mint doesn't sound fancy or special, but it finds a way to be exactly that. All other drinks on happy hour awesome as well. Also have had the power boy which was fantastic, but if you need a "light" snack for the group, the fries are massive and close to best fries I've had at s restaurant. Well worth it. HH till 7:30! Score!

Lovely little bar! It's perfectly cozy with dim lighting and friendly service. Our party of three shared a charcuterie board and a great bottle of prosecco for a decadent late night treat. Would go back for another relaxing, low-key night.

I was staying in Brooklyn for one night and was grabbing drinks with a friend, so she suggested checking out The Binc before eating dinner. I was asking the bartender what they recommended on the menu and they actually made a custom made cocktail based off my likes/dislikes. It turned out great and even my friend's Hatchet Jack was made perfectly. I then ordered the Isla Calavera and was surprised how smooth it went down for a tequila drink. We also shared a Hatchet Jack that had a complex taste, but worked really well in the end.

The way the bar is setup is great to have a conversation with another person, so we ended up staying longer and that started to cut into my dinner. I ordered the pastrami tacos and cheese plate, but was completely let down by both. The pastrami tacos had a strange aftertaste while the cheeses included on the plate were a bit harder than we would have liked. I would have given this place 4 stars if it wasn't for the food, but I'd come back for the cocktails if I'm in the area.

Hit up the binc on a Wednesday night to find ourselves in an incident location with great ambience. They have a wide variety of drinks selections including some great craft beer. Bartender/mixologist knows his stuff and is quite friendly. Had the binc burger and the wings both were excellent definitely a great spot if you're in the neighborhood.

A swanky old world cocktail bar with retro black and white hexagon floor tile, intimate, dim lighting located in Brooklyn Heights that offers Happy Hour and small plates.  After attending a poetry reading nearby hunger pangs strike hard as I was enticed for a cocktail and some small plates.  Upon arrival the business appears small similar to a caf√© size.  I was the sole customer after thirty minutes upon opening the business on a Saturday evening, ergo I was serviced immediately.  My server George was prompt, polite, attentive and made suggestions for cocktail.  Manhattan cocktail is listed in their menu which is an essential basic since the drink originated in New York City in the early 1870s.  Happy Hour is available everyday for cocktails only.  The bill is submitted to the customer embedded in a wine cork with the business's postcard- innovative and a fresh outlook rather than the standard traditional black leather guest book.

Mexican Mule $8.00- tequila and sliced jalape√±o and ginger beer crushed ice with fresh lime served in a highball.  Drink was ok, nothing to boast for greatness as it was too much crushed ice than the drink main ingredients and I am not a fan of jalape√±o.  I did tasted the ginger beer.

Truffle Fries $9.00 -roasted garlic aioli with mayo and ketchup but disappointedly no sea salt.  The portion was abundant which can be shared.  The fries appears very burnt.  In the NYC French fry scene, the golden rods from Pommes Frites are covered in sea salt and served in a white paper cone while competitors use parsley and chives but, disappointedly, The Binc uses neither.

Pastrami Tacos $14.00 - three short rib pastrami tacos covered in mustard seed a√Øoli, cornichons, and cilantro with fresh lime.  The meat was extremely dry and somewhat stale or not fresh.  I prefer pulled pork rather short rib.  The cornichons (pickled cucumber) were microscopic small and mustard seed a√Øoli green spread or sauce was very minimal as I was unable to swallow for the blandness.  I like the soft shell of the taco.

Note:  The Binc opens late either 5 pm or 6 pm because they close at 2 am in the morning.  Visa and MasterCard accepted only for credit/debit cards.

This is a cozy spot (love the lighting) with a generous happy hour- $8 cocktails every day til 7:30. They also serve my favorite beer right now the Forever Ever IPA. But what pushed this review to a 5 were the fries with garlic aioli. They were so delicious- and I've had many a fry in my day! Service was top notch. My only recommendation would be to make the bathrooms gender neutral so there are two options for everyone instead of one.

I recently went on a cocktail date here. We sat at the bar and ordered a few drinks. Their happy hour ends at 7:30, so we caught the tail end of that. My first drink was a well-made Manhattan. My second was something the bartender made for me after I told him what I liked.  It had scotch and orange something from what I could taste. Either way, it was smoky and I liked his confidence.  My date enjoyed his drinks as well.

Drinks, bartender, bar back, atmosphere, all of that would garner 5 stars, but minus 1 star for the sad cheese plate.

From a cocktail bar, I expected a little more effort.  The cheese plate included 3 pieces of oiled toast, three piles of distinct cheeses, and a handful of toasted walnuts. What it was missing was a jam, a jelly, a mustard, a condiment of sorts to bring the cheese and bread together.  Maybe I especially feel this way because all the cheeses were hard cheeses, not one soft, so it all felt kinda dry.

Either way, I would go back if in the neighborhood, or for a cocktail date.

This cocktail bar has a list of cocktails that will interest any fan of mixed drinks. The menu is short but well presented. This is not a large place but with a 1920's feel is most refreshing.

Great spot for cocktails and food!
I loved the vibe and decor. It was cool being able to go up to the bar and have a waitress so there was never a shortage of drinks.
Everything tasted great and got me sufficiently buzzed for not so much money .

These restrooms were amazing !!! It was a pleasure to relieve some bladder stress in there .

As relatively new Brooklyn residents, we're still exploring all the restaurant options in and around where we live. We've been working our way down Henry Street and finally got to visit The Binc for happy hour and a light dinner.

First of all, the atmosphere. Very cozy and intimate. It's a relaxing place to enjoy their awesome cocktails. Try the Corpse Reviver #2. Delicious.

#2: The staff. Very friendly and helpful and the speed of service was fabulous. This feels like a neighborhood bar where you are treated as a regular even if you've never been there before.

Finally, the food. Every single thing we ordered was really, really good. Not just "okay" but amazing! Simple dishes like roasted baby beets, truffle fries, and short rib pastrami tacos were prepared and plated perfectly.

So, to summarize: I think we've found a favorite new neighborhood spot. We'll be back again soon!

I met an acquaintance for a drink here. We both ordered beers from the happy hour menu and shared a plate of truffle fries. I'm surprised to hear complaints about the fries because mine were perfect and delicious. The ambiance is perfect for a date and is quite charming. The bartenders were friendly and attentive. They asked a few times if we wanted more drinks without being pushy. They consistently refilled our water glasses without any prompting. Overall, my first experience here was pretty good. I'm looking forward to coming back and trying a different drink and bite to eat.

A really neat little tucked away spot for anyone looking for some tasty cocktails and great ambiance. Close to the subway station, and just a short walk from Brooklyn bridge park,  the binc is a perfect place for a couple of drinks before heading home.

Service is impeccable. When my group and I arrived we weren't sure there would be a spot for us to sit as it was a bit crowded, but they made it happen for us, which I truly appreciate.

As for drinks, take a risk and have one of the bartenders make a special concoction just for you based off of what you like... you won't regret it! These bartenders have such a knack for creativity in mixing drinks, and their attention to detail is impressive. I applaud them immensely. Plus, it's fascinating to see them create a drink for you on the spot. Wish I got the name of our bartender**edit: Richard!** as he deserves to be recognized for such a great experience at the Binc. Loved my arboreal drink, hey! Thanks again for a wonderful night!!

It's not a speakeasy - it's a bar - but the drinks they make are very, very good.  We had recently tried Le Boudoir, which was a little disappointing, so we were happy to have good drinks with more substance and balance.  And the fact they have happy hour drink list till 730 on Saturday was a pleasant surprise.

We ordered from their happy-hour drink menu ($8), and my favorite was their version of Manhattan.  And for our 2nd round, we ordered from their regular drink menu and they were all very good.

Since it's a bar, it can get too loud to have conversations since there's background music and all other noises bounce around off the hard surfaces.
And their fries are no good.  Very soft and soggy.  But the drinks?  Yay!

Visited The Binc as a party of three and shared the salmon poke, mac and cheese, artichoke hearts, baby beets, and calamari.
The five small plates were large enough to satisfy our appetite and each plate was tasty. We particularly enjoyed the artichoke hearts and the mac and cheese, especially since they removed/put the pork on the side, and we liked the happy hour cocktails, $8 each.
Definitely worth a visit if you're near Brooklyn heights/dumbo/Clinton hill/vinegar hill.

This place honestly was nothing special when it comes to the food. Had the burger and something that tasted like gnocchi and both were pretty bland tasting. Not bad but nothing to come back too. Beer was good and they had great cocktails so I'd say I would rate it a 3 for food and a 4-4.5 for drinks.

Ambiance is low-lit, low-key, swanky cocktail bar. Tables along one wall, and a wraparound marble bar. Service was quick and succinct at 8pm on a Monday, one bartender tending the whole place. I ordered a cocktail from the menu and the burger.

If you remember one thing from this review... the burger is effing AMAZING. $12. Get it before they raise the price. Medium rare. So good.

The first cocktail (High Country, some sort of hot apple cider with funky lavender flavors) was good and sightly on the boozy side. I opted for a daiquiri (not on the menu) as my second, to which the bartender happily obliged. Very balanced and just downright delicious. I'd recommend ordering a classic daiquiri if you come here on Mondays and Thursdays.

Bottom line: Impressive, sexy ambiance; good food; tasty cocktails. Need I say more?
