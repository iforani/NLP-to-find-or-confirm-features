My first experience dining out post-lockdown: Pollo D' Oro. A chicken of gold. Aptly named, as this spot has been consistently good since moving to Brooklyn 5 years ago.

Pollo a la brasa is the move, and we order in frequently, but on this fine afternoon with my girlfriend and our friends, we did sandwiches, sangria, and ceviche. The rotisserie chicken sandwich featured that aji verde (you're welcome, it's called aji verde. Don't be one of those green sauce people. It has a name and is definitely amazing enough to merit being called by its name) with mozzarella. Totally bomb.

Supplements included cheese and beef empanadas - seasoned to perfection and fried to the crispest golden brown. Ceviche was fresh and not shy with the garlic - just amazing.

Service was nicely paced and they even let our puppy sit with us outside!

Do not sleep on this spot. Support your local businesses, like PDO and be safe!

Rotisserie chicken was pretty good with their green sauce. They were generous with their extra green sauce upon request. Their sweet plantains were to die for, crispy on the edges and ripened just right where they weren't soggy. I wasn't much of a fan of their fried yuca, they were cut a little too thick and very dry and hard to bite into. Will be back to order take out again!

It's still warm enough for outdoor dining! There's plenty of seats here and [most of] the food is delish. We shared a quarter chicken with yucca as an appetizer bc we're fatties. I forgot to request the leg of the chicken but was shocked at how tasty and juicy the breast was. I've had bad experiences with yucca but theirs was fried perfectly with a light crunch outside and soft on the inside. The green sauce is a big YES. I am trying to be healthier so I ordered the salmon, which was served with a bed of green rice with onions on top. Delish and I didn't fall victim to food coma after.

Dropped a star because my husband wasn't a fan of his entree, the tacu tacu steak. The rice with the egg on top was good but the steak itself was small, really thin, dry and overcooked. We even asked the server what she recommended and she had suggested the tacu tacu! Will try something else next time.

I placed my order with YELP DELIVERY. COM.
ALL I wanted was a green salad dressing on the side,
1/4 chicken dark meat with yellow rice and beans. I should have canceled the order as soon as they called and said we are not able to deliver. Okay I will come and pick it up. Fifteen minutes later I  arrived and they still did not reduce my bill: delivery charges and tips. For what??? The service charge for trying out this online ordering I guess is nonrefundable. Fifteen minutes later I opened my order to find an overdone chicken breast and pale gummy yellow rice. The beans undercooked but the salad was acceptable. POLLO D'SASTER. NEVER AGAIN.

I came here with my friend (and his puppy) for lunch before hitting Brooklyn Bridge Park. I made a reservation the night before on Opentable, but at the time we arrived it wasn't necessary. Most tables have an umbrella over it, but the restaurant should honestly invest in some better umbrellas. Our's would not stay up properly and did not have enough weight on the bottom so it would tip over whenever the wind blew.

Order:
- Pollo Saltado (4/5)
- Tallarines Saltado w/ Chicken (4/5)

Pros:
- Good tasting food
- A lot of options to choose from
- Nice service
- They let you dine with your pets outdoor

Cons:
- Dry chicken
- Slow service ~ it took us a while to finally put our order in and get our check
- Need to invest in better umbrellas or maybe get a tent for covered outdoor dining

Overall: The food tasted great, but not the best outdoor setup

What a little gem I found ! Such a great spot for food , drinks and great music . Made reservations for 12pm on a Saturday and my party of 4 was one of two parties in the whole restaurant. I felt very safe and the staff checked my temperature and wore masks at all times . My party and I did the brunch drinks , which is mimosa or sangria for an hour and a half for $22 - Ah Ma Zing ! We had a few appetizers including the grilled octopus, la papa a la huancaina , empanadas de carne and ensalada de la casa( green house salad )  - all so good ! For entree I had the lomo saltado and it was delicious . The dessert was also amazing we did the ice cream . I would 1000% come back and recommend this spot . Service was top notch .

I stopped in here with my mom and boyfriend one really chilly Fall day in order to escape the cold. Because of this reason, I did not eat (I was not hungry) but my mom did have a cup of coffee and some tamales. I had a drink.

From my mom's comment, the coffee was good and the tamales were delicious. It's clear that this is a Peruvian restaurant, as the tamales were "Peruvian" styled. I had a cocktail and while I don't remember the name, I know it had Pisco (hellooo if I'm in a Peruvian restaurant, I am going to have a Peruvian drink lol) and it was really good. I thought the prices were reasonable for the location; it's a spot I certainly did not expect to find but I'm glad I did!

Will say kudos to this place still operating in this environment and doing a good job managing outdoor dining.

With that being said, in my mind this place is on par with Peruvian food I've had in the past, but it's nothing special. Tried the lomo saltado and a few things stood out to me:

1) A bit acidic and tomato forward. I think the sauce and dish overall could have used more salt to balance out.
2) Steak was pretty dry and there was very little of it. There was an over abundance of red onions, which provided a nice crunch but didn't add much more than texture. Could have used more cilantro  too to be honest.
3) The fries had a nice crisp but I didn't get the feeling that these were made at the restaurant. Not that they have to be but had a bit of a frozen fries feel to them.

Overall the waitress was accommodating and it's in a nice not crowded location. May not come back again but was worth trying.

I was craving something like pollo campero and as a Miamian in NYC, I naturally looked for a Peruvian restaurant and stumbled upon Pollo D'Oro in Downtown Brooklyn.
The place was decorated nicely and the ambiance was good (a lot more high end that the Peruvian restaurants I had been to in Miami, which are more casual) only complaint is that when we went the Peru - Brazil game was playing and it was extremely loud! Husband and I had to scream at each other.
Husband ordered the Lomo Saltado with fries and I ordered 1/4 of a chicken with french fries. The taste of the chicken was good but only the top skin, the inside was very bland.
Husband said his Lomo Saltado was good, although not the best he has had.
The prices were reflective of any restaurant in DB.
We had a decent experience and the menu had a lot of variety so we may come back again.

The food and drinks were just that good. We had the Tacu Tacu steak (ribeye with sweet plantains and rice and beans risotto) and the Arroz con Mariscos ( well seasoned paella with calamari, shrimp and mussels). Both dishes were delicious. The steak was the perfect medium well steak. Not too pink and it was easy the cut. The paella was flavorful rice filled with an array of seafood. I loved how they put a flower to decorate your food . This restaurant is surrounded by floor to ceiling glass. The ambiance is low key and romantic. The service was pretty prompt. The cocktails are solid here too. I had the Chiclano and it was just so perfect. It's a pisco drink with ginger liquor and more. I also had a punch which was good too. I would love to come back and try other foods and cocktails

This is the first and last time I ever order from here. I was craving papa a la huancaina and was excited to try it from Pollo d'Oro.

What I got was an absolute insult. There was almost no sauce at all and I paid $12 for this. Why would I pay $12 for a boiled potato? The kitchen should be ashamed for putting this out.

I hope management sees this and speaks with the cooks to correct the preparation so that other people don't waste their money.

Edit: I just found a black wavy hair in the food. DISGUSTING

If you're going to order dinner for a crowd and pizza isn't on the menu for whatever reason, you should give Pollo D'Oro a shot.

They call it Pollo a la Brasa. I don't know why they don't call it Pollo D'Oro, since it's definitely the specialty of the house, but all you need to know is that it's Peruvian rotisserie chicken, perfectly seasoned and available by the quarter, half, or whole. It's a great value.

Get more than you think you need, and make sure you tack on maduros and green sauce. Sure, rice and beans, tostones, and salchipapas are fine accompaniments (the salad is brought down by pale and weak tomatoes out of season), but it's all about that roast chicken. And the maduros. And the green sauce.

After our last order, against all odds I actually have some green sauce left over (I ordered extra). Although its deliciousness demands that I pour it all over whatever it is I eat next and/or rub it into my face in a sensual manner, I plan to put it in my fridge until it goes bad or I forget what it is, whichever happens first.

This is is a completely disrespectful thing to do with such an incredible sauce, but I'm just being honest here.

Because honesty is the best policy.

So I came to this restaurant with a group of 8 and we all enjoyed our time at this spot!

First off the restaurant itself is located on the corner so you get an almost 360 view of your surroundings as it's like a half circle at the corner and squared off. Also there are lovely wide glass windows for you to look out from which came in handy as that day was raining.

So our group made reservations for 6pm on a Sunday evening. Our waitress was friendly and handled our table well and didn't miss a beat. The drinks were on point as well! I tried the Peruvian kiss with its purple color was exactly what I needed. We all ordered various appetizers and main meals. I had the chicken tamales with onion and olives and tasted good! For my main course I had the Tallarines Saltado with shrimp! The shrimp tasted good but I just found the lo mein was a little dry., needed some more sauce with lo main pasta.

All in all I'm glad I tried this Peruvian restaurant!

The lunch grilled chicken sandwich is amazing! I Pair it with sweet plantains and even put it inside my sandwich to give it that sweet and savory taste! I've tried the rotisserie chicken sandwich with cheese but literally it's just bread cheese and chicken... to plain for me! Let's not forget my fave margaritaaaaaaa!!!

The causa rellena is a great appetizer and the empanadas with cheese so yummy!!!

The octopus is the perfect spice and served cold as ceviche with capers .

For dinner I get the chicken saltado! Super delicious !

I have been coming here for the past 2 years with my husband. For starters, we typically order the ceviche and beef empanadas, which is always delicious! My go-to dish is the lomo saltado, you can't go wrong with fries, rice and beef cooked with tomatoes. The food is definitely tasty, but the service could use some improvement. Also, there is a lack of AC during the summer, so it feels like a greenhouse in the restaurant, you will absolutely sweat like crazy! Despite the temperature and need for improvement in terms of service, the food is delicious and I would recommend coming here.

I've been here about 3 or 4 times. I love the food. I went again yesterday and it was empty.. there was literally 1 other person leaving when we got in. I thought they would have been a little more attentive with a group of 3. But okay.

I asked for tea, she brought be tea bags and then like 10 minutes later I had to ask for water and sugar. My boyfriend found a piece of plastic in his food. But I dont know how you're not that careful.. there wasn't any other orders.

I will be back but I expect more from this place.

Great service and good location but extremely overpriced for a very basic Peruvian restaurant. The drinks were great, food was good but not great. Unfortunately, I would not come back and wouldn't really recommend. If you are looking for something around that area, choose somewhere else to get the full experience.

Price- 1 out of 5
Food- 3 out of 5
Service- 5 out of 5
Drinks- 4 out of 5
IG worthy- 2 out of 5

Horrid ripoff.  Price gouging at its worst during this crisis.  Attempted to get drinks for myself and friends but quickly learned that a plastic cup of approx 1 pint of mojito was $52.00?!  So, we walked to the liquor store next door and bought an entire bottle of higher quality alcohol to mix ourselves for the same price, yielding about 20 drinks!  Obscene pricing.  Great food, though!

Tasty Peruvian food. Authentic. A little pricey but worth it since the quality is above average. Took mom here for a pre birthday celebration. Wish I would have tried the chicken. We ordered a jalea, lomo salteado, and salad to share. Everything was so well seasoned cooked perfectly. We were quite impressed. I had a to go order of arroz caufa for my husband. He loved his too. I tried it I love it. Solid establishment I would recommend.

To me a 3 means I got what I expected. Food, service & drink were all OK., But the employees should have better communication  with customers in what's available. They need to work on their service too, Way too slow.

Great chicken no doubt about it.
Just my concern in about the service, Hope they can fix that

I'm a fan! Friend recommended this place as a good neighborhood spot. I ordered delivery from here for the first time -- sidenote, it was literally thunderstorming out -- food came promptly / super quickly (~30min).

Mildly embarrassed reading reviews about the half chicken being perfect for 2 people... Lol. My husband and I got the whole chicken, which comes with 3 sides, as well as an extra side, and finished it ALL. In our defense, we were hungry. Pio Pio is sort of my reference for all Peruvian chicken, and I thought Pollo D'Oro was comparable. Portions were also very generous, which I wasn't expecting (which is why I ordered the whole chicken in the first place). Salchipapas was great. Fried yucca was great. Salad and rice were, well, salad and rice -- they served their purpose. Green sauce was yummy, but probably not THE best green sauce I've had. Overall, very, very satisfying, especially given it's delivery and even more so if it's raining cats and dogs out.

We order from here at least 3-4 times a month and it's consistently good. For two people, the half chicken (which comes with two sides) is the perfect amount of food. We always get the rice and beans and the fried yucca - although, I have had to start ordering an extra side of fried yucca because we always end up fighting over the last pieces!

The chicken is so flavorful and always moist/juicy. It does take a bit of time to prepare so be ready to wait around 15-20 minutes. The empanadas here are also great - we order them when we're in a rush and just need a "grab and go" snack.

There's sometimes live music which makes for a lively atmosphere. Hoping to try some other items on the menu but we just can't stop ordering the chicken!

I've eaten at the restaurant many times before and have successfully ordered delivery too... but this is the first time that I cannot believe their delivery service was so poor as was their reaction. I waited over an hour for my food... 30 minutes past the arrival time. I asked the guy what took so long and he said the restaurant sent him to two addresses on opposite sides of town. Worse, the food showed up in a broken bag with the containers smashed, tostones all over the bottom of the bag where the open holes were and it looks like the delivery guy might have shoved the fallen food back in and tied a knot (how unsanitary and scary with Covid!!!). In calling the restaurant just now to have them replace the food -- they basically said refund only because they're too busy to deliver the food that they messed up unless I'm willing to wait yet another hour! So now I'm left hungry and with a really bitter taste in my mouth over this experience and restaurant.

Great! Food was delicious, I ordered the Tallarines Saltado with shrimp, and the portion size was just right! Great flavor and beautiful presentation. The mixed drinks were okay, and I would probably not order again, but I would definitely come back to this cute restaurant again. Parking is fairly difficult to find, though.

This place exceeded my expectations. We came after church on Sunday and were able to walk right in and grab a table. They were serving a brunch menu and both my fiancé' and I enjoyed our dish. The sweet potatoes were particularly good. I would definitely come back again.

Don't come here u less you have ample time to spend waiting for your food. Came here for lunch and it took us a very long time to order and get our food. That is on down side of this place. On the up side the food is delicious and the portions are generous. The food is fresh and flavorful. Had the ceviche and fried seafood platter and it was absolutely delicious.

This place has been saved on my bookmark for about a year and after taking pictures for a friend we were trying to figure out where to eat around the area. I suggested Pollo D' Oro & I'm glad we did. Everything from the appetizer to the dessert was delicious! For our appetizer we had cheese empanadas w/ a green sauce I think it was aji verde. Whatever sauce it was, it was delicious & I enjoyed it very well with my empanada which was really yummy as well.

For our entrees we both had Peruvian style pasta. I got the Tallarines Saltado ( stir fried Peruvian Lo Mein) and my friend had the Tallarines Verdes (Peruvian style pesto pasta). For dessert we shared a tres leche which was moist and soft. Overall I loved this place and will definitely be coming back to try more food.

I ordered the quarter chicken (with green sauce) and sweet plantains on the evening of 12/17*. It was tasty, however, I woke up with the worst food poisoning the next morning and assume it was from eating the food at this restaurant. 5 stars for flavor but 0 stars for food quality.

The food is amazing!!! So glad I found this spot, because it's like a hidden gem, making it one of my favorite restaurants in NYC. 10/10 would definitely recommend going here!!

This is one of my go-to Peruvian places-- I first came here last year and was delighted by how good it is. Since then, I've kept coming back as a neighbourhood favourite. The prices seem expensive but all their dishes are sharable and is more than enough for a group. Every time I come I try something new and each time I am happy!!!!!!!!! The ambiance is nice, the service is great, love love love. The only thing I would note is that the food can take a bit longer than usual to come so plan for that.

Usually I get a quarter chicken and then try one of their specialties. If you want some ideas for what to order, you can't go wrong with the Lomo Saltado but my personal favourite is the lamb shank. The sauce is UNREAL. Also get all the sides -- you won't leave hungry!

Rice and beans were bland. Fried plantains was soaked in oil which means they were doubled fried after being flatten, also and for your info NYC dogs are allowed for out dining.

Highly recommended

This is the perfect place to grab dinner in a nice part of Brooklyn that is not inundated with a lot of tourists.

The variety of different pisco sour cocktails were very delicious; my favorite was the Purivian Kiss. Although the drinks are made in a particular manner, out waitresses was very accommodating in modifying my drink requests (as I am not a huge fan of super sweet drinks). The drinks are $12+, but there is a happy hour special until 7PM.

The food was just ok. I had the salmon and shrimp special (I forget what it was called), which was suggested by the waitress because my other option was not available. The salmon was cooked nicely (although it was a bit under-seasoned) but the sauce had a weird texture and it already had that "pudding skin" before it was brought to the table. Although the salmon was a bit of a miss, the traditional ceviche made up for it

The picarones were excellent - probably some of the best that I have eaten in NYC. Unfortunately, the sponge cake was not up to par, because it did not have much of a taste and it was really dry.

The servers were very friendly and attentive, although we had to actively flag down a waitress a few times. I cut them some slack, because we visited during a busy Friday night.

I definitely recommend this place is you are in the downtown Brooklyn area and have a craving for Peruvian, but I do not think the the food is that great to travel from multiple boroughs. That said, I could see myself coming back mostly for the bebidas and a quick ceviche.

Great food and great service! Reasonable prices for amazing Peruvian food and the service makes it even better! I got the Jalea, my cousin got the steak meal and we split the steak empanadas. I was sick so I couldn't have any alcohol! The prices here are good, the portions are great and the presentation better. If I wasn't so full I would've gotten dessert! Will have to come back for that! I will definitely come back and bring my boyfriend with me!

I only had appetizers here but it's above the standard Peruvian joint.

We came after a festival and looked like we came from a festival and the staff was accommodating and warm. The food presentation is amazing (creative and colorful) and the good tastes great. Will come back if I'm in the area.
