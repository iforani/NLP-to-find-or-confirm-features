POST COVID REVIEW:

This place was fantastic! We made a reservation for Friday night and our table was ready when we arrived at the restaurant. The entire staff was wearing masks and everyone dining in the outdoor patio was safely distanced from one another.

Their menu has shortened due to COVID and was brought out on a lovely black board. We ended up ordering focaccia for the table, the sirloin burger, and the hanger steak. Everything was exceptional. The meat was cooked exactly how we ordered and was flavored and seasoned to perfection. And those potatoes...YUM! The food was also beautifully plated.

I will definitely be returning to try out their pasta and seafood! Check them out!!

My friend and I came here for outdoor seating during Covid. Their outdoor garden has a nice ambiance and seating was well spaced out. They have hand sanitizer available as you walk in to enter the garden. They even put something under the tables to ward off bugs at night. The restroom was also clean and easy to access.

The food was really good. We shared the Bacchus salad as an appetizer which was fresh and loaded with different types of fruit. For our entrees, we both ordered the Black Angus Ribeye which was quite tasty and a good portion...neither of us were able to finish it and took the rest for leftovers. They also have a good wine list and we were happy with the bottle of wine they recommended for us.

My only complaint was that service was a bit slow and not as attentive as I would have liked (we had to wave down the waiter a few times), so I wouldn't recommend coming here if you are rushing to do something afterwards. But I would definitely recommend it for it's outdoor seating and delicious food.

Bacchus Bistro was heaven on earth! Meryl was so flexible and reliable. We definitely could not have had a our beautiful wedding without her! We originally had a contract for September 2020 but due to covid we contacted Meryl and asked to have our date changed to July 2020. It was literally 2 weeks before our wedding and Meryl and the team were so open and willing to work with us, we were set for our dinner. Then just 1 week before our wedding, we called for yet another adjustment, we needed to actually host our full ceremony at Bacchus due to the rain. Little questions asked, it was set and our wedding was perfect. Meryl and the team were flexible and assured we were able to practice social distancing and staying safe. On the day of our wedding, it was pouring rain with thunder and lighting and the show went on! The team added covers to the back garden to block the rain. Meryl was attentive and made sure we had everything we needed from food to wine to cutting our cake and providing to-go cake boxes. Ugh! We could not be more grateful for Meryl and the Team at Bacchus Bistro. We can't wait to go back for our Anniversary dinner!

I took a friend to Bacchus for a fancy birthday meal, and felt really guilty, because it was just as much of a gift to myself as it was to my friend. Bacchus is definitely now one of my favorite restaurants in Brooklyn!

The food here is incredible - the menu changes every week, but it's safe to assume that delicious, hearty, seasonal dishes will be waiting to fill you up. We shared a ribeye that was cooked to perfection. Medium rare actually meant medium rare, and the flavor was spot on.

Bacchus is definitely worth splurging for a nice night out or a special occasion!

We came to dinner here one fine Friday evening and had such a fantastic time. Our server was very friendly and made great conversation within a few minutes of being there.

The service was phenomenal, drinks were brought out minutes after they were ordered. The food did not take long to come out from the kitchen. Although I didn't get photos of everything the one thing I did get of a photo of was very delicious!

I would highly recommend coming here for date night or a cute dinner with the girls.

When was the last time you had the option to order a Methuselah sized bottle of wine with dinner? Maybe it's more common than I realize, but this was a first for me. Still, if I had to choose between ordering one of their better ones versus filling my house's tank with heating oil...

I can't decide if I want to describe this place as having food fancier than atmosphere, or atmosphere more casual than the food. And I don't mean that as negatives, I enjoyed the combination, and service that was attentive and yet equally casual and familiar.

I liked that certain menu options came in a variety of choices, such as appetizers vs. entrees vs. small plates. And by that I mean DUCK, specifically the duck leg confit this time. The combination of the crispy exterior with the tender meat was pleasing to the palate. I combined that with a special for the evening, a salad featuring roasted beets, and I dined very well. We did go for a much more modest bottle of wine to go with our dinner, but we were completely satisfied with it, and I have a feeling that the wines in general pair well with meals here, despite my lack familiarity with most of them.

It does get a bit crowded and loud here, which relates to my opinion of the casual nature here. Don't let that make you uncomfortable, enjoy the food and drink here.

1/8/2020Bill, I'm glad to hear that overall you enjoyed the food, service and atmosphere when you came by! Thank you for taking a few minutes to share your honest opinions. I appreciate hearing from you! By the way, our largest bottle is a Melchoir (18Liters), like a few very large formats, they are on a different wine list! Hope to have you back for another great meal in the future.

They're really a 4.5, but I'm rounding up because I had a consistently pleasant culinary experience more than once.

The first time, I was in a the backyard area which is dressed up for nice little gatherings. The food was provided by Bacchus and it was great!

That was what brought me back to Bacchus for the regular dining menu this time. And I was not disappointed! (it was pricey though).

I ordered the big meat special because why wouldn't I? You get different cuts of beef, chicken and duck! It was so big that we couldn't finish it. We also ordered the sauce flight, which was nice but I might not do again. I'm not sure I'm a big enough fan of mushroom based sauces.

One time I visited this place, a cool and trendy French employee accidentally knocked my half eaten dinner plate on the floor. I cried hungry tears, but he immediately apologised, put in a new order for me, and gave me a GIANT serving of my same meal. I was too full and was going to ask for the check, but his act was so kind! I still asked them to wrap it up and happily had the meal the next day. The service here is fantastic, the food is delicious, and the atmosphere is excellent! I have been here so many times and never get tired. The outdoor space is beautiful for events (birthdays and weddings), but also for just dodging the summer sun beating down on you. I love this place!

I came here for my cousin's bridal shower so there was a pre fix menu. First off, it's a lovely venue if you're wanting to host an event. There was a baby shower happening right next to us but weren't bothered by them at all.

The food all in all was absolutely delicious. I seriously do not have anything negative to say about any of the dishes I received.

Crab cake was full of crab meat and really good.

The hanger steak is making me drool just by writing this.

The creme brûlée as you would expect. Perfect.

I'd definitely come back again to try the rest of the menu.

Had a nice experience with our server(two starts goes to him), but unfortunately not really pleased by management. Absolutely rude and not capable of talking to the customers in the right way. No hi - no bye.
Don't think we will be back.
Unfortunately, because wine was pretty good.

I hate croque madames (mesdames?). And then I met your croque madame. Bread was perfection, the egg was cooked exactly as I asked for it to be cooked, the potatoes that came with it were nicely firm (not soggy and not dry).

I'm making a list of places I will go just to sit there once this is over. I will definitely see you.

5 Stars for a dimly-lit, romantic French restaurant that serves up quality dishes and makes you want to throw a beautiful party out back.

Damn. This place is romantic! I had the chance to stop by recently (thanks to the stellar reviews) and we were sat very quickly near the back glass doors. It was chilly out, but warm and romantically-lit inside.

The atmosphere inside is top notch, but while we were there we caught glimpses of the outside back area and could just imagine how magical it would be in the right weather.

Beyond atmosphere, the food and drinks were on-point. I ordered a red wine and described my preferences to the knowledgeable server who made a selection for me that didn't disappoint.

The bread they bring is warm and addictive, but save it for the mussels!

We ordered the following:
Root Vegetables Salad- roasts beets, turnips, pistachios, goat cheese, frisée salad, mustard dressing, and balsamic glaze. This was a fresh, light entry into our main dishes.

Mussel and French Fries- holy white wine broth, Batman! I was thankful I'd held on to some of that bread to soak up that sauce. This was a lot less expensive than it could have been. And at $19, it's worth it even as a starter.

Homemade Purple Potato Gnocchi- light as a feather! Gosh, I hate dense gnocchi, but this was made with love.

Overall, a solid date night spot to which I would absolutely return!

My wife and I came here for an anniversary brunch. We ordered the bottomless mimosas + main option for $30. I had the crabcake benedict and she had the chicken salad sandwich. Both were excellent, and I wouldn't hesitate to order anything off the menu. The coffee and cocktails were great, as were the creme brûlée and chocolate mousse we had for dessert. The atmosphere was intimate but lively, with rustic French decor and many other brunch groups enjoying their morning as much as us

What was best about our experience was the service. Blanca was kind, friendly, and attentive. She would refill our drinks before we had finished them, and she checked in regularly without being overbearing. Some of the best service I've ever received at any restaurant. Can't say enough. Please come and visit.

Impressive outdoor seating! The tables are well spaced apart and they show you a large menu sign instead of handing out menus. There's even a shortcut to the bathroom from the back so you don't have to walk in to the restaurant to access it. Service was prompt and food was good! I ordered the foie gras to start, salmon for the main course and chocolate lava cake for dessert. The foie gras was good but the chestnut puree and date made the dish a little heavy. Would've preferred a fruit preserve or onion jam instead. The salmon was delicious - served medium rare on beet mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts with a lemon caper sauce. I would order this again. The dessert was subpar. I've had better chocolate lava cake, but I do appreciate that the center was oozing! My husband had the ribeye steak with roasted crispy potatoes, mushrooms and a creamy peppercorn sauce. I was salivating the entire time. Would love to come back and try more dishes!

Came for brunch and we were able to be seated right away without having reservations. Cute spot, but the food was lackluster. The burger was bland and needed seasoning and the potatoes were also mediocre. I'd skip this place for food but come for the wine selection.

If you're ever inclined to come by for some wine and perhaps try something else on the menu, I'd love to welcome you back.

Have a great rest of your week,

The Albaro manager was super rude. That was my girlfriend's birthday and we had a party of 7ppl. My girlfriend and I showed up on time and the "manager" said: "your table will be ready in 4-5 mins." After 30 mins waiting outside we asked him again about our table and he cursed us that our company is not here anyway. I could understand if he at least leted us know the situation and canceled the reservation. I told  him we have made this reservation a week ago and the restaurant has my credit card to guarantee the reservation, he started yelling at me at the middle of the restaurant and just walked away. The worst experience ever not talking about the mood and atmosphere in general. The whole evening has been spoiled. And I don't care about how "cool" this place, it's unacceptable.  Will never go there away and I, personally, make sure none of my friends or clients go there ever. Good luck with business. And if you want a shity service,  that's the place to go to.

10/10/2020Hi Maksiim,

I have already answer to your girlfriend, so I am just going to copy the same answer to you.

I am happy to see you enjoyed your food, both the branzino and the hanger steak and Alpi, your server.
My manager Alvaro, who works with me for the past 12 years, and have an outstanding reputation with our customers, just applied our reservation policy.
You had a reservation on Saturday night for 7 people at 7pm. Two of you arrived at 7:20pm and the rest of your party at 8:00pm. You blocked 8 covers, for one hour, on Saturday night, in a restaurant with limited space due to Covid 19 rules and regulations. Our outdoor capacity is not even 30% of what we have usually. Instead of being upset against Alvaro, you should have thanks him for keeping your table during all this time.
He couldn't served you any drinks, because no alcohol can be served without food, all patrons know that now.

In such a difficult time, we need from our customers to understand the importance of being on time when they make a reservation.
We hope to see you back soon at Bacchus.

Best regards,
Bruno Laclide

3/16/2020Good evening Karen,
I am sorry to hear you didn't stay yesterday night. The dining room is a nice area that people love. Blanca seat you over there because the wine bar and the bistro were full. We had two waiters and one sommelier/waiter working yesterday night. More than 60 people came in less than 30 minutes with one lady in wheel chair we didn't know about. We had to change the entire set-up for the party of 15 she was part of.
We did our best but I understand your frustration but understand also this is sometime not a problem we generated but others and we always try our best and be helpful. I really hope you will try us again because our regulars love us for what I just explained before, and we would love to impress you the next time.
Thank you for sharing your feelings.
Best regards,
Bruno

Went here for a friends wedding. First of all the back outdoor area is beautiful! We got very lucky with the weather and everything was just perfect! The food was terrific! They had a prefix menu for the event. I got the crab cake, pasta with shrimp and creme brûlée for dessert. Everything was just delicious! They were serving a white wine for the table which was great as well! The service was very good! Will be back here for dinner!

We enjoyed a New Year's Eve dinner at this cozy restaurant. The wine choices are infinite and impressive . All the courses were presented so pleasing to the eye as well as taste. Our waiter was very enthusiastic & determined to find a wine taste to suit our son which he successfully did. We got an early reservation and we were not rushed to finish . The restaurant grew more crowded but we were able to enjoy each course and drinks with relaxation. My husband enjoyed a couple of generous glasses of beer as we loved our wine . They topped most of the presentations with beautiful edible flowers, all portions were just right and to add to the final touch the desserts were just perfect! We would definitely be back for a date night if we are in the area or special celebration. So glad we had our New Years Eve dinner here!

Been here twice, once for a small intimate wedding and the second time for my mother's birthday. The courses at the wedding were delicious so we decided to give the restaurant another try for a special occasion. Overall, we enjoyed the food although there were some misses. Service was friendly and attentive.

We tried the Foie Gras Torchon, Snails, and Salmon & Avocado Tartar for appetizers. We also ordered the Mussels in Mariniere (white wine, shallots and garlic broth) & French Fries to share. Appetizers were excellent and we enjoyed them more than our entrees.

For entrees, I ordered the Short Ribs Pot-au-Feu, but didn't really enjoy the meat; it was too chewy and fatty for me. I ended up eating the vegetables and sharing the meat with everyone else. My husband had the White Wine Veal Osso-Bucco, which he hated; the meat was dry and tasteless. My brother had the Red Wine Braised Lamb Shank, which he said was decent. His girlfriend had the Roasted 1/2 Chicken. My mother enjoyed the Black Angus Hanger Steak. My father had the 14oz Black Angus Rib Eye Steak, which we agreed was the best entree of our table; it was perfectly cooked and tender.

For dessert, we ordered the molten lava cake, the chocolate mousse cake, and the creme brulee to share. They added a birthday candle to the cake for my mother and kindly gave us a slice of pumpkin pie on the house. While some of the entrees were disappointing, the appetizers and dessert were great. Atmosphere was cozy and inviting on our rainy evening.

First time going to this place and I must say I was delighted. We decided to have our daughters 1st birthday dinner here cause of the amazing backyard seating they have available. We also brought a high chair in to decorate for her and the staff helped us with tape and whatever we needed to decorate and make our babies night special. Ended up ordering the hanger steak with potatoes and mushrooms with the peppercorn sauce to die for. Food was delicious. Plating was nice and neat. Service was quality. Would recommend. Thank you for having us

Came for brunch with a group of 5, and they let us wait to start the bottomless drinks until we all got there. The service was eh, seems like the waiter didn't know much English. However, the music, the food, the drinks were all amazing. Seriously, I'm having dreams about these potatoes! I will definitely be back here!

I want to put 2 stars for food (branzino and hanger stakes were delicious) and for our server who was very nice. Here is my story though. I had a reservations on Saturday night for 7 people which I made a week in advance and called twice to confirm it. When me and my husband showed up at 7 we were told by Alberto ( I might be mistaken with a name) that our table will be ready in 5 minutes so we waited for half an hour outside nobody explained us what's going on. When I went to ask if we can be seated Alberto said we can't because our party was not complete. Then I went to ask again and he got so defensive like if he was doing me a favor and really rude, he said he won't give us a table if we won't stop asking him questions. I completely understand that half of my party was late, and if they would refuse to seat us for that reason it would be fare too, but there are so many ways to explain things to customers if u call yourself a manager. He could give us a timeframe or we could start offering drinks or something. Instead I got yelled at on my birthday party by an employee. On the top of that he never apologized or even said bye when we were leaving. I've never got treated like this in the restaurant not even in a coffee shop. Unfortunately

10/1/2020Good evening Valeriia,

I am happy to see you enjoyed your food, both the branzino and the hanger steak and Alpi, your server.
My manager Alvaro, who works with me for the past 12 years, and have an outstanding reputation with our customers, just applied our reservation policy.
You had a reservation on Saturday night for 7 people at 7pm. Two of you arrived at 7:20pm and the rest of your party at 8:00pm. You blocked 8 covers, for one hour, on Saturday night, in a restaurant with limited space due to Covid 19 rules and regulations. Our outdoor capacity is not even 30% of what we have usually. Instead of being upset against Alvaro, you should have thanks him for keeping your table during all this time.
He couldn't served you any drinks, because no alcohol can be served without food, all patrons know that now.

In such a difficult time, we need from our customers to understand the importance of being on time when they make a reservation.
We hope to see you back soon at Bacchus.

Best regards,
Bruno

I just held my bridal shower at Bacchus this past weekend, on Saturday. I want to extend a big, big THANK YOU to Meryl and her team for the wonderful experience my guests and I had. Everyone is still raving about how delicious the food was. The service was perfect and the staff were very accommodating for our event.
My decorator and some of my friends were able to come before the restaurant even opened to set up. Everything was perfectly timed out (with the passed hors d'oeuvres, appetizers, entrees, and dessert), even with some of my guests arriving a bit late. (I warned people about parking being tough and to even avoid driving if possible.) Someone was always checking in with me about when I want the next dish brought out, how much time to wait in between courses, when to cut the cake, etc.

I had previously been to Bacchus two years ago for a friend's wedding and loved the food and outdoor garden space.
I decided to host my bridal shower here and was so fortunate for the beautiful weather, as the garden was just the perfect area. There is a covering overhead with blinds that can be drawn down to cover from the sun. I loved the ambience of the garden space already, and my decorations looked great within it.
I opted for the 4 hours open bar including mimosas, wine, champagne, beer, coffee, tea, and soft drinks. I also pre-selected two appetizers, four entrees, and two desserts for guests to choose from. I chose to print my own menu to match the theme of my party. I was allowed to bring in my own cake and have a dessert table set up by an outside vendor.
Everything was coordinated prior to my event. I informed Meryl how many tables I would need (for guests and other displays including photo props, favors, etc.), sent over my Spotify playlist, and confirmed the menu. Everything went smoothly and the time flew by! Everyone greatly enjoyed themselves and is still talking about the wonderful party!
Once again, thank you so much!! I will definitely be back !! :)

Bacchus is a wonderful little restaurant nestled in downtown Brooklyn. The atmosphere was inviting as well as the staff. Even with several events going on, the staff was alert and attentive.

The drinks and the food were absolutely delicious! From the plating down to the very last bite- excellent!

Totally recommend and definitely coming back!

I don't think I ever had such a wonderful experience, I'm talking from the minute you walk in to the door the stuff is super friendly, they definitely make you feel welcome and that's just once you step a foot into this place , but let's talk about the restaurant as a restaurant

I know for a fact that the service in this place is by far one of the best ones I've ever had in my life and trust me I like to eat so I know more than a few places in NY but specially in Brooklyn this place doesn't get the recognition it deserves, our waiter was Fausto I think that was his name , honestly that night I didn't know what to eat and this guy gave me some options I decided to go with the octopus ragout as and appetizer and it was lovely , so obviously the waiter knew what he was talking about so I ask him for more suggestions and long history short I end up having pan seared scallops and foie grass , than I wanted to try more things because everything I had was so delightful so he suggested the venison parpadelle and my date loved it , so we ask him again and he told us their steak selection was amazing and obviously at this point we just wanted more so my date had the hanger steak and I had the rib eye steak and it was right than and there me and her decided this was going to be our place to go to for date night and by the way at their wine selection is pretty impressive I wish I knew the brand of the Sauvignon blanc or the Chardonnay because I definitely wanna have that at home

If it had the option to give them ten stars i would've done it with out a question  I wish I had more pictures but we were so busy having fun we just didn't care for our phones

As someone who loves to indulge in wine & charcuterie, Bacchus was love at first sight. The steak was absolutely amazing and their wine list is very extensive. The ambiance is really nice, but still very inviting. As someone who is relatively new to meats and cheese it was refreshing that they have a professional sommelier working there to help guide me through the menu . Overall I was very happy with my experience I will definitely be coming back

Delicious brunch place. We live in the neighborhood and decided to try this restaurant out. Service was prompt coffee was good, menu was diverse and the food was good. I got the French toast, which came with strawberries. My husband got the quiche Lorraine and the salad. They also offer a bottomless mimosa and Bellini special, which we did not partake in. Would 100% come back and bring friends. There's a lovely outdoor garden and some private rooms for larger parties.

I've known about Bacchus for years, and I finally tried it recently. Bacchus is a wine bar with a restaurant on the other side. The restaurant has a bar as well. If you like French wine this is the place to drink it, and eat good food. The wine list features many excellent wines, and they are all fairly priced. A Glass of 2015 Chateau Clos du Roy was only $15. The kitchen is solid as well. I tried the Octopus with white bean ragout as an appetizer. It was tender and tasty, but I thought that the portion was a bit small. My entree was the Rib-Eye Steak. A fourteen ounce steak that was tender and delicious, the potato's that were on the dish were delicious also. I opted for the Red Wine Shallot sauce, and it was very tasty. The negatives are:  The house bread was chewy, the Burre Blanc was tasteless, and the mushrooms included with the Steak were tough. I will go back.

Came here for the first time the other night and loved the ambiance, service, and food. The wine selection is extensive and the food was delicious. The meat plate is divine! Back again tonight for another dinner and disappointed by the music. Much too high energy pop music for such a romantic bistro setting.

Was able to book a two-person reservation here last minute on a Tuesday evening. Intimate atmosphere with dim lighting and cozy seating.

Menu is on the expensive end since it's more of a romantic dinner spot. Despite that, many of the entrees were enticing enough to order. Settled on the Atlantic Salmon ($22) and a glass of Bordeaux ($9). While waiting, got served free bread and butter to start. Bread was decent, a little tough on the outside - fine with the butter (and wine). Main course was smaller than expected; a large plate with a petite filet covering the lentils/veggies underneath. Fish is cooked well, and the horseradish sauce really brings out the flavor of the meal. Ate it all pretty fast, though wasn't stuffed afterwards.

Service here is good considering a couple large groups who took most of the attention. Like the ambiance here for dinner, though prices are considerably cheaper for lunch and brunch.

A five star review and I didn't even have any wine at this wine bistro!

I was recommended here by a friend who is a brunch enthusiast.

At first glance, the menu was disappointing because I didn't see the crab cake Benedict that was mentioned on some yelp reviews. The hostess explained to me that the menu items are rotated every few months :0

The menu may not have many options but the food and presentation were amazing. For $11, I got an impressive French toast dish called PAIN PERDU CROUSTILLANT, which is described as a Corn flakes crusted French toast with Grand Marnier Sabayon. It was huge! The bread was a soft baguette, unlike the usually thick sliced bread most places use. The sauce is a very sweet, thick custard flavored with vanilla, Marsala wine and Grand Marnier.

The waiters were very attentive and the restaurant has great ambience as well. The noise level is perfect for carrying on a conversation.

Meryl and her team are quite professional and they really helped make our wedding unforgettable.  Food was absolutely delicious -we heard all about it from the comments we received from our attendees. Our guests were of many different nationality (and sense of taste) but it seems they were all satisfied.

Meryl considered our budget and was able to understand what our vision was for our special day. On the day of the wedding, the team helped to decorate. We brought our own large photo frames and they hanged it nicely without us asking to do so.

They also provided a tripod easel to hold one of our frame for our polaroid films when we forgot to bring one. Meryl nicely sprinkled flower pedals for the ceremony at the right time.  She was of great help to the entire logistics during the ceremony.

When we had some leftover wedding cake, the team- unprompted- cut the rest and packed it up for guests to take it back home.  We thought it was a thoughtful gesture.

Compared to other venues we approached, Meryl and the rest of the Bacchus staff are super flexible and very detail oriented.  If you care about wine and food and If you want the intimate yet fun and a beautiful Brooklyn wedding, this is the perfect venue.

Needless to say, I wholeheartedly recommend dining here even without a wedding!

So I went here on a Valentine's Date with my partner. We looked at the menu online prior to the visitation so we already had an idea of what we will get and how much money we will spend. So when we got there, turns out they have a special Valentine's menu. We politely asked for their regular menu but they declined. Guess they wanted us to spend more money than planned. The lobster soup sucked, the oysters sucked, the lamb chops were the only good thing we ate. Not to mention we kept getting stared at. As if they never seen black people at a French restaurant before. So we payed $200 just to starve and be stared at. Won't be coming back here.

2/28/2020Shenia, I'm sorry to hear that you weren't a fan of our Valentine's Day menu. Please know it is very common for nice restaurants to do a set menu for special holidays an events as it allows for our team of chefs to concentrate on making something extra special and new. That said, it's unfortunate to hear that you and your partner weren't a fan. If you have any additional questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to us directly. We'd love to welcome you back to try out our regular menu anytime.

Sincerely,
Bruno Laclide

Bacchus checks off all boxes -- ambiance, food and service.

Ambiance: The private backyard event space at Bacchus is so dreamy and is the perfect location for a summer dinner party! Think lots of hanging string lights, greenery and lose drapes hanging from the ceiling. The ceiling is also shuttered which makes this a very versatile space. There were around 50-60 people in the group and the private event space held everyone very comfortably.

Food: Everything that I ate was damn delicious. To start, I had butternut squash ravioli. This was sweet, savory and just downright amazing. For my main I went with the half roasted chicken served with mashed potatoes and veggies. I asked for the truffle mushroom sauce on the side and am glad I did. Delicious but a little too rich for my blood. The chicken was perfectly crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. Others at the table had salmon and beef and really enjoyed. Dessert was the only course that was not my favorite. I had the creme brûlée and it was a little bit overheated and watery. But... to make up for that I ate my friend's chocolate molten cake and this was insanely good.

Service: Handled the large dinner party like pros. We were joking about how no one had less than a half a glass of wine the entire night. Any time a glass looked empty the servers came around and filled the wine up to the top.

Parts of the restaurant are cozy and intimate while the backyard is great for a large party, which makes Bacchus the perfect pick for a date night or an event.

Upon entering , I was welcomed by one of the nicest staff I've across in a while. Both Sophia and Fausto were really amazing - suggested a few dishes and were very informative with the menu.Fausto poured a very tasteful glass of wine and I thoroughly enjoyed everything. Started wth French onion soup and finished with the chicken breast with mashed potatoes and asparagus.

Will definitely be returning and would love to bring the rest of the nypd crew with me sometime soon for dinner . Thank you
