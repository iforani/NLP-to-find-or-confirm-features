Diverse menu and unique drinks. The brunch items are large quantities and decent prices. The French toast was out of this world, the eggs were okay (I think my tomatoes were canned). Came during COVID, and was able to sit outside due to nice weather. You also have a nice view of the water if you sit outside. Our service was okay, would come again for the pizza!!

Industry Kitchen is a great place to come to during COVID. It's the perfect place for outdoor seating, drinks and views. Last night I shared a margarita pizza and garlic fries with a friend. They were both good, like average. I live in the neighborhood and I would go back for the ambience and setting more so than the food. Our waitress was really nice and honored the one beer because it was the last one.

Good location with a river view to meet a friend in New York City.

The location is close to ferries and trains. Although it's situated in an old part of town that evokes Melville's Bartleby, the Scrivener, Industry Kitchen has a modern, fun, airy feel.

The menu includes salads, nonconformist pizzas, vegetable sides, and larger entrees featuring salmon and steak. Vegetarians and meat-eaters should find options. There is also a unique list of cocktails plus a full bar.

I was happy with the Burrata al Tartufo ($23
Gruyère, baby arugula, toasted almonds, truffle shavings, Himalayan sea salt) and Pot of Mussels ($19 shallots, butter, garlic, white wine, cilantro; herbed focaccia), splitting both with one friend.

Staff is friendly and professional. Checks in on you at all the right moments.

Covid or not, Industry Kitchen was MADE for outside dining.

Great food and excellent waterfront location near Wall St / Pier 11 Ferry.  You can tell the proprietors haven't sold their soul and still care deeply about quality and service staff- because it comes across in all the touch-points.

The hanger steak is great quality steak and at a price point ($26) that makes it an easy choice for a weeknight out.  The pot of mussels has a wine garlic sauce that is on the perfect border of light and rich, dancing between the two with each bite.  Downeast Unfiltered Cider wasn't on the menu, but when asked, we learned that it was in fact available- score!

Had an absolutely delightful evening from start to finish- helped by a beautiful sunset along the East River.  Definitely bringing friends back again.

This place gets 3 stars for the glass tents and being on the East river. We as a group of 8 so we were able to be seated in two tents at 6 pm. They don't have any seasonal drinks and cocktail list is basic. We ordered appetizers which were not good. The other table has pizzas which they seemed to enjoy but not great.

Service was great.
COVID-19 precautions great
Igloo tents great
Food not impressed

This was the first time I've been out to eat in the city since March and it was just really nice.  The view of the water made the outdoor eating experience enjoyable.
We ordered the seasonal dips as an appetizer and that might have been the best part of my meal. Not because the food wasn't good, but because the dips were THAT good. I kept finding myself going back to them throughout the meal (and even dipping my pizza crusts into them!).
For the main meal we ordered the margarita pizza.  It was good.  Nothing over the top special. But still very good.

Overall I really loved being able to go out to eat and Industry Kitchen didn't disappoint!

Came here with a few friends for their outdoor dining and was not all that impressed (3.5/5). Pretty average spot but maybe part of the experience was missed coming at night when it was dark and the water view wasn't that great.

Ordered the seasonal dips for appetizer (not pictured) which was just fine. For main we got the diablo pizza and the burrata al tartufo pizzas. I think the diablo pizza was interesting and more memorable with the spicy cheesy crust used and who doesn't like chorizo, cheese, peppers and heat, and aioli?? The burrata was alright, but didn't really care for it one way or another. Same thoughts on the dessert - chocolate river. It was not bad, but not sure if worth ordering out here.

This is a really chill outdoor restaurant on the water at the FDR.
The pizza is good. If do not eat meat be careful with menu because you may miss it given the Italian language.
Service  and seating does not take long.
They have some covered seating areas which will be helpful as it gets colder. But I think some warmers will be needed.

Industry Kitchen is a fantastic outdoor dining option right now. Great drinks, bites, and view of the water.

I made a reservation for 6 on my bday and the table was ready to go when I arrived. There was plenty of room on the long tables and attentive service.

My table got a few orders of the Diablo pizza and the potato curls. The Diablo pizza is excellent - interesting and tasty. It's not too spicy if that's of concern. The potato curls were okay - not crispy enough.

Cocktails we're all good, but on the sweet side. Also have a solid beer and wine menu.

Great location in the South Street Seaport area! Very scenic view of Brooklyn, and there's a generous amount of tables (all socially distanced, or course). Came here for dinner with my boyfriend and we were seated immediately upon arrival (we had reservations). We were slightly worried about rain, but a good amount of the tables are under an alcove, and the others have umbrellas. Still wouldn't recommend coming during a downpour, but light rain isn't a huge deal at this place!

We decided to share the Bianca pizza, and I had the truffle tagliatelle for my entree (without salami). It was a great casual meal - the ricotta on the pizza was to die for, and I love all truffle pastas (adult Mac and cheese, as I often call them)! Service was friendly and quick, even though the restaurant was relatively busy. All in all, a great experience - would be interested in coming back to try their brunch, as well!

The views are amazing , and perfect for a date , birthday or just an after work dinner.
The burrata pizza was so goood ! The steak was very well seasoned and made to perfections , the chips/fries it came with were so deliciously well, and whatever garlic sauce they added to the side was delicious
The Cali flower with beets appetizer, was really good too, definitely worth getting to try , interesting blend of flavors

Socially distanced outdoor eating. Also saw the enclosed seating they will used when it gets cold out. Loved the avocado toast and wild omelette. They didn't rush us at all so we enjoyed the outdoor space and view for a while. Support local businesses!

This is a great fair-weather location situated right on the water's edge in Manhattan just south of south street seaport.

Perfect for lunch or dinner, they've got plenty of outside seating and their normal menu which has delicious pizzas as well as a good number of food options for those who wants lots of veggies. The salmon filet comes seated on a plate of purple potatoes that are pretty amazing. I also had the burrata pizza and it was delectable. I strongly recommend going and savoring the food, ambiance, polite and attentive service, and view while the summer weather is here and while outdoor seating is the only option. Once you're able to sit indoors, you hold on to the incredible view of the river and of Brooklyn as the entire restaurant is glass. You also get that winter coziness from the open kitchen with its big brick-oven-style pizza oven's fire visible from the entire right-hand side of the restaurant.

Stopped by Industry Kitchen for brunch on a busy Sunday afternoon. We had a reservation so were seated immediately but in any case they seemed to be managing the crowd well.

Love the Breakfast Pizza - great combination of ingredients and nicely put together. The Lobster Omelet was also very good. The Watermelon Salad was refreshing but perhaps a little too much Feta cheese relative to the Watermelon.

Overall, great place for a casual meal and felt comfortable with the distancing of tables given the current environment.

I went there with a friend, we didn't have a reservation but we were seated right away, the restaurant was empty (which is a reason to take good care of the customers) but unfortunately the  service they provide is bad. We got a table for almost 2 hours and no one came to ask how is everything or is anything missing! Strange! I only have 4 stars because of the food, it was amazing we got salmon and pasta some dips and dessert and everything was great THANKS TO THE CHEFS.
if you're willing to go there dont expect them to take good care of you. Just order your food and enjoy it that's it.

One early January I decided to gamble my hour lunch break and head to this restaurant for a three course winter prix fixe lunch special for $26.  The staff was knowledgeable of my hour time frame so I was taken care of.

My whole was about 45 minutes long, the soup was filling that I took half of the portions to go for next day leftovers and to make room for the entree and dessert. Everything tasted so good.  My favorite of the three was the skirt steak with fries. The fries was impressively crispy and the steak was a perfect medium rare.

The restaurant is now opened for outdoor dining which I can't wait to go back to once I return to work on site :-)

Wow. I walk by Industry Kitchen all the time and finally stopped in to see why I always see their patio packed. I'm surprised I managed to even get pictures it all looked and tasted so good!

I had a Seaport Rye to get my whiskey fix and it was perfectly balanced. So I ordered 2 more of those...

I did have a burrata starter, but I ate it before taking a picture. Sorry. Had the Diablo pizza as the main and I ate the entire thing! These aren't exactly small pies either. It was delicious.. I wouldn't change a thing about it.

I'll definitely be back!

Still one of my favorite places in the neighborhood. Haven't been here in a while but was very happy to see they have outdoor seating beautifully arranged and following all the safety guidelines ! Amazing job by this Management. Our server was Olivia and she was very charming and helped guide us through our selections, we enjoyed the burrata salad, seasonal dips ( yum yum yum ) , a cheese board , hanger steak prepared exactly the way I like it , medium , and the chicken entree. Nothing , absolutely nothing disappointed ! This place is a must visit , in Arnold Schwarzenegger's voice ... "I'll be back !"

Never fails to give an amazing experience from start to finish. I've visited several times over the past few years but keep forgetting to write a review because the food and service is what should always be expected, good. However , this evening , was hands down a truly memorable dining experience. The drinks ( summer house and froze ) were deliciously refreshing and well put together. The server was knowledgeable and guided us towards dishes that were tasty and hit all the right notes. We enjoyed the diablo pizza , octopus salad , lamb shank and my constant repeat item... the floating garlic bread , yummmmmy! Service , food , and the manager  who checked on us , Isandro , made this evening unforgettable for a pair of friends who had not seen each other in ages ! Thank you Industry kitchen for the memories ! Highly recommend!

One of my fav spots in Fidi during the summer/warm weather! Brunch menu  + cocktails are fantastic. Friendly and fast service, great view. A tad pricey but expected when you have waterfront seating in Manhattan.

I hate to write this review because I live in FiDi and come to IK quite a lot, but last night was just terrible. I know the outside area is packed but my server wasn't attentive in the slightest. She would work only one table at a time (instead of checking with all of her tables before heading back) which, as a former server and bartender, is just not the way to run a section. More on this later.

The gentlemen at the host stand who took my number told me the wait was 20 minutes and he'd text, well having waited 30 minutes and starving I returned hoping my table was close to being ready so I went back. Turns out he had multiple tables open but told me he didn't think I'd like any of them (I just didn't want to sit behind the host stand or around the back of the restaurant, sitting off to the end of where normal tables are was totally fine). This was annoying because I was starving.

Then it was at least 8 minutes before my server arrived (though I was given water), and I ordered what I order every two weeks when I allow myself red meat, the hanger steak and vegetables (I'm not allowed to eat starchy vegetables for medical reasons).

The wine took forever, which is whatever, like I said she was basically waiting on one table then running inside, then she'd check on another and run inside -- truly her life would be easier if she'd just touch each table as she walked back to see if anything is needed. Once the wine came I was happy listening to my podcasts and enjoying the weather.

Then the food arrived. Now, it's about 9pm at this point and I can't see very well and so I cut the steak and take the bite and I thought, hmmm that's extremely chewy, maybe it's just a bad piece. Then I took another bite and not 2 seconds later I spit it out because I knew the meat was basically raw. I put the light from my phone on and looked and it was in fact COMPLETELY RAW in the middle. I ordered the steak medium because, though I get a cut like NY or filet medium rare, tougher cuts like hanger and strip I prefer medium because they do tend to be chewy.

When I was finally able to flag down the server I asked her to make sure they didn't just throw the already sliced pieces back on the grill because then you're left with car tire pucks and she nodded. I got another glass of wine I could tell this was going to be a long night.

The plate arrives, and as I predicted, the same steak had been thrown on the fire. I flagged the server down again and explained I tried to prevent this from happening and if they are not willing to cook a steak properly for me I'd just pay for my wine and go somewhere else. She nodded and scurried off. I got a third glass of wine this was getting painful.

Round three steak comes and my god, it's rare, maybe rare+. I ate around a few pieces because at this point I was about to eat the plate but it was awful. And the vegetables weren't cooked hardly at all and they were ice cold.

Listen I get this is Covid and things are strained etc etc, but this place is hopping and there is plenty of room to distance. It's one of the only places I would go because it feels safer than most others. Well, not anymore.

The server saw I barely touched my food and said nothing. I asked for the check and paid. Unfortunately this will be the last time I visit IK. It was just unpleasant and frustrating from start to finish and the thing is, it didn't need to be. If the place was packed to capacity with people all over waiting that could maybe excuse the food and service, but it was a calm, fairly slow evening by the time I was sat. Covid was not the problem here.

Oh the pic I've included is of the 3 rd round steak I was brought. Again, it's supposed to be cooked medium (warm pink center with some brown edges). That my friends, is rare.

Location and setup is ideal for outdoor dining and covid. The outdoor deck is scattered with picnic tables by the water, so bring a jacket just in case it gets windy. I enjoyed the Siracha Chorizo Omelette with the side of their home fries which resemble more of herb roasted potatoes than french fries. The Bianca Pizza was tasty but lacked flavor and could have used more time in the oven. I was curious about the Seasonal Dips which I think would have been a better option. Nothing particularly stood about the place though.

Came here for the first time because I knew they had good outdoor dining. Location is great there is a really pretty view. I got the spicy marg and I'd give it a 10/10. My friend got the froze which was also really good, you can add a flavor to it if you want (she got strawberry) which I thought was really fun. Both drinks were served with plastic straws which I loved. For food we got the cauliflower, the burrata pizza, and the Diablo pizza. All the food was great, but the Diablo pizza deserves an extra shoutout because it was just so iconic. PSA definitely make a reservation before coming here they were not taking walk ins.

Asked if we had a reservation, when we said no she said we arent taking any walk ins... walked away made a reservation on open table within that 5 minutes. She saw us come back and sat us. Wtf is that? Then when sat says we are only serving pizza and salad and walked away. Tourist attraction since its by the water but you need to get someone worth payin, hostice was a joke. Menu sucked

11/8/2020Hello Nikki,
I am sorry to see the one star review but on the weekends we serve brunch until 4 pm and for the next hour we have a limited menu as the kitchen prepares for dinner.
Our Open Table system allows us to control and monitor all the walk-in's and reservations, sometimes we need to stop and allow only reservations. I saw that you have made the reservation for 4:30 pm but still you were sat just after 4pm.
We are sorry for any misunderstanding.

Great location, jokingly overpriced. I got the margherita pizza which is a bar pie size (personal) pizza thats either $17 or $18. Sauce, cheese, and some basil on a crust that resembled the Lunchables pizza cracker. Industry Kitchen is a place to go to in the summer on a Friday night when you want to blow half your paycheck on cocktails and sit outside. You're better off picking up a good pizza, buying a 6 pack, and sitting on the benches near the water about 15 feet away from the restaurant's outdoor seating and enjoy the night.

Gorgeous setting! Great spot to wait for the ferry and warm up on a cold night. Brooklyn lights
dance across the water and the moonlight is reflected in the ripples. Must be amazing in the summer out under that moon.

The bar tender was attentive and fast serving up a good perfect Manhattan - from what I gather not an everyday order.

I chose the mussels which came with delicious broth and tons of focaccia for dipping. It would have been plenty to share, but it made for a big dinner for one.

Lots of folks all around me were ordering the wood fired pizza which also seemed to be a big hit.

Photo of Industry Kitchen - New York, NY, United States. The best deal on the menu in my opinion- the mussels were fantastic!

I'm not a fan of pizza but this is probably some of the best I have had. The Vegan pizza was amazing but that's pretty much it. Very cool concept of sitting by the water and having a quick bite. Slow service and mediocre pricey drinks.  We kept having to flag the waitress down because she never checked on us.

Great place to dine during the pandemic.  First, seating outside is expansive, just be aware of the time of day and weather as tables might be under the hot sun.  The host was nice enough to let us pick our own table and we got one that became shadier as our meal progressed.

The food was solidly good.  Had the watermelon gazpacho soup which was excellent.  A well balanced mix of sweet and sour, some hints of mint, mango and other flavors.  Could have had this dish all day long!  Then we split an avocado toast, nice but nothing out of the ordinary.  There were large chunks of feta atop the avocado and an interesting brush of olive paste lining the bottom of the plate.  Nice presentation.

We had the pizza which is thin and good, and a side of chicken apple sausage.  For drinks we had the bloody mary, which could have done with just a little more heat to balance the sourness.

Overall a great meal and nice views of the river, Brooklyn Bridge and beyond.

My friends and I made reservations for brunch here on a Saturday and I was pleasantly surprised with the size of the establishment. I expected it to be pretty packed especially since it's located on the waterfront, but there was still a couple empty tables available.

My party was seated in an outdoor table which was perfect on a cool cloudy day. This place would be a great place to enjoy your food and drink while people watching at the same time. It was a little squished in terms of the surrounding tables, but it didn't bother us too much. Service was great in terms of ordering and receiving our food, but I found it a little hard to flag down our waitress for anything else I needed.

Food was great - my party ordered family style so that we could try a variety of dishes. We ordered 2 pizzas, 2 sides, and the caramel waffle. I would definitely recommend trying the waffle, it was AMAZING - definitely my favorite across the board.

Only other downside I would say is the structure of the bathroom. It didn't bother me that stalls were unisex, but there were 2 doors for the entrance and they were right next to each other. So when I was waiting on line for a stall, I got hit with the other door pretty hard by another guy who was trying to get in. Having two doors seemed pretty redundant and dangerous. I would be extra cautious while in there.

Ducked into this place on a weeknight to get out of the rain. Sat at the bar and ordered grilled cauliflower, which came out on a bed of smashed avocado with parmesan cheese atop it. It was pretty good, but not as good as the grilled octopus.

Great vibe and atmosphere here, right on the water. The service was very good.

I'd come back. :)

10/15/2020Hello Nicole,
My name is Aylon and I am the general manager of Industry Kitchen.
We do not have or use poste mate. Our delivery services are Grub hub and Seamless. I have told their delivery guy that we don't have that pizza anymore and he just walked away.
We took the alligator pizza off the menu before Covid-19.
I would appreciate if you can take this review off as we work very hard to provide great service.
I can assure you that I will call them first thing tomorrow and address the issue.

Outside seating with social distancing. I ordered the avocado toast and two drinks. They were out of the frosé and mussels, which was disappointing because it was a very hot summer day. Overall, good drinks and amazing view.

I want to thank you for choosing to dine with us and we hope to see you soon.
Please feel free to ask for me next time, I would like to say hello in person.

Industrial kitchen is located near the Ferry terminal. Came here for brunch one Saturday.

The restaurant is huge, with both indoor and outdoor seating. The decor is very American. The tables outside I felt were akin to picnic tables, which I thought gave the restaurant a nice summer feeling.

The service and prices at this place a reasonable. Nothing spectacular but nothing to complain about either.

The food was OK. I had a glass of sparkling wine as my drink though I was disappointed they did not have Mamosa's. I ordered the egg white omelette. The omelette came with a side salad and home fries. The home fries were delicious cooked to perfection. The salad was OK. However my eggs were over cooked they were almost like rubber and hard to eat. I hope this was a one time thing and the chef was just having a bad day.

Overall just for the location I would give this place another chance.

High tech, high energy environment with loud music and high level of noise.

I did enjoy the design and the large glass areas looking out to South Street Seaport and the Brooklyn Bridge.

We came for lunch and the place was humming with activity.  Ordered a pizza (Bianca) and it was real good, nice crust and cheese distributed evenly.

Service was attentive and good.  A bit off the beaten path but worth a visit, especially for lunch.
