Great spot for a date! Perfect cocktails, very special wine and whiskey selection!
There are outstanding wines that can be ordered even by couple of ounces, so, great, expensive wine becomes available to get an idea.
Food is delicious too, so one can have a bite and great beverages and all presented by great service.

Great find for drinks after work at Stone Street!

Service: We came on a Tuesday night for after-work drinks and got seated right away. Our server was very nice and attentive. She gave us good recommendations on what to try for food, wine and whiskey.

Drinks: My wine was pretty good and price was decent for $18 for 12 ounces. My friend ordered the whiskey drinks which were $16 each. Those were ok, a little pricey.

Food: We ordered the mozzarella and prosciutto appetizer and braised pork sliders. Both were pretty tasty. For dessert, we had the bread pudding - this was the highlight of the meal. It was moist and the sauce was delicious!

Crowd: Maybe they are normally slow on Tuesdays but the bar was nice and quiet. There were a few couples here and there but overall, it was great for catching up because you can actually hear each other as opposed to the loud bars around the area.

Would definitely go back to Vintry and Whiskey for after-work drinks!

This place is adorable!! Such a hidden little gem on stone street, a little different than the rest.

I wouldn't come here for a meal. It is just SO perfect for small plates and drinks. I had three of their Texas juleps (to be honest I'm not a wine OR whiskey person so it was the only vodka drink) and they were delicious! Such a perfect mixed drink. My friend got wine on the waiters recommendation and she loved it. For food we got the burrata, Caprese salad and the bruschetta. Everything was delicious!!

Service is a little slow, but a great Friday night spot!

I ended up meeting some friends here for drinks we sat outside since it was a nice day.
Once seated we ended up getting a bottle of wine the Ros√© Pellegrini nice bottle good tasting wine not too sweet.
We also gave the Cheese plate a try my friends picked the cheese since U can customize it not my strong point but what they got was great , prosciutto was good as well.
Nice atmosphere outside, very loud specially if it's crowded a little hard to hear but not bad over all service was good & prices were decent for the bottle of wine it was $50 not bad since we ended up getting two.
Overall all good place for drinks if u prefer drinking wine.

A very classy bar with a refreshing environment to enjoy a glass of red wine, have good discussion and just relax. There aren't that many wine bars in the Financial District that I know of.
Vintry by far is the best!!!

My colleague and I came here for drinks after work around 6PM on a Tuesday evening  and surprisingly we were lucky to find two available seats at the bar.

I'm very impress with the layout of the bar, lots of leg room and not over crowded. There is enough space to enjoy drinks and have appetizers or even a meal.

Our bartender was very friendly and knowledgable of the different type of wine selection Vintry offered. I kept it simple and ordered my favorite wine.

At first, I was thinking of ordering just one glass of Chianti and then our bartender suggested I order the quart instead cause it was a better deal in case I was thinking of having two glasses of wine.

They also have table seating in case there are no seats at the bar. I've been told that Vintry is always busy, but folks usually grab drinks, chat and leave in a fairly decent time.

The smell of the food literally made me hungry in seconds. I'm looking forward to stop by again in the upcoming weeks to experience the food selection.

Cozy dimly lit fun wine and whisky bar on Stone Street.  Great selection of cocktails, wines by the glass and small bites.
Honoring Robert Burns month I ordered the "Fall of Eve" Very tasty and blasphemous!
Afterwards, we savored some wine with various small bites:
Salmon Tartar, Garlic shrimp, fois gras with toast, manchego, camembert, olives.
Good cheerful spot on a cold winter's night.
Acoustics are a bit loud, thus you will be screaming to be heard at some point.
Cheers!

Love this little place - delicious food and cocktails and atmosphere! I noticed alot of reviews mentioned how they wouldn't come there for a meal... I would.. the quality of the food really stands out regardless of the size of the menu... but it basically has everything important enough to eat, and anything i have ever tried there, tasted the way it was supposed to - delicious, well prepared, well seasoned, with great flavors and sized generously per person.  I won't be writing anything about the drinks as everyone else has covered it pretty sufficiently - my favorite is "harry's" whiskey sour - I put it in parenthesis as it's no longer on the menu but the guys that tend the bar would always make it.  Delicious dirty martinis.  Beautiful presentation, service, ambiance.

Came here for a nite cap on a sunday night, situated us by the bar, I did not opt for whiskey menu but a cocktail based on a bourbon,  girl friend ordered a glass of  wine, ambiance was nice and chill on sunday night, our bartender was busy so we didn't get a chance to ask for his recommendations. I was very content w my drink and happy to call it a night!

I stopped by here on Friday and instantly fell in love. Stone Street is beautiful and I love wine so this was a definite yes. Their wine selection is huge and generously priced. I tried their jj Vincent chardonnay and loved it. We also got a meat and cheese platter which was also phenomenal.

I would definitely recommend this place to a friend.

If in NYC OMG you MUST visit this place, best customer service in 4 days!
one of the mixologist Aviva was the BEST we've had ever!
The staff was friendly, caring and treated us well.
We celebrated our 19th Anniversary as a random find on Stone Street while another establishment treated us rudely before we came here.
The best taste in food our entire visit and the custom drinks were amazing!!
Keep up the great experience!

Food here was absolutely delicious!!! Our private bar waiter (Taylor) was awesome as well!!! Music was great too (Even though we took it over!!) I definitely recommend this place!! We had a whole roasted piglet, mashed sweet potatoes, brussel sprouts with ham and salad!! The food just makes your mouth have a party already!! Taylor's mixed drinks were too good!! Let's just say that a few of my colleagues were a bit intoxicated by the end of the night and we devoured EVERYTHING!! Ha ha ha ha Overall, I was very impressed, I would definitely come back and recommend to everyone!! Happy Eating!!!

This place was an okay wine and whiskey bar. Interestingly, I think their cocktails were probably a lot better than any of their wine selection, not to mention I was given a dusty glass (which, although it didn't bother me, I know it would bother other people so I'm mentioning it).

The place is small around the bar area and for some reason they thought it would be good to not only have the bar seating but also tables at the window behind the bar seating. I literally felt like I couldn't take a drink without running into the people sitting near me. I was on a date at this place so it made it sort of awkward.

Overall, it was decent and it's a good date spot (lighting, selection of drinks, etc). It just didn't "wow" me like I had expected it to, given it's reputation on yelp.

I like it! Great location and charming interior. The cocktail selection is unrivaled and I'm thrilled that they offer flights. Hoping the options rotate on those.

Only drawback is brushing shoulders with Wall Street d-bags.‚Äç

Love this bar, love Stone Street, love the staff, love the wine selection - I have no complaints here, it's just a really happy place!

I brought my boyfriend and his mom here in December and fell in love. It was a cozy night, around happy hour and the place was pretty packed but we managed to find a seat.  The menu can be a bit overwhelming because there are so many options and you want to try everything.  My advice - if you don't know, just ask the bartender or the server to pick, they won't steer you wrong.

I came back again yesterday with my boyfriend and a friend who was in town visiting and while it was much slower, the experience was still fantastic.  We had almost the whole place to ourselves which was really fun.

Brad was bartending, and we talked quite a bit with him.  Really great guy, personable, knowledgable, fun.  He made us a sample of something he's trying out for the spring menu and I won't give any secrets, but I'll tell you it was complex, delicious, light, and everything you want in a drink.

Next time I'll have to go back for brunch!

I can't wait for the outdoor seating! But it's also a cute and cozy place if you're trying to get out of the cold. I ordered the tuna tartar and a glass of wine. Tuna tartar was good but not amazing.

I was planning on just having a quick bite then walking back home. I started talking to someone who sat down close to me at the bar, as well as the bartender. The bartender Diana was amazing. Super friendly and attentive. I usually don't go out to eat by myself.

I was surprised to find out that many of the people who live in the neighborhood come to stone street so often that they pretty much all know each other. Either they have already met, or they try to become friends with the people they don't know. So that was pretty cool in a weird way.

I would love to try something else on the menu and will definitely come back.

This is my to go bar when in Stone Street. I really love the decor, the wood work is amazing. It's elegant but cozy at the same time.
This is a bar for true wine lovers and or whiskey lovers.
The wine and whiskey list it's more like a real menu then a list. The bar also offers tapas style food items.

Was looking for a cheese plate and this one gives you all the flexibility. Ordered two cheese and one meat from charcuterie list. Yummy Manchego, very nice Jamon, and enough mainstream choices for an uneducated pallet like mine. Got the Gingerade 2.0, which is a must for any fan of the Moscow Mule.

Lots of other restaurants around if you don't like the fussy menu.

This place is cute inside and seating is also available outside. It will satisfy a wide selection of palates with wines, whiskey, and cocktails. It's a place where food is also curated well.

I visited this place with some friends and the vegetarian, meat eater, and pescaterian all found something they liked. The truffle mushroom cavatelli is worth it and a good size. The papas were not bravas but still good potatoes. The octopus salad was also good but nothing extraordinary.

I don't drink anymore, but I came here to catch up with a small group of friends. I was only lightly shamed for not ordering a drink (nothing in the menu is non-alcoholic) by having multiple employees ask multiple times if I wanted to order a drink, and one server walking away with a dismissive sniff.

If you want a surer bet, stick to the wine or spirits and avoid the cocktails (a friend said theirs tasted like juice). Another friend had an issue with a dusty glass. But they were attentive with refilling our waters, which I appreciated.

I ordered the goats cheese and asparagus omelette, which surprisingly worked and the egg wasn't too heavy.

The service was good and the food came out pretty fast.

A quiet intimate setting. Nothing fabulous but a solid choice for the area.

Love coming here on a Friday after work right before I head home. The selection of wines is nice however I'd like to see more champagne glass offerings, as there are far too few and many women tend to like champagne. My server, Miguel, was super friendly and made me cocktails with champagne that weren't even on the menu! Perfect spot for a date or to hang out with a group of close friends. I'll be making many happy returns!

ATROCIOUS CUSTOMER SERVICE. DO NOT EAT HERE IF YOU HAVE ANY DIETARY RESTRICTIONS. I am a pescatarian and ordered garlic shrimp. No mention of meat in the dish. It arrives, I have one bite and taste meat likely beef. I haven't eaten beef in 15 years and there no NO MENTION OF THIS ON THE MENU. WHY WOULD YOU PUT BEEF IN A GARLIC SHRIMP ESPECIALLY WITHOUT MENTIONING. I called it took several minutes for me to even get an answer and the "manager" was barely sorry. Honestly unbelievable in this day and age. I used to go here frequently and will NEVER be back.

Planning on brunch in FiDi? Then here is where you will want to be! Great food, friendly staff, and awesome atmosphere!

Came here for brunch at noon on a Sunday and it did not disappoint one bit. I'll let the photos of the eggs benny smoked Canadian bacon hollandaise and the brie du pommier and jambon de bayonne  along with mimosa speak for itself.

Very cool place with great drinks, good charcuterie, and awesome service.
Went there with my husband and the atmosphere was perfect, low lit, casual but fancy.

It's pricey but not crazy, it's worth the price. Unless you're starving and looking for a big meal. Maybe grab some drinks and some appetizers here and go somewhere else for dinner.

One of the seemingly few spots that's open on a Sunday evening in the downtown area. Great decor, fresh and delicious small plates and desserts. We loved the sliders and charcuterie. I rarely drink but tasted a lovely cider. I had espresso instead, which was perfect with the caramel popcorn ice cream Sunday dessert.

Absolutely love this place! I've been a patron here for 8 years! And let me tell you that, they are good people all around! Drinks are amazing! Food is great! And the Whiskey selection is some of the most expansive I've seen in NYC! Their prices for certain single malts are very fair, compared to other places! Always clean, the music is always cool, and it's always familiar faces here! When you do right by your patrons, they are loyal! This place is like a little hole in the wall and compared to the other establishments on Stone Street, it's a very mature crowd, not necessarily older, but mature; I've yet to run into a belligerent or overly obnoxious patron here! Keep up the good work!

The "Muddled" Old Fashioned is the best I've ever had, and I suggest people try it once, that usually gets them hooked!!

This is a wonderful place full of wonderful memories for me and my significant other. :) Vintry has an amazing wine and whiskey selection and hands down, the BEST whiskey sours in Manhattan. Actually, their whiskey sour is technically a "Boston sour" because they add a frothy egg white and brandied cherries to it.

I don't even usually like whiskey drinks, but I can easily drink 2-3 of these in one sitting. (Much to the chagrin of my waistline and my wallet.)

This is a wonderful place for a date, special occasion or "just because". Also, they keep some kind of rare and expensive wines open behind the bar that you can try by the glass -- not a lot of places do that!

I love you, Vintry.

Firstly, what a great bar! The staff is attentive and both the wine & whiskey selections are outstanding, not to mention the cocktails with house made mixers.

During the warmer months, outdoor seating is available in the shared environment with the rest of the Stone St establishments. Indoor seating is cozy and comfortable. Music selection is very good, especially for conversation.

Food is small plates of well designed and prepared selections. We had both the octopus and the lamb ragout and both were brilliantly done.

Good spot for the area, though you can do better in New York. My friend and I split the Baby Kale Salad and both of us had the Truffle Mushroom Cavatelli. The salad was fine, nothing remarkable. The cavatelli was decent. The pasta itself was cooked just the right amount. But the dish was a bit too oily and could've used more flavor. I did enjoy the ample amount of mushrooms on it though. If I were forced to eat on Stone Street, I would pick Vintry with its great ambiance and smaller plates. But if I weren't forced to, then I'd eat outside the Stone Street area.

Have been here two Fridays in a row with husband and coworkers. The second time we saw a cockroach crawling on the table. GROSS.

::Ambiance::
A modern looking wine and whiskey bar with high chairs.

::Food and Drinks::
We had short rib sliders and Truffle mushroom cavetelli. They were very good. I had wine and cocktails. They were pretty good.

::Service::
The staff was pretty mean by telling us to sit with a couple (a table can fit 6 people), while there was an empty table in the front, when we told her we were party of 3 and +1 later on.

I don't think I will visit this place again.

Been here a couple times when I met people after work. Located in the charming Stone Street area, this place gets packed very quickly. The first time I came here I got drinks and a bite. The wine selection is pretty decent. The food however is definitely overpriced, especially for small plates. I had the truffle mushroom cavatelli and it was quite lacking in truffle flavor and the sauce tasted kind of bland. My friends had similar lukewarm feelings about their food.

The second time I met a friend just for drinks and we had glasses of wine. They weren't great, and we ended up not even finishing them.

Not a place I'd put in my rotation.

One of my fave joints in Fidi for cocktails and wine. This spot is wedged in between all the loud rowdy pubs of stone street. They have outdoor seating but we decided to sit inside instead. Unlike neighbor Ulysses, this place is classier and has a nice vibe. The leather low back seats are super comfortable. The nosh offerings are pretty tasty. Cocktails here are excellent. There's a great wine selection separated into different regions and categories. Last night, our party had four bottles of this cabernet. We ordered their version of fries which is like potatoes bravos. The meatballs were pretty good. Pork belly sliders were good although I'm not a big pork belly fan. Burger was tasty! As the night went on, other friends showed up and we switched to cocktails. We all ordered different versions of negroni in honor of negroni month. Negroni was ON POINT!

Very classy place, the waitress, Caroline..?  was the best! Despite the ridiculously loud music and drunken bankers bantering, she heard every word we said. The service was superb!
For starters we had the tuna tartar. It had very nice unexpected flavors and melted in my mouth. Followed by the shrimp with white beans. Simple, yet filling and a tad spicy. I also tried a house cocktail: Oaxatan Fix. It has an interesting combination of flavors, which I thoroughly enjoyed and finished spicy from the tequila. They also made excellent margaritas.

I would go again for a special occasion!

Characterized by heavily dimmed lights, wooden tabletops, great music and a Prohibition Era server dress code, with an alcohol menu as thick as a Dan Brown novel; Vintry is truly a gem in the Financial District.

Upon my first visit, I tried a cocktail and two different Reds.  Off the shaken list, the "Cameron's Kick" was very nice.  Just enough nutmeg on top, with a zesty lemon undertone, the cocktail was well balanced, and went down smooth.  Most of the mixed drinks are whiskey based and it took me a long time to decide-they all sound bound for greatness on the palette.  The wines are served perfectly; in high quality and proper glasses.  Californian Pinot Noirs come in a massive and wide rimmed long stems that allow you to enjoy the divine bouquet.  The list itself is expansive, much like the scotch and whiskey chapters.  Its hard to not find something that you will enjoy.

Food at Vintry is limited.  The tapas styled menu is one small page and quite expensive.  My friend and i split two cheese plates, a burger and prawns.  The prawns are OUT OF THIS WORLD!  The sauce alone on these damn crustaceans required me to use the Lord's name in vain.  It is just so delicious and savory; exhibiting a wide range of spices and flavor that give it a bit of a kick, i highly recommend ordering.  I wanted to throw all my lady like manners aside and lick the plate clean.  I cant get over it-fantastic prawns.  The cheese slices are small slivers; however, it is also served with apricot preserves, nuts and bread.  The bread that comes with is a thinly sliced baby loaf with sweet raisins baked in-truly delightful when paired with a soft cheese, piece of apricot, and full bodied red.

Service at Vintry is extremely attentive, i was very happy upon my first visit and will surely return soon.  The mouse in me just wishes they gave more cheese!

Do you ever go into a bar/restaurant and feel like you are going home? This is what it feels like to visit Vintry, like home. I'm a frequent Yelper, but an infrequent reviewer, so I hope this review does not come off as hyperbolic, but I just had to share the love. This place is so cozy, warm and inviting. The staff are a pleasure to be around. The location is on a such a cute little enclave, Stone Street. I highly recommend visiting if you haven't. I always have a wonderful time here.

The short rib sliders are to die for! So fun to come here at night and sit on a bench in the summertime. They definitely do not cheap out on alcohol here & their drink menu is huge!!!! Shemum is the best waiter ask for him!

Had a great time, pre anniversary and birthday celebration.   Service was awesome, food was awesome, and the staff was educational, friendly, and fun to be with for a fun occasion.    Custom flight of whiskeys, special drinks for my wife, and great food!   Aviva was awesome as a mixologist, as a host, and great time.   Thank You!
