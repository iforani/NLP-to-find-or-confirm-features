YES. The pasta is cooked al dente, sauce is just right, not too creamy and not too watery. Shrimp is fresh, plump and firm. We ordered take-out since they don't have outdoor seating and the pasta was still good when we brought it back home, albeit we only live 5 min walk away. The calamari was fresh and it's served with some zucchini as well. Big portions! We also got the nutella fried pizza dough dessert, which was delish. I'm sure it would've been even better if we ate it dining in. Will definitely try their pizza soon!Delicious food. I walked to this place to only find out they were closed for the day. The chef still made me food to go. Thank god!! I would definitely recommend this place.My boyfriend and I came here pretty late one Friday night after a movie. We were seated right away and the wait staff was attentive and fast. They gave us bread to munch on before we ordered whicH was warm and delicious! We split a kale caesar (which was fine, nothing to  write home about) and the Montanara pizza -- which was phenomenal! Very oily (it's fried so that's to be expected) We live close by and I will definitely be coming back! Reasonable prices, friendly staff, and good food!It can be easy to miss being on a one way side street off the main road. But once you walk up the few iron steps and open that door, you are in a home away from home. With warm greetings from the hostess and sometimes the bartender, you have arrived. The place is cozy and inviting. There are no flat screens or loud sports fans, just a nice unpretentious Italian restaurant. Grab a table or a stool at the bar. Either way you'll get great service, delish food and good drinks.The food is authentic with simple but fresh ingredients. The drinks vary from classic to creative. And the happy hour is a good deal in this area.I've had a lot of items on the menu but I'll just mention my favs...The pizza..not classic New York but real Italian. It's rustic and delicious. The dough has a crispy, fluffy, slightly salty crust and thin center. The cheese is melted perfectly with the right amount of sauce that tastes like fresh crushed tomatoes. It's really good.The meatballs... not ground beef, either chicken or turkey but juicy and very flavorful. They are lying on a bed of sauce and topped with a generous dollop of creme fresh, plus there is a slightly cheesy component. Make sure each bite has all the ingredients so you can taste some of the best Italian meatballs in Brooklyn.Calamari.. lightly breaded, flakey, tender and fresh. I like to squeeze the lemon, throw on some red pepper flakes and dip each one into the sauce as I eat them. Yummy and satisfying. Which pretty much sums up all their food! Go hungry with a little time to spare, you're gonna stay a while.Excellent pizza, nice thin chewy crispy crust.  Legit.Spaghetti, al dente yes.Service could be a bit more passionateWe went here two consecutive Fridays because the happy hour is so good. So this review is happy hour only. I haven't tried anything not on the happy hour menu. Basically there are 3 pizzas, 3 apps, and 3 pastas half off. So that's 7-13 dollars instead of 14- 26 And thier house wine is 6 dollars a glass and it's pretty good. I like the house red a lot. The atmoshoere is nice too. They put nice fall flowers on the table which sets the mood. Though a table for two can get pretty crowded with drinks, food and decorations on it. Also if there is a big party the night you go, like one night we went, it can get pretty loud in there. Also the bathrooms are a bit dirty and cramped. The food is great fresh quality. And the food comes out quick from the kitchen. We loved everything especially the pasta. It is home made and the star of all the dishes we ordered. We had both the orecchiette and the truffle fettuccine pasta. The texture of the pasta was great and the flavors were very bold and delicious. The apps are small in size. 2 meatballs and just about 6 pieces of calamari. The calamari was fried so well and so fresh and delicious but I only got 2 pieces since we were sharing with 3 people. At 7 dollars though I get it, calamari is usually 16 dollars for a whole plate at places. Also the calamari has some fried zucchini in it so even less squid!The pizza dough is doughy and chewy and not crispy on the bottom. The margarita pizza lacks flavor. The pizza is nothing to rave about but for 10 dollars on happy hour its pretty good. The diavola pizza is the best and has the most flavor with the salami on it compared to the two others for happy hour. Besides the pasta being the star I also loved loved the olive oil that comes with the bread. I drench it in it. It has capers or peas or something in it and that makes it taste so good. Also make sure you check your receipt. We had no problems the first time we went. But the second time they charged us 18 for the orecchiette pasta instead of 13. And they adjusted it though the waitress was a little rude about it. Can't beat happy hour prices. Best happy hour for food around (4-7 mon-fri). And get the pasta!!Came here to meet up with a bridal party I'm a part of to get to know one another. It was a good spot. They have a full bar and a nice dine in area.  The hostess seats you once most of your party arrives.  We waited until four of the six arrived (which wasn't long) and we were seated fairly quickly.Here's what we ordered:-  GAMBERI & AVOCADO - shrimp, avocado, baby arugula,onion, cucumber, tomato aioli (not pictured)-  CALAMARI FRITTI - golden fried calamari, spicy tomato sauce-  MEATBALL DI POLLO - chicken meatballs, fresh ricotta-  RAVIOLI DI FORMAGGIO-  ravioli filled with mozzarella, ricotta,parmigiano reggiano, served in a truffle cream sauce, shaved pecorinoromano (not pictured)-  (2x) SALMONE AL LIMONE - salmon fillet, mashed potatoes,grilled asparagus, lemon capers sauce-  (2x) LOBSTER RAVIOLI - Homemade ravioli stuffed with lobster in a mushroom vodka sauce-  TORTELLINI DI VITELLO veal filled tortellini, italian sausage, wild mushrooms, cream sauce (not pictured)-  We all got a bunch of alcohol, but I don't remember what they all were...All of us enjoyed our food very much.  The only thing I can say about what I had is that it was a little more dente than I wanted, but it definitely wasn't bad.  The service was great.  Fast and the server was pretty knowledgeable when one of us wanted something that wasn't on the menu.  She gave her something that was similar...and it ended up being better than what she originally wanted.I'd come here again and try out other things on the menu.Been here a couple of times with friends for lunch and for dinner... great location in downtown Brooklyn and easy to get to. Staff and service are good. They have their own brick oven pizza!Check out the lunch specials if dining for lunch - the mushroom pizza is good and one highly recommend pappardelle al funghi.Pretty good variety on the menu so one should be able to find something to eat. If you come for dinner, make sure to save room for dessert. Have to come back for happy hour...they have some good specials.Restrooms are gender neutral.4.5 stars from me.  Their food, especially pasta, was excellent.  Great chew, you can tell it's house made, no faking a texture like that; I don't care how good your chef is.  I recommend sitting at bar, while busy, I think the service was faster, and they have a massive screen showing all of the day's sports action.  I will visit again next time I'm Brooklyn!This place has fantastic pastas and pizza. I've even ordered the steak which was very good. Ink shrimp pasta is always outstanding.Enjoyed my dinner here. Monday's was half off on the wine and I love wine so needles to say that was what I was having to drink. I love Prosecco and their brand was really good. I also ordered red wine Nebbiolo which was also good. Food wise I ordered the shrimp arugula salad and the mussels. Have to say they were both delishhhhh. As you wait you get complimentary bread with olive oil and that was good and warm. So yummy. The place seems intimate. A place where you can have peaceful dinner even if it's by yourself. ‍The waitress was nice and friendly.Landed in Brooklyn with the number one son and of course he wanted pizza.  I did not so after a quick Yelp search (Italian, Pizza, Walk to) we settled on this place.  In a word, wonderful.  Casual, family friendly, but still with a cool vibe. Son had a lemonade while I enjoyed a vodka gimlet.  Yum.  We each enjoyed our Insalate one Buffalo Mozzarella with tomato and one Burata with roasted red peppers.  Also Yum.Some loved the Margherita pizza and I thoroughly enjoyed the Branzino.   Just enough room for a house made Limoncello.Service by Jimi and the entire team was excellent.  Clearly a place enjoyed by locals.  Will visit again.Good selection of pizzas, though I must say I don't really go for the chewy Neapolitan style (prefer the thin-crusted Roman style). Most flexibility afforded by ordering a basic marinara and then adding your favorite toppings. I recommend prosciutto. Or anchovies and black olives. (Don't make the typical mistake of adding more than one or two toppings, it creates a confusion, not a better pizza.) Their octopus appetizer is worth trying.I usually don't go out to Italian restaurants, but I've been on a roll lately due to an unusual pasta craving! Fortunately, this place is only a stone's throw from my office, so I came in for lunch two days in a row. The first time was actually with some colleagues. I had no idea this place was here, but as soon as I walked in, I immediately knew I would return. I absolutely love the ample natural lighting and tall ceiling, the easy-to-navigate menu, and the bread basket (the bread was fresh!) I got the mushroom tagliatelle on my first visit, then the squid ink pasta with shrimp the second time around. Both dishes were good! Though I would give the edge to the squid ink pasta dish - which had fresh pasta, fresh sauce, and fresh shrimp. Everything was balanced in terms of taste and texture. The sauce was lighter than I expected! The tagliatelle dish was good too, but it came with pretty basic sliced mushrooms and the pasta was a bit tougher than I would have liked. Still a solid option, though. Service was good both times. It got busy during peak lunch hour, but it wasn't too loud, so I think it's a great option for grabbing lunch/dinner with a group!Wow. I was here solo the night before the nearby  90th Anniversary celebration of Analog Science Fiction magazine. Through the big glass you can see a serious pizza oven. I was more in the mood for pasta, though, and all the selections looked great. I thought I was goIng to have the mushroom and truffle pasta, so I ordered a glass of red wine (the Nebbiolo).Then I saw Frank's pasta, with Branzino and shrimp. Score, and I wasn't disappointed. The Branzino took me back to a memorable dinner in Venice where that fish was the showcase. And red wine with fish? They do that all over Puglia.I unlocked the free limoncello check-in special. It is made in-house and is superb. Not overly sweet and a respectable punch of alcohol. For dolce, the little bite-size Nutella pastries called Coccole. Three people could share a dessert like this. The pastries were fresh and hot, and sliced strawberries balanced the richness of the melted Nutella on the pastries.We ordered through Grubhub/Seamless. I am sure the food was wonderful, but it arrived an hour after it was to be picked up from the restaurant. The seamless guy chose to deliver an hour's worth of other food to other people before it arrived. When it did, the pizza box was soaked through and the pizza poking out the bottom. The pizza and the pasta we ordered were ice cold. Like sitting out in the winter time cold. Not just cooled off. It had to get thrown away and my wife, son, and I ate cereal for dinner.  Seamless ended up refunding my money after a half hour of complaining. I let the manager at the restaurant know about the poor delivery service and he recommended I try UberEats or Caviar next time. While this is not the restaurant's fault, the restaurant does get a lot of complaints from people who use GrubHub and Seamless. It's easy enough to say ""we are not responsible once it is picked up"" but this does reflect on an experience with a restaurant. Dinner was ruined. I do think in a smaller way a restaurant has to accept some responsibility if they are going to use a delivery service for their food.  I didn't feel like giving them a low grade though, but I do think people should be warned.Carlos is amazing... so sad to hear that he's leaving. He's always smiling and giving a wonderful dining experience. He was one of the highlights of Forno. Best of luck!!! The Ravioli and the calamari are my favorites!! In the four years of getting the same thing, almost every time, they have never disappointed.We were here on a Friday night for a friend's birthday. We had reservations and were seated immediately. Our server brought out the menus and we ordered drinks. Once we decided on the food, we gave our order. The food came out very fast, we still haven't gotten our drinks at this point. So we waited sometime for our drinks and finally 3 of the drinks came out and we were waiting on one more. Food came out first, then the drinks and some more time later we got some bread on the table. Finally, at last, the bread. The food and the drinks were delicious. We enjoyed our meals however there was no attention to our group. Although the server was seemingly friendly, he didn't give a damn and made us wait for drinks, bread and our check. Once we paid, we had to wait forever for him to bring back our cards. Good food and lovely decor.MORE THAN 5 stars - 1,000 stars!My server, Ellie was tremendously amazing! She was professional, intelligent about to the menu, eccentric and on top of her section. Not to mention, the food was to die for! Love the Happy Hour here! I will for sure come back as long as I am in Ellie's section!Took my parents out on a Sunday night and this place was near their hotel. Spacious, open, staff were friendly and the food was delicious. We started with the kale Cesar - it's big enough for everyone to have a little bit. I had the short ribs with mashed potatoes - definite comfort food. I tried the shrimp tagliolini (yum) and the ravioli de formaggio (also yum) - my dad commented that he would order the pollo arrosto again ""probably tomorrow"" we finished with tiramisu. Will definitely be back to try more pasta and pizza next time.SQUID INK TAGLIOLINI WITH SHRIMP IN BRANDY SAUCE. YES. The pasta is cooked al dente, sauce is just right, not too creamy and not too watery. Shrimp is fresh, plump and firm.

We had both the orecchiette and the truffle fettuccine pasta. The texture of the pasta was great and the flavors were very bold and delicious. The apps are small in size. 2 meatballs and just about 6 pieces of calamari. The calamari was fried so well and so fresh and delicious but I only got 2 pieces since we were sharing with 3 people. At 7 dollars though I get it, calamari is usually 16 dollars for a whole plate at places. Also the calamari has some fried zucchini in it so even less squid!The pizza dough is doughy and chewy and not crispy on the bottom. The margarita pizza lacks flavor. The pizza is nothing to rave about but for 10 dollars on happy hour its pretty good. The diavola pizza is the best and has the most flavor with the salami on it compared to the two others for happy hour. Besides the pasta being the star I also loved loved the olive oil that comes with the bread. I drench it in it. It has capers or peas or something in it and that makes it taste so good. Also make sure you check your receipt. We had no problems the first time we went. But the second time they charged us 18 for the orecchiette pasta instead of 13. And they adjusted it though the waitress was a little rude about it. Can't beat happy hour prices. Best happy hour for food around (4-7 mon-fri). And get the pasta!!Came here to meet up with a bridal party I'm a part of to get to know one another. It was a good spot. They have a full bar and a nice dine in area.  The hostess seats you once most of your party arrives.  We waited until four of the six arrived (which wasn't long) and we were seated fairly quickly.Here's what we ordered:-  GAMBERI & AVOCADO - shrimp, avocado, baby arugula,onion, cucumber, tomato aioli (not pictured)-  CALAMARI FRITTI - golden fried calamari, spicy tomato sauce-  MEATBALL DI POLLO - chicken meatballs, fresh ricotta-  RAVIOLI DI FORMAGGIO-  ravioli filled with mozzarella, ricotta,parmigiano reggiano, served in a truffle cream sauce, shaved pecorinoromano (not pictured)-  (2x) SALMONE AL LIMONE - salmon fillet, mashed potatoes,grilled asparagus, lemon capers sauce-  (2x) LOBSTER RAVIOLI - Homemade ravioli stuffed with lobster in a mushroom vodka sauce-  TORTELLINI DI VITELLO veal filled tortellini, italian sausage, wild mushrooms, cream sauce (not pictured)-  We all got a bunch of alcohol, but I don't remember what they all were...All of us enjoyed our food very much.  The only thing I can say about what I had is that it was a little more dente than I wanted, but it definitely wasn't bad.  The service was great.  Fast and the server was pretty knowledgeable when one of us wanted something that wasn't on the menu.  She gave her something that was similar...and it ended up being better than what she originally wanted.I'd come here again and try out other things on the menu.Been here a couple of times with friends for lunch and for dinner... great location in downtown Brooklyn and easy to get to. Staff and service are good. They have their own brick oven pizza!Check out the lunch specials if dining for lunch - the mushroom pizza is good and one highly recommend pappardelle al funghi.Pretty good variety on the menu so one should be able to find something to eat. If you come for dinner, make sure to save room for dessert. Have to come back for happy hour...they have some good specials.Restrooms are gender neutral.4.5 stars from me.  Their food, especially pasta, was excellent.  Great chew, you can tell it's house made, no faking a texture like that; I don't care how good your chef is.  I recommend sitting at bar, while busy, I think the service was faster, and they have a massive screen showing all of the day's sports action.  I will visit again next time I'm Brooklyn!This place has fantastic pastas and pizza. I've even ordered the steak which was very good. Ink shrimp pasta is always outstanding.Enjoyed my dinner here. Monday's was half off on the wine and I love wine so needles to say that was what I was having to drink. I love Prosecco and their brand was really good. I also ordered red wine Nebbiolo which was also good. Food wise I ordered the shrimp arugula salad and the mussels. Have to say they were both delishhhhh. As you wait you get complimentary bread with olive oil and that was good and warm. So yummy. The place seems intimate. A place where you can have peaceful dinner even if it's by yourself. ‍The waitress was nice and friendly.Landed in Brooklyn with the number one son and of course he wanted pizza.  I did not so after a quick Yelp search (Italian, Pizza, Walk to) we settled on this place.  In a word, wonderful.  Casual, family friendly, but still with a cool vibe. Son had a lemonade while I enjoyed a vodka gimlet.  Yum.  We each enjoyed our Insalate one Buffalo Mozzarella with tomato and one Burata with roasted red peppers.  Also Yum.Some loved the Margherita pizza and I thoroughly enjoyed the Branzino.   Just enough room for a house made Limoncello.Service by Jimi and the entire team was excellent.  Clearly a place enjoyed by locals.  Will visit again.Good selection of pizzas, though I must say I don't really go for the chewy Neapolitan style (prefer the thin-crusted Roman style). Most flexibility afforded by ordering a basic marinara and then adding your favorite toppings. I recommend prosciutto. Or anchovies and black olives. (Don't make the typical mistake of adding more than one or two toppings, it creates a confusion, not a better pizza.) Their octopus appetizer is worth trying.I usually don't go out to Italian restaurants, but I've been on a roll lately due to an unusual pasta craving! Fortunately, this place is only a stone's throw from my office, so I came in for lunch two days in a row. The first time was actually with some colleagues. I had no idea this place was here, but as soon as I walked in, I immediately knew I would return. I absolutely love the ample natural lighting and tall ceiling, the easy-to-navigate menu, and the bread basket (the bread was fresh!) I got the mushroom tagliatelle on my first visit, then the squid ink pasta with shrimp the second time around. Both dishes were good! Though I would give the edge to the squid ink pasta dish - which had fresh pasta, fresh sauce, and fresh shrimp. Everything was balanced in terms of taste and texture. The sauce was lighter than I expected! The tagliatelle dish was good too, but it came with pretty basic sliced mushrooms and the pasta was a bit tougher than I would have liked. Still a solid option, though. Service was good both times. It got busy during peak lunch hour, but it wasn't too loud, so I think it's a great option for grabbing lunch/dinner with a group!Wow. I was here solo the night before the nearby  90th Anniversary celebration of Analog Science Fiction magazine. Through the big glass you can see a serious pizza oven. I was more in the mood for pasta, though, and all the selections looked great. I thought I was goIng to have the mushroom and truffle pasta, so I ordered a glass of red wine (the Nebbiolo).Then I saw Frank's pasta, with Branzino and shrimp. Score, and I wasn't disappointed. The Branzino took me back to a memorable dinner in Venice where that fish was the showcase. And red wine with fish? They do that all over Puglia.I unlocked the free limoncello check-in special. It is made in-house and is superb. Not overly sweet and a respectable punch of alcohol. For dolce, the little bite-size Nutella pastries called Coccole. Three people could share a dessert like this. The pastries were fresh and hot, and sliced strawberries balanced the richness of the melted Nutella on the pastries.We ordered through Grubhub/Seamless. I am sure the food was wonderful, but it arrived an hour after it was to be picked up from the restaurant. The seamless guy chose to deliver an hour's worth of other food to other people before it arrived. When it did, the pizza box was soaked through and the pizza poking out the bottom. The pizza and the pasta we ordered were ice cold. Like sitting out in the winter time cold. Not just cooled off. It had to get thrown away and my wife, son, and I ate cereal for dinner.  Seamless ended up refunding my money after a half hour of complaining. I let the manager at the restaurant know about the poor delivery service and he recommended I try UberEats or Caviar next time. While this is not the restaurant's fault, the restaurant does get a lot of complaints from people who use GrubHub and Seamless. It's easy enough to say ""we are not responsible once it is picked up"" but this does reflect on an experience with a restaurant. Dinner was ruined. I do think in a smaller way a restaurant has to accept some responsibility if they are going to use a delivery service for their food.  I didn't feel like giving them a low grade though, but I do think people should be warned.Carlos is amazing... so sad to hear that he's leaving. He's always smiling and giving a wonderful dining experience. He was one of the highlights of Forno. Best of luck!!! The Ravioli and the calamari are my favorites!! In the four years of getting the same thing, almost every time, they have never disappointed.We were here on a Friday night for a friend's birthday. We had reservations and were seated immediately. Our server brought out the menus and we ordered drinks. Once we decided on the food, we gave our order. The food came out very fast, we still haven't gotten our drinks at this point. So we waited sometime for our drinks and finally 3 of the drinks came out and we were waiting on one more. Food came out first, then the drinks and some more time later we got some bread on the table. Finally, at last, the bread. The food and the drinks were delicious. We enjoyed our meals however there was no attention to our group. Although the server was seemingly friendly, he didn't give a damn and made us wait for drinks, bread and our check. Once we paid, we had to wait forever for him to bring back our cards. Good food and lovely decor.MORE THAN 5 stars - 1,000 stars!My server, Ellie was tremendously amazing! She was professional, intelligent about to the menu, eccentric and on top of her section. Not to mention, the food was to die for! Love the Happy Hour here! I will for sure come back as long as I am in Ellie's section!Took my parents out on a Sunday night and this place was near their hotel. Spacious, open, staff were friendly and the food was delicious. We started with the kale Cesar - it's big enough for everyone to have a little bit. I had the short ribs with mashed potatoes - definite comfort food. I tried the shrimp tagliolini (yum) and the ravioli de formaggio (also yum) - my dad commented that he would order the pollo arrosto again ""probably tomorrow"" we finished with tiramisu. Will definitely be back to try more pasta and pizza next time.SQUID INK TAGLIOLINI WITH SHRIMP IN BRANDY SAUCE. YES. The pasta is cooked al dente, sauce is just right, not too creamy and not too watery. Shrimp is fresh, plump and firm. We ordered take-out since they don't have outdoor seating and the pasta was still good when we brought it back home, albeit we only live 5 min walk away. The calamari was fresh and it's served with some zucchini as well. Big portions! We also got the nutella fried pizza dough dessert, which was delish. I'm sure it would've been even better if we ate it dining in. Will definitely try their pizza soon!Delicious food. I walked to this place to only find out they were closed for the day. The chef still made me food to go. Thank god!! I would definitely recommend this place.My boyfriend and I came here pretty late one Friday night after a movie. We were seated right away and the wait staff was attentive and fast. They gave us bread to munch on before we ordered whicH was warm and delicious! We split a kale caesar (which was fine, nothing to  write home about) and the Montanara pizza -- which was phenomenal! Very oily (it's fried so that's to be expected) We live close by and I will definitely be coming back! Reasonable prices, friendly staff, and good food!It can be easy to miss being on a one way side street off the main road. But once you walk up the few iron steps and open that door, you are in a home away from home. With warm greetings from the hostess and sometimes the bartender, you have arrived. The place is cozy and inviting. There are no flat screens or loud sports fans, just a nice unpretentious Italian restaurant. Grab a table or a stool at the bar. Either way you'll get great service, delish food and good drinks.The food is authentic with simple but fresh ingredients. The drinks vary from classic to creative. And the happy hour is a good deal in this area.I've had a lot of items on the menu but I'll just mention my favs...The pizza..not classic New York but real Italian. It's rustic and delicious. The dough has a crispy, fluffy, slightly salty crust and thin center. The cheese is melted perfectly with the right amount of sauce that tastes like fresh crushed tomatoes. It's really good.The meatballs... not ground beef, either chicken or turkey but juicy and very flavorful. They are lying on a bed of sauce and topped with a generous dollop of creme fresh, plus there is a slightly cheesy component. Make sure each bite has all the ingredients so you can taste some of the best Italian meatballs in Brooklyn.Calamari.. lightly breaded, flakey, tender and fresh. I like to squeeze the lemon, throw on some red pepper flakes and dip each one into the sauce as I eat them. Yummy and satisfying. Which pretty much sums up all their food! Go hungry with a little time to spare, you're gonna stay a while.Excellent pizza, nice thin chewy crispy crust.  Legit.Spaghetti, al dente yes.Service could be a bit more passionateWe went here two consecutive Fridays because the happy hour is so good. So this review is happy hour only. I haven't tried anything not on the happy hour menu. Basically there are 3 pizzas, 3 apps, and 3 pastas half off. So that's 7-13 dollars instead of 14- 26 And thier house wine is 6 dollars a glass and it's pretty good. I like the house red a lot. The atmoshoere is nice too. They put nice fall flowers on the table which sets the mood. Though a table for two can get pretty crowded with drinks, food and decorations on it. Also if there is a big party the night you go, like one night we went, it can get pretty loud in there. Also the bathrooms are a bit dirty and cramped. The food is great fresh quality. And the food comes out quick from the kitchen. We loved everything especially the pasta. It is home made and the star of all the dishes we ordered.

As you wait you get complimentary bread with olive oil and that was good and warm. So yummy. The place seems intimate. A place where you can have peaceful dinner even if it's by yourself. ‍The waitress was nice and friendly.Landed in Brooklyn with the number one son and of course he wanted pizza.  I did not so after a quick Yelp search (Italian, Pizza, Walk to) we settled on this place.  In a word, wonderful.  Casual, family friendly, but still with a cool vibe. Son had a lemonade while I enjoyed a vodka gimlet.  Yum.  We each enjoyed our Insalate one Buffalo Mozzarella with tomato and one Burata with roasted red peppers.  Also Yum.Some loved the Margherita pizza and I thoroughly enjoyed the Branzino.   Just enough room for a house made Limoncello.Service by Jimi and the entire team was excellent.  Clearly a place enjoyed by locals.  Will visit again.Good selection of pizzas, though I must say I don't really go for the chewy Neapolitan style (prefer the thin-crusted Roman style). Most flexibility afforded by ordering a basic marinara and then adding your favorite toppings. I recommend prosciutto. Or anchovies and black olives. (Don't make the typical mistake of adding more than one or two toppings, it creates a confusion, not a better pizza.) Their octopus appetizer is worth trying.I usually don't go out to Italian restaurants, but I've been on a roll lately due to an unusual pasta craving! Fortunately, this place is only a stone's throw from my office, so I came in for lunch two days in a row. The first time was actually with some colleagues. I had no idea this place was here, but as soon as I walked in, I immediately knew I would return. I absolutely love the ample natural lighting and tall ceiling, the easy-to-navigate menu, and the bread basket (the bread was fresh!) I got the mushroom tagliatelle on my first visit, then the squid ink pasta with shrimp the second time around. Both dishes were good! Though I would give the edge to the squid ink pasta dish - which had fresh pasta, fresh sauce, and fresh shrimp. Everything was balanced in terms of taste and texture. The sauce was lighter than I expected! The tagliatelle dish was good too, but it came with pretty basic sliced mushrooms and the pasta was a bit tougher than I would have liked. Still a solid option, though. Service was good both times. It got busy during peak lunch hour, but it wasn't too loud, so I think it's a great option for grabbing lunch/dinner with a group!Wow. I was here solo the night before the nearby  90th Anniversary celebration of Analog Science Fiction magazine. Through the big glass you can see a serious pizza oven. I was more in the mood for pasta, though, and all the selections looked great. I thought I was goIng to have the mushroom and truffle pasta, so I ordered a glass of red wine (the Nebbiolo).Then I saw Frank's pasta, with Branzino and shrimp. Score, and I wasn't disappointed. The Branzino took me back to a memorable dinner in Venice where that fish was the showcase. And red wine with fish? They do that all over Puglia.I unlocked the free limoncello check-in special. It is made in-house and is superb. Not overly sweet and a respectable punch of alcohol. For dolce, the little bite-size Nutella pastries called Coccole. Three people could share a dessert like this. The pastries were fresh and hot, and sliced strawberries balanced the richness of the melted Nutella on the pastries.We ordered through Grubhub/Seamless. I am sure the food was wonderful, but it arrived an hour after it was to be picked up from the restaurant. The seamless guy chose to deliver an hour's worth of other food to other people before it arrived. When it did, the pizza box was soaked through and the pizza poking out the bottom. The pizza and the pasta we ordered were ice cold. Like sitting out in the winter time cold. Not just cooled off. It had to get thrown away and my wife, son, and I ate cereal for dinner.  Seamless ended up refunding my money after a half hour of complaining. I let the manager at the restaurant know about the poor delivery service and he recommended I try UberEats or Caviar next time. While this is not the restaurant's fault, the restaurant does get a lot of complaints from people who use GrubHub and Seamless. It's easy enough to say ""we are not responsible once it is picked up"" but this does reflect on an experience with a restaurant. Dinner was ruined. I do think in a smaller way a restaurant has to accept some responsibility if they are going to use a delivery service for their food.  I didn't feel like giving them a low grade though, but I do think people should be warned.Carlos is amazing... so sad to hear that he's leaving. He's always smiling and giving a wonderful dining experience. He was one of the highlights of Forno. Best of luck!!! The Ravioli and the calamari are my favorites!! In the four years of getting the same thing, almost every time, they have never disappointed.We were here on a Friday night for a friend's birthday. We had reservations and were seated immediately. Our server brought out the menus and we ordered drinks. Once we decided on the food, we gave our order. The food came out very fast, we still haven't gotten our drinks at this point. So we waited sometime for our drinks and finally 3 of the drinks came out and we were waiting on one more. Food came out first, then the drinks and some more time later we got some bread on the table. Finally, at last, the bread. The food and the drinks were delicious. We enjoyed our meals however there was no attention to our group. Although the server was seemingly friendly, he didn't give a damn and made us wait for drinks, bread and our check. Once we paid, we had to wait forever for him to bring back our cards. Good food and lovely decor.MORE THAN 5 stars - 1,000 stars!My server, Ellie was tremendously amazing! She was professional, intelligent about to the menu, eccentric and on top of her section. Not to mention, the food was to die for! Love the Happy Hour here! I will for sure come back as long as I am in Ellie's section!Took my parents out on a Sunday night and this place was near their hotel. Spacious, open, staff were friendly and the food was delicious. We started with the kale Cesar - it's big enough for everyone to have a little bit. I had the short ribs with mashed potatoes - definite comfort food. I tried the shrimp tagliolini (yum) and the ravioli de formaggio (also yum) - my dad commented that he would order the pollo arrosto again ""probably tomorrow"" we finished with tiramisu. Will definitely be back to try more pasta and pizza next time.SQUID INK TAGLIOLINI WITH SHRIMP IN BRANDY SAUCE. YES. The pasta is cooked al dente, sauce is just right, not too creamy and not too watery. Shrimp is fresh, plump and firm. We ordered take-out since they don't have outdoor seating and the pasta was still good when we brought it back home, albeit we only live 5 min walk away. The calamari was fresh and it's served with some zucchini as well. Big portions! We also got the nutella fried pizza dough dessert, which was delish. I'm sure it would've been even better if we ate it dining in. Will definitely try their pizza soon!Delicious food. I walked to this place to only find out they were closed for the day. The chef still made me food to go. Thank god!! I would definitely recommend this place.My boyfriend and I came here pretty late one Friday night after a movie. We were seated right away and the wait staff was attentive and fast. They gave us bread to munch on before we ordered whicH was warm and delicious! We split a kale caesar (which was fine, nothing to  write home about) and the Montanara pizza -- which was phenomenal! Very oily (it's fried so that's to be expected) We live close by and I will definitely be coming back! Reasonable prices, friendly staff, and good food!It can be easy to miss being on a one way side street off the main road. But once you walk up the few iron steps and open that door, you are in a home away from home. With warm greetings from the hostess and sometimes the bartender, you have arrived. The place is cozy and inviting. There are no flat screens or loud sports fans, just a nice unpretentious Italian restaurant. Grab a table or a stool at the bar. Either way you'll get great service, delish food and good drinks.The food is authentic with simple but fresh ingredients. The drinks vary from classic to creative. And the happy hour is a good deal in this area.I've had a lot of items on the menu but I'll just mention my favs...The pizza..not classic New York but real Italian. It's rustic and delicious. The dough has a crispy, fluffy, slightly salty crust and thin center. The cheese is melted perfectly with the right amount of sauce that tastes like fresh crushed tomatoes. It's really good.The meatballs... not ground beef, either chicken or turkey but juicy and very flavorful. They are lying on a bed of sauce and topped with a generous dollop of creme fresh, plus there is a slightly cheesy component. Make sure each bite has all the ingredients so you can taste some of the best Italian meatballs in Brooklyn.Calamari.. lightly breaded, flakey, tender and fresh. I like to squeeze the lemon, throw on some red pepper flakes and dip each one into the sauce as I eat them. Yummy and satisfying. Which pretty much sums up all their food! Go hungry with a little time to spare, you're gonna stay a while.Excellent pizza, nice thin chewy crispy crust.  Legit.Spaghetti, al dente yes.Service could be a bit more passionateWe went here two consecutive Fridays because the happy hour is so good. So this review is happy hour only. I haven't tried anything not on the happy hour menu. Basically there are 3 pizzas, 3 apps, and 3 pastas half off. So that's 7-13 dollars instead of 14- 26 And thier house wine is 6 dollars a glass and it's pretty good. I like the house red a lot. The atmoshoere is nice too. They put nice fall flowers on the table which sets the mood. Though a table for two can get pretty crowded with drinks, food and decorations on it. Also if there is a big party the night you go, like one night we went, it can get pretty loud in there. Also the bathrooms are a bit dirty and cramped. The food is great fresh quality. And the food comes out quick from the kitchen. We loved everything especially the pasta. It is home made and the star of all the dishes we ordered. We had both the orecchiette and the truffle fettuccine pasta. The texture of the pasta was great and the flavors were very bold and delicious. The apps are small in size. 2 meatballs and just about 6 pieces of calamari. The calamari was fried so well and so fresh and delicious but I only got 2 pieces since we were sharing with 3 people. At 7 dollars though I get it, calamari is usually 16 dollars for a whole plate at places. Also the calamari has some fried zucchini in it so even less squid!The pizza dough is doughy and chewy and not crispy on the bottom. The margarita pizza lacks flavor. The pizza is nothing to rave about but for 10 dollars on happy hour its pretty good. The diavola pizza is the best and has the most flavor with the salami on it compared to the two others for happy hour. Besides the pasta being the star I also loved loved the olive oil that comes with the bread. I drench it in it. It has capers or peas or something in it and that makes it taste so good. Also make sure you check your receipt. We had no problems the first time we went. But the second time they charged us 18 for the orecchiette pasta instead of 13. And they adjusted it though the waitress was a little rude about it. Can't beat happy hour prices. Best happy hour for food around (4-7 mon-fri). And get the pasta!!Came here to meet up with a bridal party I'm a part of to get to know one another. It was a good spot. They have a full bar and a nice dine in area.  The hostess seats you once most of your party arrives.  We waited until four of the six arrived (which wasn't long) and we were seated fairly quickly.Here's what we ordered:-  GAMBERI & AVOCADO - shrimp, avocado, baby arugula,onion, cucumber, tomato aioli (not pictured)-  CALAMARI FRITTI - golden fried calamari, spicy tomato sauce-  MEATBALL DI POLLO - chicken meatballs, fresh ricotta-  RAVIOLI DI FORMAGGIO-  ravioli filled with mozzarella, ricotta,parmigiano reggiano, served in a truffle cream sauce, shaved pecorinoromano (not pictured)-  (2x) SALMONE AL LIMONE - salmon fillet, mashed potatoes,grilled asparagus, lemon capers sauce-  (2x) LOBSTER RAVIOLI - Homemade ravioli stuffed with lobster in a mushroom vodka sauce-  TORTELLINI DI VITELLO veal filled tortellini, italian sausage, wild mushrooms, cream sauce (not pictured)-  We all got a bunch of alcohol, but I don't remember what they all were...All of us enjoyed our food very much.  The only thing I can say about what I had is that it was a little more dente than I wanted, but it definitely wasn't bad.  The service was great.  Fast and the server was pretty knowledgeable when one of us wanted something that wasn't on the menu.  She gave her something that was similar...and it ended up being better than what she originally wanted.I'd come here again and try out other things on the menu.Been here a couple of times with friends for lunch and for dinner... great location in downtown Brooklyn and easy to get to. Staff and service are good. They have their own brick oven pizza!Check out the lunch specials if dining for lunch - the mushroom pizza is good and one highly recommend pappardelle al funghi.Pretty good variety on the menu so one should be able to find something to eat. If you come for dinner, make sure to save room for dessert. Have to come back for happy hour...they have some good specials.Restrooms are gender neutral.4.5 stars from me.  Their food, especially pasta, was excellent.  Great chew, you can tell it's house made, no faking a texture like that; I don't care how good your chef is.  I recommend sitting at bar, while busy, I think the service was faster, and they have a massive screen showing all of the day's sports action.  I will visit again next time I'm Brooklyn!This place has fantastic pastas and pizza. I've even ordered the steak which was very good. Ink shrimp pasta is always outstanding.Enjoyed my dinner here. Monday's was half off on the wine and I love wine so needles to say that was what I was having to drink. I love Prosecco and their brand was really good.

1,Two 8 Two Bar & Burger,two-8-two-bar-and-burger-brooklyn,xiEBdZ8z5KY21Vw2pY2fJQ,662,4.0,https://www.yelp.com/biz/two-8-two-bar-and-burger-brooklyn?adjust_creative=bMPz0NoFK6qQZAimQncxVw&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_graphql&utm_source=bMPz0NoFK6qQZAimQncxVw,"{'city': 'Brooklyn', 'postal_code': '11201'}","{'latitude': 40.688536, 'longitude': -73.989728}","Walking around Brookly around lunchtime is a great way to spend a Sunday. Stumbling upon Two 8 Two made it even better.They had some nice tables set up in front to expand their offerings for COVID, but we ate in the backyard. The service was a little slow and disjointed but was still friendly.I would normally order a beer with my lunch, but their cocktail menu was too inviting. I had the Oaxacan Old Fashioned (Mezcal, Grand Marnier, and Chocolate Bitters). It was REALLY good!Onto my burger - I had the Breakfast Burger. It was a 5 ounce, fresh ground, burger with a fried egg, cheddar cheese, bacon, and their house sauce. The burger was cooked perfectly and super juicy. The fried egg was a little overcooked but still did have a little ""run"" left to it. Altogether an excellent burger and I appreciated the smaller size. Burgers have become too huge and Two 8 Two's made getting out and walking afterward a breeze. No burger bloat.If you find yourself hungry on Atlantic Avenue do yourself a favor and enjoy Two8Two!Our good burger buds at 282 have been around for a while. I discovered this by checking my draft reviews for them! I am looking forward to taking a nice walk up here again once we're out of Covid quarantine. Why? The times we've been there they've had consistently good service combined with their shake shack like burgers (in a good way). Yes, you have to pay extra for fries but they're delicious, so ultimately it's worth it. They are thicker than McD fries and come with some skin on the tips. Eat them while they're hot for maximum crispiness. The backyard with picnic tables is perfect for a late spring day (especially with the kiddos) and inside is cozy as a backup.We got takeout through doordash the other night from here for dinner, and it hit the spot! Even though the food took awhile to get to us, it was still warm because it was wrapped in aluminum foil inside the takeout containers. The burgers, I got the two8two burger and my friend got another one, were juicy and delicious! The poblano peppers weren't spicy but added good flavor to the burger, and the caramelized onions I asked for added a nice sweetness too. Definitely a solid spot for burgers! The onion rings were good too, homemade as well, though these suffered a bit more due to the long transit time. (No fault of the restaurant, of course.) A spot I'd be sure to order from again when in the mood for a burger, and will put on my list to stop by when things open up again!Had the 282 burger. A bit pricey, considering the burgers don't come with fries but it's so worth it. They're not big burgers but they are filling! More importantly, they're delicious. It's been a while since I've been there but maybe there's a 282 sauce on them? I'm trying to remember the details but in my mind's eye there's just a close-up of me biting into that succulent little ball of future cardiovascular disease as angels sing in the background. Get the burger. Get a beer. Tip the workers. Set aside some alone time to eat this baby so no one interrupts the magic.I came here on a fluke, my coworkers and I were on our way out of town. We came to New York for business. We were hungry and no where to park. So we pulled to the side of the road rto check Yelp for places to eat. I saw the bar and decided to pop in for food because we were hungry. So 2 of us stayed in the car while I ordered togo.I ordered the turkey burger (which was the best burger I've had in my life). One of my coworkers had the regular burger with grilled onions (she was making groining sounds while eating). I'd say she was satisfied. And the other had tuna melt. We all sat in the car (parked illegally) and ate our food. I wished I ordered another to go. That was 1 year ago, I still think about that burger. Awesome Guys!While the burgers here were definitely solid, everything else we had was not. The Two8two burger was tasty but a bit small. The drinks were a little dissapointing for the price, and the fries... The fries were an insult to Potato-kind.They were somehow less cooked than an actual raw potato. By the time they came to our table, they were colder than Russia in the winter, and were blander than an Imagine Dragons concert in the spring.If shake shack is a flying plane, 282 For like an average price of maybe $2 more, u get a burg that's leagues above. Extraordinary every time, have tried all the (meat) burgers on the menu. The one with poblanos--f* yea. Or the billy burger? Yum yum. Just order here and don't forget to add fries because they're good.It has been two years after returning to Brooklyn, and I was delighted to see that 282 was still around. The lamb burger and feta cheese fries were as scrumptious as it was 2 years ago. It continues to be my favorite burger joint.I was in the mood for a burger, but nowhere I had tried before would hit the spot. I found two8two, saw their menu, and figured they were worth a shot- and I was completely correct. The two8two burger is one of the absolute best I've had in my life. It was cooked well, topped well with extras, and wrapping it in foil kept in warm on the walk home (which I cannot say about most places I pick up from!). I was hesitant to get onion rings, as most of the time there too soggy or broken when getting take out, but they were packaged well and tasted amazing! The right level of crispness you expect from onion rings. Topping it all of with their Manhattan, it was a divine meal. I will undoubtedly be treating myself to this place more often!Today, my girlfriend asked me those four magical words that every romantic dreams of: ""wanna get burgers today?"" Yes I did, and, after consulting my Yelp bookmarks, we picked two 8 two Burgers on Atlantic St. Sitting at the bar, we ordered a couple of Sunday happy hour elderflower cocktails. We looked over the menu while sipping the sweet beverages. Burgers are great, but hello, what's this about a blackened chicken sandwich? One of those, a two 8 two burger, and an order of chili cheese fries. The food came out all at once, at which time I ordered a New York Sour signature cocktail. The two 8 two burger includes poblano peppers, which is as close to a green chile cheeseburger as I've seen this side of the Mississippi. Great flavor, not spicy, the beef patty tasted delicious and was cooked medium rare, as we ordered. The chicken sandwich was also a home run. I loved the flavor of the spices on the chicken--the cayenne came through particularly well. This is an awesome choice for those seeking relief from red meat. (Vegans/vegetarians would be better off inquiring about the Beyond meatless patties.)The chili cheese fries, unfortunately, were lacking. I applaud the choice to use real cheddar, but unfortunately it all congealed into a hard top layer that made the fries difficult to access. Perhaps Velveeta or nacho cheese queso would work better.One word defines Two 8 Two Bar & Burger: remarkable. The staff is pleasant and the place itself is adorable. Two 8 Two Bar & Burger is one of these places where all the menu items look wonderful, I had Greek Salad and it was amazing. The team was very courteous and service is excellent. Overall, I love Two 8 Two Bar & Burger.Ordered the Billy... and it may have been the best burger I've ever had. Why? Because the patty alone - can be just that - alone.Buttery and flavorful. The caramelized red onions and the sauce are extra delicious treats as well.TLDR: French fries 1/5. Burger 5/5 Avg 3/5.The French fries were mediocre. I had the chili cheese fries and the cheddar tasted like it was just reheated and plastic. I had the 50/50 burger and that was actually pretty good. i wdl come back for the burger.Came here with a friend on a rainy Friday evening before COVID had us all sheltered at home. We were in the mood for some good burgers, beer, and fries, and Yelp led us here.We arrived just in time for happy hour and got our orders in -- the beer selection was your usual 6-10 on tap, with bottles. We both went with IPAs upon the suggestion of the bartender. Because our priority was fries, we ordered those first -- sweet potatoe for her, and regular for me (the loaded Greek ones held no temptation for me; I had a sole focus, and that was to get deep fried potato chunks). We were also starving so we went with some burgers: the Pub Burger and the Half and Half burger.The highlight was definitely the burger -- they really hit the spot and were cooked to perfection (medium/medium-rare) despite them not asking us ahead of time our preference, which was fine by me. They were extremely flavourful, juicy, and generously portioned. The burgers definitely had us immediately bookmarking this spot for the future. However, the fries did not taste as good as they looked on pictures -- they were very run of the mill, nothing special. Moreover, the bartender was a bit hands-off despite it not being a very busy night.We'd definitely come back for the burgers, but service is a bit slow, so be warned.I always pass by this restaurant and I've finally decided to come check it out! Currently the patio is open and there are tables on the sidewalk in front. I came with my bf around 6:30/7 and we were able to be seated right away. I  ordered the double cheeseburger, he ordered the half and half and we shared an order of Greek fries. The double cheeseburger is HUGE! Each patty is roughly  an inch thick. It was definitely challenging trying to get the bun and both patties for a bite. The overall taste was fantastic. It had the perfect amount of salt and the fat ratio was great. I really enjoyed the double cheeseburger. I also got to try my bf's order. The burger itself was also delicious, but I think the poblano peppers really made it. The Greek fries were a nice addition to our meal. There are huge chunks of feta sprinkled on top. I'm not sure if the fries are double fried, but they were crispy and so so good. I will definitely be back to try some of the other burgers on the menu!Two8two is one of our regular spots. We've been coming ever since we moved to the neighborhood a couple of years ago, at least 1x/month.With covid, we've been getting delivery. They're always prompt, the wait is never too long, and the food arrives hot. They wrap their burgers in foil so they stay warm!They have a small back patio open and 3-4 streetside tables available right now for outdoor dining. Hopefully they can add heatlamps and continue!My only less-favorable thing is the fries. This seems to be pretty consistent in the recent reviews on Yelp. They're thin and taste like frozen fries (a bit bland, not potatoey). I wish they did fresh ones, you can really taste the difference. I would be more willing to pay the extra few bucks for better fries. Their sweet potato fries are good!Located at '282' Atlantic Avenue (somebody is a clever wordsmith), Two 8 Two Bar & Burger serves up high quality burgers and a solid selection of draft beer in a family-friendly neighborhood style pub.  Service is incredibly attentive, warm, AND down-to-earth - which makes this spot deserving of repeat business.The menu is pretty straight forward.  Order your choice of burger and a side, a drink or two, and sit back and relax.  We thought it was pretty cool that they offer a dedicated hot dog menu (classic, garden, bacon cheddar, chili cheddar, and two8two dog).  But, we chickened out and went with two Pub Burgers and a side of fries.  The patties were tasty, well-seasoned, and cooked to perfection!  Our only gripe was the two8two sauce.  There was simply too much of it and the flavor overpowered the dish.  It was good, but balance would have been appreciated.Also, this place offers outdoor seating in the back.  You should definitely take advantage of this while you still can!*This review is for take out:We decided to try this neighborhood spot on a Sunday night. We ordered through Caviar and it was ready in about 15 minutes, which we really appreciated. Everything came in very nice packaging and put carefully in the bag. Our order consisted of onion rings, sweet potato fries, chili cheese fries, two8two dog, Billy burger and Pub burger. The sweet potato fries were a bit soggy, which I will blame on the time it took to bring them home. Some still had a crunch and were very good. The chili cheese fries were amazing! I am usually not a fan but ended up eating most of my husband's side order... the onion rings were very crunchy and light, one of the best I have ever had! The Billy burger and the Pub were very similar since we added bacon and pickles to the Billy, with the Pub being a larger version. The brioche buns were toasted in butter so they didn't fall apart, which I loved. The meat was also very high quality, as well as the bacon. Great burgers. I didn't try the hot dog, but it was huge! It had a lot of toppings but my husband said it was not overwhelming. He particularly liked the whole strip of poblano pepper. I think all items could have used a bit more salt, which is a bit about my personal taste. However, the burger could have had its great flavor enhanced by some extra salt. Will definitely order from this place again in the futureVery solid place for a burger and a beer. Been here a few times and never disappointed. I particularly like their use of poblano peppers with their signature burger, great flavor. Was walking by a few days ago with my girlfriend and noticed that they were also selling to-go spicy margaritas, so we picked a couple up on our way home. Very good decision. Made with fresh lime juice, they weren't too sweet and had a nice kick.This place is under the radar and is never listed among the best burgers on the Foodie sites. The burgers are delicious. The most popular is the pub burger which comes with cheddar, bacon, grilled onions and special sauce. The meat is locally sourced from a popular butcher. The only con for the burger was that it was slightly too greasy. The hot dogs are also very good. They are a foot long and good fot sharing. The bun is toasted with butter which is a nice touch. Two8Two is worth a visit if you are Hamburger conisseur.Walking around Brookly around lunchtime is a great way to spend a Sunday. Stumbling upon Two 8 Two made it even better.They had some nice tables set up in front to expand their offerings for COVID, but we ate in the backyard. The service was a little slow and disjointed but was still friendly.I would normally order a beer with my lunch, but their cocktail menu was too inviting. I had the Oaxacan Old Fashioned (Mezcal, Grand Marnier, and Chocolate Bitters). It was REALLY good!Onto my burger - I had the Breakfast Burger. It was a 5 ounce, fresh ground, burger with a fried egg, cheddar cheese, bacon, and their house sauce. The burger was cooked perfectly and super juicy. The fried egg was a little overcooked but still did have a little ""run"" left to it. Altogether an excellent burger and I appreciated the smaller size. Burgers have become too huge and Two 8 Two's made getting out and walking afterward a breeze. No burger bloat.If you find yourself hungry on Atlantic Avenue do yourself a favor and enjoy Two8Two!Our good burger buds at 282 have been around for a while. I discovered this by checking my draft reviews for them! I am looking forward to taking a nice walk up here again once we're out of Covid quarantine. Why? The times we've been there they've had consistently good service combined with their shake shack like burgers (in a good way). Yes, you have to pay extra for fries but they're delicious, so ultimately it's worth it. They are thicker than McD fries and come with some skin on the tips. Eat them while they're hot for maximum crispiness. The backyard with picnic tables is perfect for a late spring day (especially with the kiddos) and inside is cozy as a backup.We got takeout through doordash the other night from here for dinner, and it hit the spot! Even though the food took awhile to get to us, it was still warm because it was wrapped in aluminum foil inside the takeout containers. The burgers, I got the two8two burger and my friend got another one, were juicy and delicious! The poblano peppers weren't spicy but added good flavor to the burger, and the caramelized onions I asked for added a nice sweetness too. Definitely a solid spot for burgers! The onion rings were good too, homemade as well, though these suffered a bit more due to the long transit time. (No fault of the restaurant, of course.) A spot I'd be sure to order from again when in the mood for a burger, and will put on my list to stop by when things open up again!Had the 282 burger. A bit pricey, considering the burgers don't come with fries but it's so worth it. They're not big burgers but they are filling! More importantly, they're delicious. It's been a while since I've been there but maybe there's a 282 sauce on them? I'm trying to remember the details but in my mind's eye there's just a close-up of me biting into that succulent little ball of future cardiovascular disease as angels sing in the background. Get the burger. Get a beer. Tip the workers. Set aside some alone time to eat this baby so no one interrupts the magic.I came here on a fluke, my coworkers and I were on our way out of town. We came to New York for business. We were hungry and no where to park. So we pulled to the side of the road rto check Yelp for places to eat. I saw the bar and decided to pop in for food because we were hungry. So 2 of us stayed in the car while I ordered togo.I ordered the turkey burger (which was the best burger I've had in my life). One of my coworkers had the regular burger with grilled onions (she was making groining sounds while eating). I'd say she was satisfied. And the other had tuna melt. We all sat in the car (parked illegally) and ate our food. I wished I ordered another to go. That was 1 year ago, I still think about that burger. Awesome Guys!While the burgers here were definitely solid, everything else we had was not. The Two8two burger was tasty but a bit small. The drinks were a little dissapointing for the price, and the fries... The fries were an insult to Potato-kind.They were somehow less cooked than an actual raw potato. By the time they came to our table, they were colder than Russia in the winter, and were blander than an Imagine Dragons concert in the spring.If shake shack is a flying plane, 282 For like an average price of maybe $2 more, u get a burg that's leagues above. Extraordinary every time, have tried all the (meat) burgers on the menu. The one with poblanos--f* yea. Or the billy burger? Yum yum. Just order here and don't forget to add fries because they're good.It has been two years after returning to Brooklyn, and I was delighted to see that 282 was still around. The lamb burger and feta cheese fries were as scrumptious as it was 2 years ago. It continues to be my favorite burger joint.I was in the mood for a burger, but nowhere I had tried before would hit the spot. I found two8two, saw their menu, and figured they were worth a shot- and I was completely correct. The two8two burger is one of the absolute best I've had in my life. It was cooked well, topped well with extras, and wrapping it in foil kept in warm on the walk home (which I cannot say about most places I pick up from!). I was hesitant to get onion rings, as most of the time there too soggy or broken when getting take out, but they were packaged well and tasted amazing! The right level of crispness you expect from onion rings. Topping it all of with their Manhattan, it was a divine meal. I will undoubtedly be treating myself to this place more often!Today, my girlfriend asked me those four magical words that every romantic dreams of: ""wanna get burgers today?"" Yes I did, and, after consulting my Yelp bookmarks, we picked two 8 two Burgers on Atlantic St. Sitting at the bar, we ordered a couple of Sunday happy hour elderflower cocktails. We looked over the menu while sipping the sweet beverages. Burgers are great, but hello, what's this about a blackened chicken sandwich? One of those, a two 8 two burger, and an order of chili cheese fries. The food came out all at once, at which time I ordered a New York Sour signature cocktail. The two 8 two burger includes poblano peppers, which is as close to a green chile cheeseburger as I've seen this side of the Mississippi. Great flavor, not spicy, the beef patty tasted delicious and was cooked medium rare, as we ordered. The chicken sandwich was also a home run. I loved the flavor of the spices on the chicken--the cayenne came through particularly well. This is an awesome choice for those seeking relief from red meat. (Vegans/vegetarians would be better off inquiring about the Beyond meatless patties.)The chili cheese fries, unfortunately, were lacking. I applaud the choice to use real cheddar, but unfortunately it all congealed into a hard top layer that made the fries difficult to access. Perhaps Velveeta or nacho cheese queso would work better.One word defines Two 8 Two Bar & Burger: remarkable. The staff is pleasant and the place itself is adorable. Two 8 Two Bar & Burger is one of these places where all the menu items look wonderful, I had Greek Salad and it was amazing. The team was very courteous and service is excellent. Overall, I love Two 8 Two Bar & Burger.Ordered the Billy... and it may have been the best burger I've ever had. Why? Because the patty alone - can be just that - alone.Buttery and flavorful. The caramelized red onions and the sauce are extra delicious treats as well.TLDR: French fries 1/5. Burger 5/5 Avg 3/5.The French fries were mediocre. I had the chili cheese fries and the cheddar tasted like it was just reheated and plastic. I had the 50/50 burger and that was actually pretty good. i wdl come back for the burger.Came here with a friend on a rainy Friday evening before COVID had us all sheltered at home. We were in the mood for some good burgers, beer, and fries, and Yelp led us here.We arrived just in time for happy hour and got our orders in -- the beer selection was your usual 6-10 on tap, with bottles. We both went with IPAs upon the suggestion of the bartender. Because our priority was fries, we ordered those first -- sweet potatoe for her, and regular for me (the loaded Greek ones held no temptation for me; I had a sole focus, and that was to get deep fried potato chunks). We were also starving so we went with some burgers: the Pub Burger and the Half and Half burger.The highlight was definitely the burger -- they really hit the spot and were cooked to perfection (medium/medium-rare) despite them not asking us ahead of time our preference, which was fine by me. They were extremely flavourful, juicy, and generously portioned. The burgers definitely had us immediately bookmarking this spot for the future. However, the fries did not taste as good as they looked on pictures -- they were very run of the mill, nothing special. Moreover, the bartender was a bit hands-off despite it not being a very busy night.We'd definitely come back for the burgers, but service is a bit slow, so be warned.I always pass by this restaurant and I've finally decided to come check it out! Currently the patio is open and there are tables on the sidewalk in front. I came with my bf around 6:30/7 and we were able to be seated right away. I  ordered the double cheeseburger, he ordered the half and half and we shared an order of Greek fries. The double cheeseburger is HUGE! Each patty is roughly  an inch thick. It was definitely challenging trying to get the bun and both patties for a bite. The overall taste was fantastic. It had the perfect amount of salt and the fat ratio was great. I really enjoyed the double cheeseburger. I also got to try my bf's order. The burger itself was also delicious, but I think the poblano peppers really made it. The Greek fries were a nice addition to our meal. There are huge chunks of feta sprinkled on top. I'm not sure if the fries are double fried, but they were crispy and so so good. I will definitely be back to try some of the other burgers on the menu!Two8two is one of our regular spots. We've been coming ever since we moved to the neighborhood a couple of years ago, at least 1x/month.With covid, we've been getting delivery. They're always prompt, the wait is never too long, and the food arrives hot. They wrap their burgers in foil so they stay warm!They have a small back patio open and 3-4 streetside tables available right now for outdoor dining. Hopefully they can add heatlamps and continue!My only less-favorable thing is the fries. This seems to be pretty consistent in the recent reviews on Yelp. They're thin and taste like frozen fries (a bit bland, not potatoey). I wish they did fresh ones, you can really taste the difference. I would be more willing to pay the extra few bucks for better fries.

A spot I'd be sure to order from again when in the mood for a burger, and will put on my list to stop by when things open up again!Had the 282 burger. A bit pricey, considering the burgers don't come with fries but it's so worth it. They're not big burgers but they are filling! More importantly, they're delicious. It's been a while since I've been there but maybe there's a 282 sauce on them? I'm trying to remember the details but in my mind's eye there's just a close-up of me biting into that succulent little ball of future cardiovascular disease as angels sing in the background. Get the burger. Get a beer. Tip the workers. Set aside some alone time to eat this baby so no one interrupts the magic.I came here on a fluke, my coworkers and I were on our way out of town. We came to New York for business. We were hungry and no where to park. So we pulled to the side of the road rto check Yelp for places to eat. I saw the bar and decided to pop in for food because we were hungry. So 2 of us stayed in the car while I ordered togo.I ordered the turkey burger (which was the best burger I've had in my life). One of my coworkers had the regular burger with grilled onions (she was making groining sounds while eating). I'd say she was satisfied. And the other had tuna melt. We all sat in the car (parked illegally) and ate our food. I wished I ordered another to go. That was 1 year ago, I still think about that burger. Awesome Guys!While the burgers here were definitely solid, everything else we had was not. The Two8two burger was tasty but a bit small. The drinks were a little dissapointing for the price, and the fries... The fries were an insult to Potato-kind.They were somehow less cooked than an actual raw potato. By the time they came to our table, they were colder than Russia in the winter, and were blander than an Imagine Dragons concert in the spring.If shake shack is a flying plane, 282 For like an average price of maybe $2 more, u get a burg that's leagues above. Extraordinary every time, have tried all the (meat) burgers on the menu. The one with poblanos--f* yea. Or the billy burger? Yum yum. Just order here and don't forget to add fries because they're good.It has been two years after returning to Brooklyn, and I was delighted to see that 282 was still around. The lamb burger and feta cheese fries were as scrumptious as it was 2 years ago. It continues to be my favorite burger joint.I was in the mood for a burger, but nowhere I had tried before would hit the spot. I found two8two, saw their menu, and figured they were worth a shot- and I was completely correct. The two8two burger is one of the absolute best I've had in my life. It was cooked well, topped well with extras, and wrapping it in foil kept in warm on the walk home (which I cannot say about most places I pick up from!). I was hesitant to get onion rings, as most of the time there too soggy or broken when getting take out, but they were packaged well and tasted amazing! The right level of crispness you expect from onion rings. Topping it all of with their Manhattan, it was a divine meal. I will undoubtedly be treating myself to this place more often!Today, my girlfriend asked me those four magical words that every romantic dreams of: ""wanna get burgers today?"" Yes I did, and, after consulting my Yelp bookmarks, we picked two 8 two Burgers on Atlantic St. Sitting at the bar, we ordered a couple of Sunday happy hour elderflower cocktails. We looked over the menu while sipping the sweet beverages. Burgers are great, but hello, what's this about a blackened chicken sandwich? One of those, a two 8 two burger, and an order of chili cheese fries. The food came out all at once, at which time I ordered a New York Sour signature cocktail. The two 8 two burger includes poblano peppers, which is as close to a green chile cheeseburger as I've seen this side of the Mississippi. Great flavor, not spicy, the beef patty tasted delicious and was cooked medium rare, as we ordered. The chicken sandwich was also a home run. I loved the flavor of the spices on the chicken--the cayenne came through particularly well. This is an awesome choice for those seeking relief from red meat. (Vegans/vegetarians would be better off inquiring about the Beyond meatless patties.)The chili cheese fries, unfortunately, were lacking. I applaud the choice to use real cheddar, but unfortunately it all congealed into a hard top layer that made the fries difficult to access. Perhaps Velveeta or nacho cheese queso would work better.One word defines Two 8 Two Bar & Burger: remarkable. The staff is pleasant and the place itself is adorable. Two 8 Two Bar & Burger is one of these places where all the menu items look wonderful, I had Greek Salad and it was amazing. The team was very courteous and service is excellent. Overall, I love Two 8 Two Bar & Burger.Ordered the Billy... and it may have been the best burger I've ever had. Why? Because the patty alone - can be just that - alone.Buttery and flavorful. The caramelized red onions and the sauce are extra delicious treats as well.TLDR: French fries 1/5. Burger 5/5 Avg 3/5.The French fries were mediocre. I had the chili cheese fries and the cheddar tasted like it was just reheated and plastic. I had the 50/50 burger and that was actually pretty good. i wdl come back for the burger.Came here with a friend on a rainy Friday evening before COVID had us all sheltered at home. We were in the mood for some good burgers, beer, and fries, and Yelp led us here.We arrived just in time for happy hour and got our orders in -- the beer selection was your usual 6-10 on tap, with bottles. We both went with IPAs upon the suggestion of the bartender. Because our priority was fries, we ordered those first -- sweet potatoe for her, and regular for me (the loaded Greek ones held no temptation for me; I had a sole focus, and that was to get deep fried potato chunks). We were also starving so we went with some burgers: the Pub Burger and the Half and Half burger.The highlight was definitely the burger -- they really hit the spot and were cooked to perfection (medium/medium-rare) despite them not asking us ahead of time our preference, which was fine by me. They were extremely flavourful, juicy, and generously portioned. The burgers definitely had us immediately bookmarking this spot for the future. However, the fries did not taste as good as they looked on pictures -- they were very run of the mill, nothing special. Moreover, the bartender was a bit hands-off despite it not being a very busy night.We'd definitely come back for the burgers, but service is a bit slow, so be warned.I always pass by this restaurant and I've finally decided to come check it out! Currently the patio is open and there are tables on the sidewalk in front. I came with my bf around 6:30/7 and we were able to be seated right away. I  ordered the double cheeseburger, he ordered the half and half and we shared an order of Greek fries. The double cheeseburger is HUGE! Each patty is roughly  an inch thick. It was definitely challenging trying to get the bun and both patties for a bite. The overall taste was fantastic. It had the perfect amount of salt and the fat ratio was great. I really enjoyed the double cheeseburger. I also got to try my bf's order. The burger itself was also delicious, but I think the poblano peppers really made it. The Greek fries were a nice addition to our meal. There are huge chunks of feta sprinkled on top. I'm not sure if the fries are double fried, but they were crispy and so so good. I will definitely be back to try some of the other burgers on the menu!Two8two is one of our regular spots. We've been coming ever since we moved to the neighborhood a couple of years ago, at least 1x/month.With covid, we've been getting delivery. They're always prompt, the wait is never too long, and the food arrives hot. They wrap their burgers in foil so they stay warm!They have a small back patio open and 3-4 streetside tables available right now for outdoor dining. Hopefully they can add heatlamps and continue!My only less-favorable thing is the fries. This seems to be pretty consistent in the recent reviews on Yelp. They're thin and taste like frozen fries (a bit bland, not potatoey). I wish they did fresh ones, you can really taste the difference. I would be more willing to pay the extra few bucks for better fries. Their sweet potato fries are good!Located at '282' Atlantic Avenue (somebody is a clever wordsmith), Two 8 Two Bar & Burger serves up high quality burgers and a solid selection of draft beer in a family-friendly neighborhood style pub.  Service is incredibly attentive, warm, AND down-to-earth - which makes this spot deserving of repeat business.The menu is pretty straight forward.  Order your choice of burger and a side, a drink or two, and sit back and relax.  We thought it was pretty cool that they offer a dedicated hot dog menu (classic, garden, bacon cheddar, chili cheddar, and two8two dog).  But, we chickened out and went with two Pub Burgers and a side of fries.  The patties were tasty, well-seasoned, and cooked to perfection!  Our only gripe was the two8two sauce.  There was simply too much of it and the flavor overpowered the dish.  It was good, but balance would have been appreciated.Also, this place offers outdoor seating in the back.  You should definitely take advantage of this while you still can!*This review is for take out:We decided to try this neighborhood spot on a Sunday night. We ordered through Caviar and it was ready in about 15 minutes, which we really appreciated. Everything came in very nice packaging and put carefully in the bag. Our order consisted of onion rings, sweet potato fries, chili cheese fries, two8two dog, Billy burger and Pub burger. The sweet potato fries were a bit soggy, which I will blame on the time it took to bring them home. Some still had a crunch and were very good. The chili cheese fries were amazing! I am usually not a fan but ended up eating most of my husband's side order... the onion rings were very crunchy and light, one of the best I have ever had! The Billy burger and the Pub were very similar since we added bacon and pickles to the Billy, with the Pub being a larger version. The brioche buns were toasted in butter so they didn't fall apart, which I loved. The meat was also very high quality, as well as the bacon. Great burgers. I didn't try the hot dog, but it was huge! It had a lot of toppings but my husband said it was not overwhelming. He particularly liked the whole strip of poblano pepper. I think all items could have used a bit more salt, which is a bit about my personal taste. However, the burger could have had its great flavor enhanced by some extra salt. Will definitely order from this place again in the futureVery solid place for a burger and a beer. Been here a few times and never disappointed. I particularly like their use of poblano peppers with their signature burger, great flavor. Was walking by a few days ago with my girlfriend and noticed that they were also selling to-go spicy margaritas, so we picked a couple up on our way home. Very good decision. Made with fresh lime juice, they weren't too sweet and had a nice kick.This place is under the radar and is never listed among the best burgers on the Foodie sites. The burgers are delicious. The most popular is the pub burger which comes with cheddar, bacon, grilled onions and special sauce. The meat is locally sourced from a popular butcher. The only con for the burger was that it was slightly too greasy. The hot dogs are also very good. They are a foot long and good fot sharing. The bun is toasted with butter which is a nice touch. Two8Two is worth a visit if you are Hamburger conisseur.Walking around Brookly around lunchtime is a great way to spend a Sunday. Stumbling upon Two 8 Two made it even better.They had some nice tables set up in front to expand their offerings for COVID, but we ate in the backyard. The service was a little slow and disjointed but was still friendly.I would normally order a beer with my lunch, but their cocktail menu was too inviting. I had the Oaxacan Old Fashioned (Mezcal, Grand Marnier, and Chocolate Bitters). It was REALLY good!Onto my burger - I had the Breakfast Burger. It was a 5 ounce, fresh ground, burger with a fried egg, cheddar cheese, bacon, and their house sauce. The burger was cooked perfectly and super juicy. The fried egg was a little overcooked but still did have a little ""run"" left to it. Altogether an excellent burger and I appreciated the smaller size. Burgers have become too huge and Two 8 Two's made getting out and walking afterward a breeze. No burger bloat.If you find yourself hungry on Atlantic Avenue do yourself a favor and enjoy Two8Two!Our good burger buds at 282 have been around for a while. I discovered this by checking my draft reviews for them! I am looking forward to taking a nice walk up here again once we're out of Covid quarantine. Why? The times we've been there they've had consistently good service combined with their shake shack like burgers (in a good way). Yes, you have to pay extra for fries but they're delicious, so ultimately it's worth it. They are thicker than McD fries and come with some skin on the tips. Eat them while they're hot for maximum crispiness. The backyard with picnic tables is perfect for a late spring day (especially with the kiddos) and inside is cozy as a backup.We got takeout through doordash the other night from here for dinner, and it hit the spot! Even though the food took awhile to get to us, it was still warm because it was wrapped in aluminum foil inside the takeout containers. The burgers, I got the two8two burger and my friend got another one, were juicy and delicious! The poblano peppers weren't spicy but added good flavor to the burger, and the caramelized onions I asked for added a nice sweetness too. Definitely a solid spot for burgers! The onion rings were good too, homemade as well, though these suffered a bit more due to the long transit time. (No fault of the restaurant, of course.)

I had the 50/50 burger and that was actually pretty good. i wdl come back for the burger.Came here with a friend on a rainy Friday evening before COVID had us all sheltered at home. We were in the mood for some good burgers, beer, and fries, and Yelp led us here.We arrived just in time for happy hour and got our orders in -- the beer selection was your usual 6-10 on tap, with bottles. We both went with IPAs upon the suggestion of the bartender. Because our priority was fries, we ordered those first -- sweet potatoe for her, and regular for me (the loaded Greek ones held no temptation for me; I had a sole focus, and that was to get deep fried potato chunks). We were also starving so we went with some burgers: the Pub Burger and the Half and Half burger.The highlight was definitely the burger -- they really hit the spot and were cooked to perfection (medium/medium-rare) despite them not asking us ahead of time our preference, which was fine by me. They were extremely flavourful, juicy, and generously portioned. The burgers definitely had us immediately bookmarking this spot for the future. However, the fries did not taste as good as they looked on pictures -- they were very run of the mill, nothing special. Moreover, the bartender was a bit hands-off despite it not being a very busy night.We'd definitely come back for the burgers, but service is a bit slow, so be warned.I always pass by this restaurant and I've finally decided to come check it out! Currently the patio is open and there are tables on the sidewalk in front. I came with my bf around 6:30/7 and we were able to be seated right away. I  ordered the double cheeseburger, he ordered the half and half and we shared an order of Greek fries. The double cheeseburger is HUGE! Each patty is roughly  an inch thick. It was definitely challenging trying to get the bun and both patties for a bite. The overall taste was fantastic. It had the perfect amount of salt and the fat ratio was great. I really enjoyed the double cheeseburger. I also got to try my bf's order. The burger itself was also delicious, but I think the poblano peppers really made it. The Greek fries were a nice addition to our meal. There are huge chunks of feta sprinkled on top. I'm not sure if the fries are double fried, but they were crispy and so so good. I will definitely be back to try some of the other burgers on the menu!Two8two is one of our regular spots. We've been coming ever since we moved to the neighborhood a couple of years ago, at least 1x/month.With covid, we've been getting delivery. They're always prompt, the wait is never too long, and the food arrives hot. They wrap their burgers in foil so they stay warm!They have a small back patio open and 3-4 streetside tables available right now for outdoor dining. Hopefully they can add heatlamps and continue!My only less-favorable thing is the fries. This seems to be pretty consistent in the recent reviews on Yelp. They're thin and taste like frozen fries (a bit bland, not potatoey). I wish they did fresh ones, you can really taste the difference. I would be more willing to pay the extra few bucks for better fries. Their sweet potato fries are good!Located at '282' Atlantic Avenue (somebody is a clever wordsmith), Two 8 Two Bar & Burger serves up high quality burgers and a solid selection of draft beer in a family-friendly neighborhood style pub.  Service is incredibly attentive, warm, AND down-to-earth - which makes this spot deserving of repeat business.The menu is pretty straight forward.  Order your choice of burger and a side, a drink or two, and sit back and relax.  We thought it was pretty cool that they offer a dedicated hot dog menu (classic, garden, bacon cheddar, chili cheddar, and two8two dog).  But, we chickened out and went with two Pub Burgers and a side of fries.  The patties were tasty, well-seasoned, and cooked to perfection!  Our only gripe was the two8two sauce.  There was simply too much of it and the flavor overpowered the dish.  It was good, but balance would have been appreciated.Also, this place offers outdoor seating in the back.  You should definitely take advantage of this while you still can!*This review is for take out:We decided to try this neighborhood spot on a Sunday night. We ordered through Caviar and it was ready in about 15 minutes, which we really appreciated. Everything came in very nice packaging and put carefully in the bag. Our order consisted of onion rings, sweet potato fries, chili cheese fries, two8two dog, Billy burger and Pub burger. The sweet potato fries were a bit soggy, which I will blame on the time it took to bring them home. Some still had a crunch and were very good. The chili cheese fries were amazing! I am usually not a fan but ended up eating most of my husband's side order... the onion rings were very crunchy and light, one of the best I have ever had! The Billy burger and the Pub were very similar since we added bacon and pickles to the Billy, with the Pub being a larger version. The brioche buns were toasted in butter so they didn't fall apart, which I loved. The meat was also very high quality, as well as the bacon. Great burgers. I didn't try the hot dog, but it was huge! It had a lot of toppings but my husband said it was not overwhelming. He particularly liked the whole strip of poblano pepper. I think all items could have used a bit more salt, which is a bit about my personal taste. However, the burger could have had its great flavor enhanced by some extra salt. Will definitely order from this place again in the futureVery solid place for a burger and a beer. Been here a few times and never disappointed. I particularly like their use of poblano peppers with their signature burger, great flavor. Was walking by a few days ago with my girlfriend and noticed that they were also selling to-go spicy margaritas, so we picked a couple up on our way home. Very good decision. Made with fresh lime juice, they weren't too sweet and had a nice kick.This place is under the radar and is never listed among the best burgers on the Foodie sites. The burgers are delicious. The most popular is the pub burger which comes with cheddar, bacon, grilled onions and special sauce. The meat is locally sourced from a popular butcher. The only con for the burger was that it was slightly too greasy. The hot dogs are also very good. They are a foot long and good fot sharing. The bun is toasted with butter which is a nice touch. Two8Two is worth a visit if you are Hamburger conisseur."

Great for a date, anniversary, celebration - there was some thing about the magical allure of the candlelight lantern setting amidst a secret garden while simultaneously floating on the water with the entire Manhattan skyline looming in the back while Chopin and Vivaldi floated in the backdrop of the evening. The food was fixed price $125 per person and afforded the perfect amount of fullness and explosion of flavors.My favorite was the hearty shrimp appetizer We did sweet chili sauce and grilled corn mash and the black Seabass fillet even though the signature dish of the Branzino sea bass was deboned -much to my lazy delight And was feeling owing to it's toasted fried crumb topping as well as the shrimp Layer it was wrapped in.The desert Trio along with the four cookies was the perfect cap of the meal. My favorite personal dessert was the Brooklyn Bridge chocolate ganache tart on a bed of raspberry purée, but the light peach sorbet was almost bursting in its freshness and was a close second. Overall between service, ambience, food options, seafood options for my pescatarian Muslim palate, A new favorite is found in BrooklynA gem of NYC with a heart of gold. The River Cafe helped plan the most amazing wedding day imagined, in less than 3 weeks (you heard that right!). The team (from Alyson to the valet) went above and beyond to help make our special day unforgettable. All in a time of COVID. We were able to have the ceremony, cocktail hour and reception all outdoors - per federal and state guidelines. All the tables were socially distant and they provided the flexibility for family and friends to celebrate within their comfort level.The food - this was our first time here but if you read any credible review you know there is nothing like it. The views - just take a walk around the venue and see for yourself. Thank you River Cafe!Best parts of our dinner - great decor and location, friendly and funny waiter, attentive staff and service. For the price point, the overall experience was acceptable but I don't think I'd ever revisit, other than for the location. There are many restaurants with cheaper fixed price menus and better food. The best dish from our night was the octopus appetizer that we got. It's probably in the top octopus dishes I've ever had. Everything else was good but not amazing.Meh, I've been here before covid and it was good. Went today and they refused to sit me by the water because I wasn't a regular. I asked what it takes to be a regular and they said you need to eat here 40 years. F*ck that. I ate for 3 hours and only 2 of 5 water front spots were filled. To the snooty blonde lady they refused to let me eat by the water at tables that would go empty, screw you. I wont be back again. Why do do you treat non existent customers better than actual customers?Won't be back again. If you won't a special dinner, don't go here. Apparently they only care if you have been going 40 years years. To everyone else, pound sand.The River Café seeks to provide a best-in-class fine dining experience in one of the world's most beautiful settings. Regrettably, it fell well short of that standard on my recent visit. While the food was on par with expectation, a discerning customer will likely take exception to the service and overall experience. If you are hoping to create a perfect evening, you may wish to look elsewhere.After calling me twice to confirm my reservation and inquire about the special occasion of my visit - in both instances acknowledging my request for a table with a view - the Maître D' promptly led us to the far corner of the dining hall, about as far away from the window as possible. While I appreciate that seating requests cannot always be honored, I could not help but feel disappointed at one of the most unfortunately located tables in the house, especially at a time of 25% reduced capacity.Worse, however, was the seating arrangement. It is unclear to me why an establishment of renown would presume to seat a party of two directly next to one another instead of across. No, it was not Valentine's Day, and the restaurant knew I'd be dining with a senior family member because I had told them so twice (at their request, no less). It caused the Maître D' some embarrassment to admit no real alternative was available, and I was needlessly forced into being persistent to secure a different section of the corner wall. This, at least, offered an 'L' shaped arrangement such that my elderly mother didn't have to keep her head turned 90 degrees all evening to converse with me. I am reasonably certain the seating arrangement would have been the same had I been taking out a business partner or formal guest - a proposition I am now unlikely to pursue in the future.Despite the minor improvement, seating remained awkward. The vintage table lamps are cabled and plugged into outlets on the floor, leading to unnecessary interference with tableware and guests' legs. The clumsy table experience was further exacerbated by booth seating so tight you had to move the entire table every time someone stands up or sits down. Again, at 25% indoor dining capacity, I would have expected to feel less cramped. Dinner service was carried out by a round robin of waitstaff and bussers of which there were so many I lost track. This made the experience feel impersonal, confusing, and inefficient. Upon requesting a wine pairing in response to multiple inquiries about my drink order, I was repeatedly passed off to the sommelier, who either never arrived or failed to introduce himself as such. I'd like to believe he was never consulted, however, given I was initially offered the last bit of overly oxidized Chianti from a bottle that had clearly been open for too long. When I declined, the waiter was surprised to learn I was in fact having duck and not steak, as he had previously thought. What good is having a sommelier when a guest's dinner order is not properly communicated to them?Although the food was good, the gaffes continued: A dense loaf of bread served as a starter was only cut once through the middle, leaving us with two large chunks our tiny butter knives were no match for. The irony of being adamantly reminded about a restaurant's formal dress code in advance of my arrival, only to then be forced to work through a fistful of bread with my bare hands for lack of proper silverware, was certainly not lost on me.Far worse, however, was that we were not asked at any point during our evening whether we were enjoying our meal or needed anything else. While I share the waitstaffs faith in Chef Steelman, being Michelin starred does not absolve an establishment of its duty to uphold the most basic tenets of meal service. This was truly a faux pas and made me feel like a paying customer rather than a valued guest.Overall, the food was good, but the persistent undertow of disappointment and frustration took away substantially from what could and should have been a more enjoyable experience. While I may or may not return at some point in the future, I am for now left with the impression that The River Café takes itself a little too seriously given the actual standard to which it (under)performs on its promise of a true fine dining experience.This is second in a series retroacity reviews. What is a retroacity review you ask? It's restaurants that have held such an impact throughout the years that must receive a well-deserved review. We did visit not long ago, however the pictures are from a 2016 visit, since it provided the most memorable of experiences. Sheer elegance and extravagant venue are what comes to mind from this fine establishment. Every time we come I'm still amazed by the beauty of the vistas. The water glistening off our cityscape makes me proud to be a lifetime New Yorker. Refined etiquette is implemented by all staff from the coat room to the manager. The cuisine is always excellent, enhanced by the exquisite presentation. The River cafe experience never falters and is always excellent.I implore myself to make a visit to the River Cafe at least once a year. My wife always thanks me for a wonderful time at such an amorous setting. It has continued to live up to its reputation as one of the most romantic restaurants NYC has to offer.Rude arrogant staff , could've been better for the price, location and interior looks. Disappointed.Fantastic view, delicious food and good service. Everything you want and need in a romantic outing for any occasion.My wife and I wanted to celebrate our wedding anniversary somewhere special and, immediately, our very own borough's The River Cafe jumped to mind. Sure, there's plenty of romantic, beautiful, elegant, expensive restaurants in NYC to choose from, but it was somewhere we always wanted to dine at because of our familiarity with the restaurant ... and we practically passed by it every time while driving back into Brooklyn.There are many great things about The River Cafe, but before even dining here, people who do want to come here will love that they offer reservations 1 year in advance, which is awesome and rare. What's not awesome though is that the area that the restaurant is located in is tight and street parking is not always available, however the restaurant does offer free valet parking.We arrived for our 6pm reservation a bit earlier than we anticipated and were still seated immediately. If you do arrive early, I highly recommend taking advantage of the scenery and getting a few photos in before dining. At the time, the restaurant was relatively empty with the exception of a few parties being seated. When making our reservation, we had requested for a seat next to the window overlooking downtown Manhattan and we were glad to see that the restaurant obliged. The service throughout our meal was good, but a bit mistimed at moments as we were interrupted multiple times with questions while chewing our food. Nevertheless, it far from ruined our meal, but it was a bit awkward 2-3 times.The menu was pre-fixe style (appetizer, entree and dessert) at a set price and a bit extra for the chef's tasting menu. We had no intentions of dining for 3-4 hours, so we decided on making pre-fixe selections. My wife ordered the Sea Scallop and Pork Belly, Lobster and Hot Souffle, while I went with the Octopus, Crescent Farms Duck and Chocolate Brooklyn Bridge.First, we were greeted by a small Amuse-bouche, which was a nice touch to kick off our meals. Second, everything was delicious. We loved the food. Everything was as fresh as can be and well plated. The serving size for the duck was actually quite generous compared to everything else, but then again it might have been one of the less expensive options on the pre-fixe menu? In addition, we loved the extra touch the restaurant put on our desserts to wish us a happy anniversary, so do expect that if you mention you are coming here for an occasion.Everything was close to perfect except for the mistimed visits from the waiters. The food was excellent and the view was everything we thought it would be. What did surprise us though was that the restaurant got very crowded (on a Sunday evening) and the noise level really picked up just before we left. The dim lighting helped in creating a romantic atmosphere, but the amount of noise took a little bit of that away, so if you're looking for that romantic meal it might be ideal to come here for an early dinner before the restaurant gets overly packed.Five star all around...the location, the food, the service, the clientele, the atmosphere, the table settings, the flowers, the crockery, the cutlery, the pianist.... sublime.Came here for my husband's 70th bday, and we received plenty of happy birthday greetings aswell as a chocolate mini dessert plate, after our lunch. What a lovely touch.The views and location are phenomenal, it does not get better than this. For a special occasion this is the PLACE TO BE.Every detail is met, even crystallised salt on top of the personalised chilled butter. My fois gras was divine, smooth as silk.  The herb crust on the main of duck was also wonderful.A meal and memory to remember for ever.WOW I am so impressed with this place ! I celebrated my birthday here with my family and I loved every minute of it ! From the outstanding service , to the attention to detail , the view , the ambiance and the food everything was top notch ! I mean could you expect any less from a fine dinning establishment !! Honestly I thought people only came here for the view but the food was amazing . From the moment we sat down to the moment we left we were catered to . We sat outdoors and there were heat lamps and space heaters . We also felt pretty safe . The food was a 3 course prefixe meal for $130 ( not including tax and tip ) which included appetizer , entree and dessert . I've included pictures of each dish . The plates were small but surprisingly very filling ! We left completely satisfied and raving about our experience . Yes this is a splurge type of place but if you've got a special occasion definitely give it a try ! It's so beautiful ! Also definitely make a reservation or else you will not be seated .I booked a dinner reservation for Thursday night a week in advance. Upon arrival we were greeted and had  complimentary glasses of champagne due to having to wait almost in the rain (also I'm assuming for being newly engaged as I put in the reservation notes as well). It was POURING rain as thunderstorms were forecasted, but the way River Cafe was set up there was no problem having comfort for the patrons that went. It was STILL a packed house at 9 pm. Service was impeccable, attention to detail even though it was a packed house and there was a downpour, the waiters were attentive and had such a great attitude and friendly. My glass was never empty! The prefix meal that my fiancé and I had tasted so freaking great: appetizer shrimp and dumplings, the main course fiancé had risotto and I had duck, and the dessert was a mix of deserts cake shaped to look like Brooklyn bridge, sherbet, etc. Most importantly: the view. The view is incredible and beautiful and made the experience that much better. Thank you River Cafe to end the day to being newly engaged and making it more special!I love to come here to celebrate my Anniversary, service is outstanding from the beginning to end. The view is one of the most beautiful and romantics. Our food was delicious and perfectly presented. Love the signature Broolyn Bridge dessert, and they always take the time to congratulate us for our Anniversary.Went here for my husband's birthday and had a lovely time. It's definitely old school Italian (jackets required, for example) and the views are amazing. You can't request window seating in advance but the host/hostess does his/her best to accommodate. We actually ended up with an even better seat than directly next to the window, so both of us would have the view when facing forward. Plus the table offered more privacy than the window ones. I will say while the food was good, it didn't blow me away. You come here for the service, experience, the views and the bridge chocolate dessert! Worth visiting once as it's a bucket list entry.Came here for dinner on Sunday night with a group of 5 to celebrate a birthday and had a great time! Our waiter was very lively and knowledgeable about the menu. We did the prefix menu so we could choose an appetizer, main entrée and dessert. I got the pear salad, strip steak and hot souffle. Everything was delicious! Others at the table got oysters, octopus, lamb, and fish. Everyone was happy with their choices. The Brooklyn Bridge cake was a popular choice for dessert - very creative display!The dinner was definitely on the fancy/pricey side (men are required to wear jackets). The views are great and you feel like you are really on the water. The outside of the restaurant was really cute too. They had string lights all over a large patio garden. All of the staff was extremely friendly and welcoming without making the place feel too ""stuffy"". I would definitely recommend if you are looking to celebrate something and get dressed up.The area around the restaurant in DUMBO is really nice to walk around as well.  It is directly under the Brooklyn Bridge!This place is a fairytale! Absolutely amazing ambiance. From the music to the lights. If you are ever thinking of going, GO!! As for the food, it was also incredible. Everyone there was dressed up but there is no dress code (unless I missed it).Perfect restaurant to spend our anniversary! We had an early reservation at 5:30pm and arrived just before our table was ready. We were greeted at the door of our car with valet service who opened our doors and held umbrellas over our heads to ensure we weren't drenched by the rain. Little things like that make the experience perfect from the get go. We sat at the bar inside the restaurant and the bartender was very knowledgable about the menu. We wanted a bottle of champagne and he directed us to their Sommelier, who happened to be adorable. He not only knew the bottles well but he was excited about a couple of the choices. He pointed us in the direction of a bottle around $172, which was FANTASTIC. To be honest, I would have paid more for it because it couldn't have paired better with our dishes. Before the bottle was opened, our table was ready and it was right next to the window so we had a perfect view. We were able to see the Statue of Liberty, Brooklyn Bridge, and Manhattan. Perfect.Our server, Flavio, was exceptional and kind. He asked if we were celebrating anything and we told him it was our anniversary to which he told us a bit about himself. I love when servers at high-end restaurants aren't snooty and remain personable and kind. He was wonderful and I hope to have him again as our server.Food:*Appetizers*- Wild Shrimp: shrimp cooked to perfection and topped with crab, white asparagus, and a tasty sauce. I would order this again.- Foie Gras: the best I've had thus far in NY. It was prepared two ways, which made it a fun dish to try with my spouse. Served with two pieces of toasted bread. I would order this again.*Main Courses*- Lobster: this is the dish I should've ordered but I got a few bites! It was cooked perfectly and served with some sort of lobster salad on the side, which was to die for! This is the main course to order.- Black Sea Bass: this was my main course and I was very happy with it. I thought the stuffed asparagus was a nice addition and matched each bite of the sea bass. The 3 raviolis were phenomenal and I wish I could've had a few more.*Dessert*- Souffle: we both had the souflee, which was served with ice cream, and a piece of chocolate. Absolutely wonderful.Thank you for making our anniversary memorable. We hope to visit again before we leave.***Pre-COVID*** Came for my birthday dinner as a treat from the bf - definitely a special occasion kind of place. Honestly, what an experience. The location is outstanding: on the waterfront overlooking downtown Manhattan, with a cute little park in front that happened to be hosting a wedding when we walked by. The service from when you set foot in the hallway, to when you enter the dining area, to when you are seated and taken care of through your meal, to when you leave - *chef's kiss*. We were seated one table away from the window, which was a bummer but still got to enjoy the beautiful view unobstructed for an hour or so. The food we ordered was outstanding - some standouts include the steak and bone marrow mashed potatoes (soooooo delectable, so umami); the three shells appetizer (so many different options! All so fresh!); and the surprise chocolate cake dessert with happy birthday written on it at the end. What a romantic way to spend a birthday, and what a way to enjoy a Michelin-star eating experience. Would love to come back to try lunch here sometime in the future.Never thought I'd be writing a statement this lofty or ridiculous, but here we are: Never in all my years of going to nice restaurants, Michelin starred or otherwise, have I felt so disrespected. Let's get the good part over with first, since the list is short; the foie gras duet was excellent, and enough for two. The view, if you are lucky enough to get window seats, is also excellent. All the other dishes were sloppily executed; the duck was overcooked, the mushroom wellington underseasoned, and the dessert chestnut soufflé -- on boy, texture of vomit. I could barely eat two spoonfuls. If you are going to put a soufflé on your menu, Get. It. Right. The most infuriating part of the whole experience is how quickly the waitstaff profiles guests. From the moment we stepped into the restaurant -- to celebrate our anniversary, no less -- we were treated as second class citizens because of how we looked; and don't get me wrong, we were dressed appropriately for the restaurant. The hostess didn't even bother with niceties (such as a simple smile) and had us wait unnecessarily at the bar for ~15 minutes even though we were on time for our reservation; we were seated at the back of the restaurant and if you looked around, everyone else in that section were Asian -- coincidence? The universe is rarely so lazy. Service was slow and haphazard, and it showed right down to the execution of the food.But the crowning moment of all of this was when our server brought over our bill, looked at it, then sheepishly told us that she will take off the gratuity line they had sneakily included because they thought we were tourists. EXCUSE ME?! As a $$$$ establishment, you either go TIP FREE or you treat all your guests the same and allow them to make their own decisions; you DO NOT arbitrarily decide who looks like a tourist and who does not. For shame, River Café.Celebrated my mother's birthday here. Service was excellent and we felt very well taken care of. Wagyu steak tartare: absolutely delicious; would recommend 100%. I was a bit iffy trying raw beef but I'm glad I did!Mushroom Wellington: it was good, but I don't really think it's worth the price just for mushrooms and what's ultimately a bread coating outside. I would recommend the lobster instead.Brooklyn bridge cake: beautiful and the cake was delicious! However, I wish the chocolate they used for the bridge was milk instead of dark. Overall, the experience was great and the restaurant itself looked amazing. The only thing I wasn't happy about was being charged $20 for 2 bottles of water. Also, the cobblestone in the driveway made it hard to walk in heels.One of my fav restaurant in NYC, and I especially like the romantic restaurant which is decorated by flowers lol, also the dessert ""Brooklyn Bridge"" is definitely my fav one! hope the indoors dinning can open soon!!! Missing those cute restaurants so much!!!The perfect ambience with beautiful classical music the crisp water breeze and impeccable service and ingredients was found in this Covid environment at the River Café.

When I declined, the waiter was surprised to learn I was in fact having duck and not steak, as he had previously thought. What good is having a sommelier when a guest's dinner order is not properly communicated to them?Although the food was good, the gaffes continued: A dense loaf of bread served as a starter was only cut once through the middle, leaving us with two large chunks our tiny butter knives were no match for. The irony of being adamantly reminded about a restaurant's formal dress code in advance of my arrival, only to then be forced to work through a fistful of bread with my bare hands for lack of proper silverware, was certainly not lost on me.Far worse, however, was that we were not asked at any point during our evening whether we were enjoying our meal or needed anything else. While I share the waitstaffs faith in Chef Steelman, being Michelin starred does not absolve an establishment of its duty to uphold the most basic tenets of meal service. This was truly a faux pas and made me feel like a paying customer rather than a valued guest.Overall, the food was good, but the persistent undertow of disappointment and frustration took away substantially from what could and should have been a more enjoyable experience. While I may or may not return at some point in the future, I am for now left with the impression that The River Café takes itself a little too seriously given the actual standard to which it (under)performs on its promise of a true fine dining experience.This is second in a series retroacity reviews. What is a retroacity review you ask? It's restaurants that have held such an impact throughout the years that must receive a well-deserved review. We did visit not long ago, however the pictures are from a 2016 visit, since it provided the most memorable of experiences. Sheer elegance and extravagant venue are what comes to mind from this fine establishment. Every time we come I'm still amazed by the beauty of the vistas. The water glistening off our cityscape makes me proud to be a lifetime New Yorker. Refined etiquette is implemented by all staff from the coat room to the manager. The cuisine is always excellent, enhanced by the exquisite presentation. The River cafe experience never falters and is always excellent.I implore myself to make a visit to the River Cafe at least once a year. My wife always thanks me for a wonderful time at such an amorous setting. It has continued to live up to its reputation as one of the most romantic restaurants NYC has to offer.Rude arrogant staff , could've been better for the price, location and interior looks. Disappointed.Fantastic view, delicious food and good service. Everything you want and need in a romantic outing for any occasion.My wife and I wanted to celebrate our wedding anniversary somewhere special and, immediately, our very own borough's The River Cafe jumped to mind. Sure, there's plenty of romantic, beautiful, elegant, expensive restaurants in NYC to choose from, but it was somewhere we always wanted to dine at because of our familiarity with the restaurant ... and we practically passed by it every time while driving back into Brooklyn.There are many great things about The River Cafe, but before even dining here, people who do want to come here will love that they offer reservations 1 year in advance, which is awesome and rare. What's not awesome though is that the area that the restaurant is located in is tight and street parking is not always available, however the restaurant does offer free valet parking.We arrived for our 6pm reservation a bit earlier than we anticipated and were still seated immediately. If you do arrive early, I highly recommend taking advantage of the scenery and getting a few photos in before dining. At the time, the restaurant was relatively empty with the exception of a few parties being seated. When making our reservation, we had requested for a seat next to the window overlooking downtown Manhattan and we were glad to see that the restaurant obliged. The service throughout our meal was good, but a bit mistimed at moments as we were interrupted multiple times with questions while chewing our food. Nevertheless, it far from ruined our meal, but it was a bit awkward 2-3 times.The menu was pre-fixe style (appetizer, entree and dessert) at a set price and a bit extra for the chef's tasting menu. We had no intentions of dining for 3-4 hours, so we decided on making pre-fixe selections. My wife ordered the Sea Scallop and Pork Belly, Lobster and Hot Souffle, while I went with the Octopus, Crescent Farms Duck and Chocolate Brooklyn Bridge.First, we were greeted by a small Amuse-bouche, which was a nice touch to kick off our meals. Second, everything was delicious. We loved the food. Everything was as fresh as can be and well plated. The serving size for the duck was actually quite generous compared to everything else, but then again it might have been one of the less expensive options on the pre-fixe menu? In addition, we loved the extra touch the restaurant put on our desserts to wish us a happy anniversary, so do expect that if you mention you are coming here for an occasion.Everything was close to perfect except for the mistimed visits from the waiters. The food was excellent and the view was everything we thought it would be. What did surprise us though was that the restaurant got very crowded (on a Sunday evening) and the noise level really picked up just before we left. The dim lighting helped in creating a romantic atmosphere, but the amount of noise took a little bit of that away, so if you're looking for that romantic meal it might be ideal to come here for an early dinner before the restaurant gets overly packed.Five star all around...the location, the food, the service, the clientele, the atmosphere, the table settings, the flowers, the crockery, the cutlery, the pianist.... sublime.Came here for my husband's 70th bday, and we received plenty of happy birthday greetings aswell as a chocolate mini dessert plate, after our lunch. What a lovely touch.The views and location are phenomenal, it does not get better than this. For a special occasion this is the PLACE TO BE.Every detail is met, even crystallised salt on top of the personalised chilled butter. My fois gras was divine, smooth as silk.  The herb crust on the main of duck was also wonderful.A meal and memory to remember for ever.WOW I am so impressed with this place ! I celebrated my birthday here with my family and I loved every minute of it ! From the outstanding service , to the attention to detail , the view , the ambiance and the food everything was top notch ! I mean could you expect any less from a fine dinning establishment !! Honestly I thought people only came here for the view but the food was amazing . From the moment we sat down to the moment we left we were catered to . We sat outdoors and there were heat lamps and space heaters . We also felt pretty safe . The food was a 3 course prefixe meal for $130 ( not including tax and tip ) which included appetizer , entree and dessert . I've included pictures of each dish . The plates were small but surprisingly very filling ! We left completely satisfied and raving about our experience . Yes this is a splurge type of place but if you've got a special occasion definitely give it a try ! It's so beautiful ! Also definitely make a reservation or else you will not be seated .I booked a dinner reservation for Thursday night a week in advance. Upon arrival we were greeted and had  complimentary glasses of champagne due to having to wait almost in the rain (also I'm assuming for being newly engaged as I put in the reservation notes as well). It was POURING rain as thunderstorms were forecasted, but the way River Cafe was set up there was no problem having comfort for the patrons that went. It was STILL a packed house at 9 pm. Service was impeccable, attention to detail even though it was a packed house and there was a downpour, the waiters were attentive and had such a great attitude and friendly. My glass was never empty! The prefix meal that my fiancé and I had tasted so freaking great: appetizer shrimp and dumplings, the main course fiancé had risotto and I had duck, and the dessert was a mix of deserts cake shaped to look like Brooklyn bridge, sherbet, etc. Most importantly: the view. The view is incredible and beautiful and made the experience that much better. Thank you River Cafe to end the day to being newly engaged and making it more special!I love to come here to celebrate my Anniversary, service is outstanding from the beginning to end. The view is one of the most beautiful and romantics. Our food was delicious and perfectly presented. Love the signature Broolyn Bridge dessert, and they always take the time to congratulate us for our Anniversary.Went here for my husband's birthday and had a lovely time. It's definitely old school Italian (jackets required, for example) and the views are amazing. You can't request window seating in advance but the host/hostess does his/her best to accommodate. We actually ended up with an even better seat than directly next to the window, so both of us would have the view when facing forward. Plus the table offered more privacy than the window ones. I will say while the food was good, it didn't blow me away. You come here for the service, experience, the views and the bridge chocolate dessert! Worth visiting once as it's a bucket list entry.Came here for dinner on Sunday night with a group of 5 to celebrate a birthday and had a great time! Our waiter was very lively and knowledgeable about the menu. We did the prefix menu so we could choose an appetizer, main entrée and dessert. I got the pear salad, strip steak and hot souffle. Everything was delicious! Others at the table got oysters, octopus, lamb, and fish. Everyone was happy with their choices. The Brooklyn Bridge cake was a popular choice for dessert - very creative display!The dinner was definitely on the fancy/pricey side (men are required to wear jackets). The views are great and you feel like you are really on the water. The outside of the restaurant was really cute too. They had string lights all over a large patio garden. All of the staff was extremely friendly and welcoming without making the place feel too ""stuffy"". I would definitely recommend if you are looking to celebrate something and get dressed up.The area around the restaurant in DUMBO is really nice to walk around as well.  It is directly under the Brooklyn Bridge!This place is a fairytale! Absolutely amazing ambiance. From the music to the lights. If you are ever thinking of going, GO!! As for the food, it was also incredible. Everyone there was dressed up but there is no dress code (unless I missed it).Perfect restaurant to spend our anniversary! We had an early reservation at 5:30pm and arrived just before our table was ready. We were greeted at the door of our car with valet service who opened our doors and held umbrellas over our heads to ensure we weren't drenched by the rain. Little things like that make the experience perfect from the get go. We sat at the bar inside the restaurant and the bartender was very knowledgable about the menu. We wanted a bottle of champagne and he directed us to their Sommelier, who happened to be adorable. He not only knew the bottles well but he was excited about a couple of the choices. He pointed us in the direction of a bottle around $172, which was FANTASTIC. To be honest, I would have paid more for it because it couldn't have paired better with our dishes. Before the bottle was opened, our table was ready and it was right next to the window so we had a perfect view. We were able to see the Statue of Liberty, Brooklyn Bridge, and Manhattan. Perfect.Our server, Flavio, was exceptional and kind. He asked if we were celebrating anything and we told him it was our anniversary to which he told us a bit about himself. I love when servers at high-end restaurants aren't snooty and remain personable and kind. He was wonderful and I hope to have him again as our server.Food:*Appetizers*- Wild Shrimp: shrimp cooked to perfection and topped with crab, white asparagus, and a tasty sauce. I would order this again.- Foie Gras: the best I've had thus far in NY. It was prepared two ways, which made it a fun dish to try with my spouse. Served with two pieces of toasted bread. I would order this again.*Main Courses*- Lobster: this is the dish I should've ordered but I got a few bites! It was cooked perfectly and served with some sort of lobster salad on the side, which was to die for! This is the main course to order.- Black Sea Bass: this was my main course and I was very happy with it. I thought the stuffed asparagus was a nice addition and matched each bite of the sea bass. The 3 raviolis were phenomenal and I wish I could've had a few more.*Dessert*- Souffle: we both had the souflee, which was served with ice cream, and a piece of chocolate. Absolutely wonderful.Thank you for making our anniversary memorable. We hope to visit again before we leave.***Pre-COVID*** Came for my birthday dinner as a treat from the bf - definitely a special occasion kind of place. Honestly, what an experience. The location is outstanding: on the waterfront overlooking downtown Manhattan, with a cute little park in front that happened to be hosting a wedding when we walked by. The service from when you set foot in the hallway, to when you enter the dining area, to when you are seated and taken care of through your meal, to when you leave - *chef's kiss*. We were seated one table away from the window, which was a bummer but still got to enjoy the beautiful view unobstructed for an hour or so. The food we ordered was outstanding - some standouts include the steak and bone marrow mashed potatoes (soooooo delectable, so umami); the three shells appetizer (so many different options! All so fresh!); and the surprise chocolate cake dessert with happy birthday written on it at the end. What a romantic way to spend a birthday, and what a way to enjoy a Michelin-star eating experience. Would love to come back to try lunch here sometime in the future.Never thought I'd be writing a statement this lofty or ridiculous, but here we are: Never in all my years of going to nice restaurants, Michelin starred or otherwise, have I felt so disrespected. Let's get the good part over with first, since the list is short; the foie gras duet was excellent, and enough for two. The view, if you are lucky enough to get window seats, is also excellent. All the other dishes were sloppily executed; the duck was overcooked, the mushroom wellington underseasoned, and the dessert chestnut soufflé -- on boy, texture of vomit. I could barely eat two spoonfuls. If you are going to put a soufflé on your menu, Get. It. Right. The most infuriating part of the whole experience is how quickly the waitstaff profiles guests. From the moment we stepped into the restaurant -- to celebrate our anniversary, no less -- we were treated as second class citizens because of how we looked; and don't get me wrong, we were dressed appropriately for the restaurant. The hostess didn't even bother with niceties (such as a simple smile) and had us wait unnecessarily at the bar for ~15 minutes even though we were on time for our reservation; we were seated at the back of the restaurant and if you looked around, everyone else in that section were Asian -- coincidence? The universe is rarely so lazy. Service was slow and haphazard, and it showed right down to the execution of the food.But the crowning moment of all of this was when our server brought over our bill, looked at it, then sheepishly told us that she will take off the gratuity line they had sneakily included because they thought we were tourists. EXCUSE ME?! As a $$$$ establishment, you either go TIP FREE or you treat all your guests the same and allow them to make their own decisions; you DO NOT arbitrarily decide who looks like a tourist and who does not. For shame, River Café.Celebrated my mother's birthday here. Service was excellent and we felt very well taken care of. Wagyu steak tartare: absolutely delicious; would recommend 100%. I was a bit iffy trying raw beef but I'm glad I did!Mushroom Wellington: it was good, but I don't really think it's worth the price just for mushrooms and what's ultimately a bread coating outside. I would recommend the lobster instead.Brooklyn bridge cake: beautiful and the cake was delicious! However, I wish the chocolate they used for the bridge was milk instead of dark. Overall, the experience was great and the restaurant itself looked amazing. The only thing I wasn't happy about was being charged $20 for 2 bottles of water. Also, the cobblestone in the driveway made it hard to walk in heels.One of my fav restaurant in NYC, and I especially like the romantic restaurant which is decorated by flowers lol, also the dessert ""Brooklyn Bridge"" is definitely my fav one! hope the indoors dinning can open soon!!! Missing those cute restaurants so much!!!The perfect ambience with beautiful classical music the crisp water breeze and impeccable service and ingredients was found in this Covid environment at the River Café. Great for a date, anniversary, celebration - there was some thing about the magical allure of the candlelight lantern setting amidst a secret garden while simultaneously floating on the water with the entire Manhattan skyline looming in the back while Chopin and Vivaldi floated in the backdrop of the evening. The food was fixed price $125 per person and afforded the perfect amount of fullness and explosion of flavors.My favorite was the hearty shrimp appetizer We did sweet chili sauce and grilled corn mash and the black Seabass fillet even though the signature dish of the Branzino sea bass was deboned -much to my lazy delight And was feeling owing to it's toasted fried crumb topping as well as the shrimp Layer it was wrapped in.The desert Trio along with the four cookies was the perfect cap of the meal. My favorite personal dessert was the Brooklyn Bridge chocolate ganache tart on a bed of raspberry purée, but the light peach sorbet was almost bursting in its freshness and was a close second. Overall between service, ambience, food options, seafood options for my pescatarian Muslim palate, A new favorite is found in BrooklynA gem of NYC with a heart of gold. The River Cafe helped plan the most amazing wedding day imagined, in less than 3 weeks (you heard that right!). The team (from Alyson to the valet) went above and beyond to help make our special day unforgettable. All in a time of COVID. We were able to have the ceremony, cocktail hour and reception all outdoors - per federal and state guidelines. All the tables were socially distant and they provided the flexibility for family and friends to celebrate within their comfort level.The food - this was our first time here but if you read any credible review you know there is nothing like it. The views - just take a walk around the venue and see for yourself. Thank you River Cafe!Best parts of our dinner - great decor and location, friendly and funny waiter, attentive staff and service. For the price point, the overall experience was acceptable but I don't think I'd ever revisit, other than for the location. There are many restaurants with cheaper fixed price menus and better food. The best dish from our night was the octopus appetizer that we got. It's probably in the top octopus dishes I've ever had. Everything else was good but not amazing.Meh, I've been here before covid and it was good. Went today and they refused to sit me by the water because I wasn't a regular. I asked what it takes to be a regular and they said you need to eat here 40 years. F*ck that. I ate for 3 hours and only 2 of 5 water front spots were filled. To the snooty blonde lady they refused to let me eat by the water at tables that would go empty, screw you. I wont be back again. Why do do you treat non existent customers better than actual customers?Won't be back again. If you won't a special dinner, don't go here. Apparently they only care if you have been going 40 years years. To everyone else, pound sand.The River Café seeks to provide a best-in-class fine dining experience in one of the world's most beautiful settings. Regrettably, it fell well short of that standard on my recent visit. While the food was on par with expectation, a discerning customer will likely take exception to the service and overall experience. If you are hoping to create a perfect evening, you may wish to look elsewhere.After calling me twice to confirm my reservation and inquire about the special occasion of my visit - in both instances acknowledging my request for a table with a view - the Maître D' promptly led us to the far corner of the dining hall, about as far away from the window as possible. While I appreciate that seating requests cannot always be honored, I could not help but feel disappointed at one of the most unfortunately located tables in the house, especially at a time of 25% reduced capacity.Worse, however, was the seating arrangement. It is unclear to me why an establishment of renown would presume to seat a party of two directly next to one another instead of across. No, it was not Valentine's Day, and the restaurant knew I'd be dining with a senior family member because I had told them so twice (at their request, no less). It caused the Maître D' some embarrassment to admit no real alternative was available, and I was needlessly forced into being persistent to secure a different section of the corner wall. This, at least, offered an 'L' shaped arrangement such that my elderly mother didn't have to keep her head turned 90 degrees all evening to converse with me. I am reasonably certain the seating arrangement would have been the same had I been taking out a business partner or formal guest - a proposition I am now unlikely to pursue in the future.Despite the minor improvement, seating remained awkward. The vintage table lamps are cabled and plugged into outlets on the floor, leading to unnecessary interference with tableware and guests' legs. The clumsy table experience was further exacerbated by booth seating so tight you had to move the entire table every time someone stands up or sits down. Again, at 25% indoor dining capacity, I would have expected to feel less cramped. Dinner service was carried out by a round robin of waitstaff and bussers of which there were so many I lost track. This made the experience feel impersonal, confusing, and inefficient. Upon requesting a wine pairing in response to multiple inquiries about my drink order, I was repeatedly passed off to the sommelier, who either never arrived or failed to introduce himself as such. I'd like to believe he was never consulted, however, given I was initially offered the last bit of overly oxidized Chianti from a bottle that had clearly been open for too long. When I declined, the waiter was surprised to learn I was in fact having duck and not steak, as he had previously thought. What good is having a sommelier when a guest's dinner order is not properly communicated to them?Although the food was good, the gaffes continued: A dense loaf of bread served as a starter was only cut once through the middle, leaving us with two large chunks our tiny butter knives were no match for.

The service from when you set foot in the hallway, to when you enter the dining area, to when you are seated and taken care of through your meal, to when you leave - *chef's kiss*. We were seated one table away from the window, which was a bummer but still got to enjoy the beautiful view unobstructed for an hour or so. The food we ordered was outstanding - some standouts include the steak and bone marrow mashed potatoes (soooooo delectable, so umami); the three shells appetizer (so many different options! All so fresh!); and the surprise chocolate cake dessert with happy birthday written on it at the end. What a romantic way to spend a birthday, and what a way to enjoy a Michelin-star eating experience. Would love to come back to try lunch here sometime in the future.Never thought I'd be writing a statement this lofty or ridiculous, but here we are: Never in all my years of going to nice restaurants, Michelin starred or otherwise, have I felt so disrespected. Let's get the good part over with first, since the list is short; the foie gras duet was excellent, and enough for two. The view, if you are lucky enough to get window seats, is also excellent. All the other dishes were sloppily executed; the duck was overcooked, the mushroom wellington underseasoned, and the dessert chestnut soufflé -- on boy, texture of vomit. I could barely eat two spoonfuls. If you are going to put a soufflé on your menu, Get. It. Right. The most infuriating part of the whole experience is how quickly the waitstaff profiles guests. From the moment we stepped into the restaurant -- to celebrate our anniversary, no less -- we were treated as second class citizens because of how we looked; and don't get me wrong, we were dressed appropriately for the restaurant. The hostess didn't even bother with niceties (such as a simple smile) and had us wait unnecessarily at the bar for ~15 minutes even though we were on time for our reservation; we were seated at the back of the restaurant and if you looked around, everyone else in that section were Asian -- coincidence? The universe is rarely so lazy. Service was slow and haphazard, and it showed right down to the execution of the food.But the crowning moment of all of this was when our server brought over our bill, looked at it, then sheepishly told us that she will take off the gratuity line they had sneakily included because they thought we were tourists. EXCUSE ME?! As a $$$$ establishment, you either go TIP FREE or you treat all your guests the same and allow them to make their own decisions; you DO NOT arbitrarily decide who looks like a tourist and who does not. For shame, River Café.Celebrated my mother's birthday here. Service was excellent and we felt very well taken care of. Wagyu steak tartare: absolutely delicious; would recommend 100%. I was a bit iffy trying raw beef but I'm glad I did!Mushroom Wellington: it was good, but I don't really think it's worth the price just for mushrooms and what's ultimately a bread coating outside. I would recommend the lobster instead.Brooklyn bridge cake: beautiful and the cake was delicious! However, I wish the chocolate they used for the bridge was milk instead of dark. Overall, the experience was great and the restaurant itself looked amazing. The only thing I wasn't happy about was being charged $20 for 2 bottles of water. Also, the cobblestone in the driveway made it hard to walk in heels.One of my fav restaurant in NYC, and I especially like the romantic restaurant which is decorated by flowers lol, also the dessert ""Brooklyn Bridge"" is definitely my fav one! hope the indoors dinning can open soon!!! Missing those cute restaurants so much!!!The perfect ambience with beautiful classical music the crisp water breeze and impeccable service and ingredients was found in this Covid environment at the River Café. Great for a date, anniversary, celebration - there was some thing about the magical allure of the candlelight lantern setting amidst a secret garden while simultaneously floating on the water with the entire Manhattan skyline looming in the back while Chopin and Vivaldi floated in the backdrop of the evening. The food was fixed price $125 per person and afforded the perfect amount of fullness and explosion of flavors.My favorite was the hearty shrimp appetizer We did sweet chili sauce and grilled corn mash and the black Seabass fillet even though the signature dish of the Branzino sea bass was deboned -much to my lazy delight And was feeling owing to it's toasted fried crumb topping as well as the shrimp Layer it was wrapped in.The desert Trio along with the four cookies was the perfect cap of the meal. My favorite personal dessert was the Brooklyn Bridge chocolate ganache tart on a bed of raspberry purée, but the light peach sorbet was almost bursting in its freshness and was a close second. Overall between service, ambience, food options, seafood options for my pescatarian Muslim palate, A new favorite is found in BrooklynA gem of NYC with a heart of gold. The River Cafe helped plan the most amazing wedding day imagined, in less than 3 weeks (you heard that right!). The team (from Alyson to the valet) went above and beyond to help make our special day unforgettable. All in a time of COVID. We were able to have the ceremony, cocktail hour and reception all outdoors - per federal and state guidelines. All the tables were socially distant and they provided the flexibility for family and friends to celebrate within their comfort level.The food - this was our first time here but if you read any credible review you know there is nothing like it. The views - just take a walk around the venue and see for yourself. Thank you River Cafe!Best parts of our dinner - great decor and location, friendly and funny waiter, attentive staff and service. For the price point, the overall experience was acceptable but I don't think I'd ever revisit, other than for the location. There are many restaurants with cheaper fixed price menus and better food. The best dish from our night was the octopus appetizer that we got. It's probably in the top octopus dishes I've ever had. Everything else was good but not amazing.Meh, I've been here before covid and it was good. Went today and they refused to sit me by the water because I wasn't a regular. I asked what it takes to be a regular and they said you need to eat here 40 years. F*ck that. I ate for 3 hours and only 2 of 5 water front spots were filled. To the snooty blonde lady they refused to let me eat by the water at tables that would go empty, screw you. I wont be back again. Why do do you treat non existent customers better than actual customers?Won't be back again. If you won't a special dinner, don't go here. Apparently they only care if you have been going 40 years years. To everyone else, pound sand.The River Café seeks to provide a best-in-class fine dining experience in one of the world's most beautiful settings. Regrettably, it fell well short of that standard on my recent visit. While the food was on par with expectation, a discerning customer will likely take exception to the service and overall experience. If you are hoping to create a perfect evening, you may wish to look elsewhere.After calling me twice to confirm my reservation and inquire about the special occasion of my visit - in both instances acknowledging my request for a table with a view - the Maître D' promptly led us to the far corner of the dining hall, about as far away from the window as possible. While I appreciate that seating requests cannot always be honored, I could not help but feel disappointed at one of the most unfortunately located tables in the house, especially at a time of 25% reduced capacity.Worse, however, was the seating arrangement. It is unclear to me why an establishment of renown would presume to seat a party of two directly next to one another instead of across. No, it was not Valentine's Day, and the restaurant knew I'd be dining with a senior family member because I had told them so twice (at their request, no less). It caused the Maître D' some embarrassment to admit no real alternative was available, and I was needlessly forced into being persistent to secure a different section of the corner wall. This, at least, offered an 'L' shaped arrangement such that my elderly mother didn't have to keep her head turned 90 degrees all evening to converse with me. I am reasonably certain the seating arrangement would have been the same had I been taking out a business partner or formal guest - a proposition I am now unlikely to pursue in the future.Despite the minor improvement, seating remained awkward. The vintage table lamps are cabled and plugged into outlets on the floor, leading to unnecessary interference with tableware and guests' legs. The clumsy table experience was further exacerbated by booth seating so tight you had to move the entire table every time someone stands up or sits down. Again, at 25% indoor dining capacity, I would have expected to feel less cramped. Dinner service was carried out by a round robin of waitstaff and bussers of which there were so many I lost track. This made the experience feel impersonal, confusing, and inefficient. Upon requesting a wine pairing in response to multiple inquiries about my drink order, I was repeatedly passed off to the sommelier, who either never arrived or failed to introduce himself as such. I'd like to believe he was never consulted, however, given I was initially offered the last bit of overly oxidized Chianti from a bottle that had clearly been open for too long. When I declined, the waiter was surprised to learn I was in fact having duck and not steak, as he had previously thought. What good is having a sommelier when a guest's dinner order is not properly communicated to them?Although the food was good, the gaffes continued: A dense loaf of bread served as a starter was only cut once through the middle, leaving us with two large chunks our tiny butter knives were no match for. The irony of being adamantly reminded about a restaurant's formal dress code in advance of my arrival, only to then be forced to work through a fistful of bread with my bare hands for lack of proper silverware, was certainly not lost on me.Far worse, however, was that we were not asked at any point during our evening whether we were enjoying our meal or needed anything else. While I share the waitstaffs faith in Chef Steelman, being Michelin starred does not absolve an establishment of its duty to uphold the most basic tenets of meal service. This was truly a faux pas and made me feel like a paying customer rather than a valued guest.Overall, the food was good, but the persistent undertow of disappointment and frustration took away substantially from what could and should have been a more enjoyable experience. While I may or may not return at some point in the future, I am for now left with the impression that The River Café takes itself a little too seriously given the actual standard to which it (under)performs on its promise of a true fine dining experience.This is second in a series retroacity reviews. What is a retroacity review you ask? It's restaurants that have held such an impact throughout the years that must receive a well-deserved review. We did visit not long ago, however the pictures are from a 2016 visit, since it provided the most memorable of experiences. Sheer elegance and extravagant venue are what comes to mind from this fine establishment. Every time we come I'm still amazed by the beauty of the vistas. The water glistening off our cityscape makes me proud to be a lifetime New Yorker. Refined etiquette is implemented by all staff from the coat room to the manager. The cuisine is always excellent, enhanced by the exquisite presentation. The River cafe experience never falters and is always excellent.I implore myself to make a visit to the River Cafe at least once a year. My wife always thanks me for a wonderful time at such an amorous setting. It has continued to live up to its reputation as one of the most romantic restaurants NYC has to offer.Rude arrogant staff , could've been better for the price, location and interior looks. Disappointed.Fantastic view, delicious food and good service. Everything you want and need in a romantic outing for any occasion.My wife and I wanted to celebrate our wedding anniversary somewhere special and, immediately, our very own borough's The River Cafe jumped to mind. Sure, there's plenty of romantic, beautiful, elegant, expensive restaurants in NYC to choose from, but it was somewhere we always wanted to dine at because of our familiarity with the restaurant ... and we practically passed by it every time while driving back into Brooklyn.There are many great things about The River Cafe, but before even dining here, people who do want to come here will love that they offer reservations 1 year in advance, which is awesome and rare. What's not awesome though is that the area that the restaurant is located in is tight and street parking is not always available, however the restaurant does offer free valet parking.We arrived for our 6pm reservation a bit earlier than we anticipated and were still seated immediately. If you do arrive early, I highly recommend taking advantage of the scenery and getting a few photos in before dining. At the time, the restaurant was relatively empty with the exception of a few parties being seated. When making our reservation, we had requested for a seat next to the window overlooking downtown Manhattan and we were glad to see that the restaurant obliged. The service throughout our meal was good, but a bit mistimed at moments as we were interrupted multiple times with questions while chewing our food. Nevertheless, it far from ruined our meal, but it was a bit awkward 2-3 times.The menu was pre-fixe style (appetizer, entree and dessert) at a set price and a bit extra for the chef's tasting menu. We had no intentions of dining for 3-4 hours, so we decided on making pre-fixe selections. My wife ordered the Sea Scallop and Pork Belly, Lobster and Hot Souffle, while I went with the Octopus, Crescent Farms Duck and Chocolate Brooklyn Bridge.First, we were greeted by a small Amuse-bouche, which was a nice touch to kick off our meals. Second, everything was delicious. We loved the food. Everything was as fresh as can be and well plated. The serving size for the duck was actually quite generous compared to everything else, but then again it might have been one of the less expensive options on the pre-fixe menu? In addition, we loved the extra touch the restaurant put on our desserts to wish us a happy anniversary, so do expect that if you mention you are coming here for an occasion.Everything was close to perfect except for the mistimed visits from the waiters. The food was excellent and the view was everything we thought it would be. What did surprise us though was that the restaurant got very crowded (on a Sunday evening) and the noise level really picked up just before we left. The dim lighting helped in creating a romantic atmosphere, but the amount of noise took a little bit of that away, so if you're looking for that romantic meal it might be ideal to come here for an early dinner before the restaurant gets overly packed.Five star all around...the location, the food, the service, the clientele, the atmosphere, the table settings, the flowers, the crockery, the cutlery, the pianist.... sublime.Came here for my husband's 70th bday, and we received plenty of happy birthday greetings aswell as a chocolate mini dessert plate, after our lunch. What a lovely touch.The views and location are phenomenal, it does not get better than this. For a special occasion this is the PLACE TO BE.Every detail is met, even crystallised salt on top of the personalised chilled butter. My fois gras was divine, smooth as silk.  The herb crust on the main of duck was also wonderful.A meal and memory to remember for ever.WOW I am so impressed with this place ! I celebrated my birthday here with my family and I loved every minute of it ! From the outstanding service , to the attention to detail , the view , the ambiance and the food everything was top notch ! I mean could you expect any less from a fine dinning establishment !! Honestly I thought people only came here for the view but the food was amazing . From the moment we sat down to the moment we left we were catered to . We sat outdoors and there were heat lamps and space heaters . We also felt pretty safe . The food was a 3 course prefixe meal for $130 ( not including tax and tip ) which included appetizer , entree and dessert . I've included pictures of each dish . The plates were small but surprisingly very filling ! We left completely satisfied and raving about our experience . Yes this is a splurge type of place but if you've got a special occasion definitely give it a try ! It's so beautiful ! Also definitely make a reservation or else you will not be seated .I booked a dinner reservation for Thursday night a week in advance. Upon arrival we were greeted and had  complimentary glasses of champagne due to having to wait almost in the rain (also I'm assuming for being newly engaged as I put in the reservation notes as well). It was POURING rain as thunderstorms were forecasted, but the way River Cafe was set up there was no problem having comfort for the patrons that went. It was STILL a packed house at 9 pm. Service was impeccable, attention to detail even though it was a packed house and there was a downpour, the waiters were attentive and had such a great attitude and friendly. My glass was never empty! The prefix meal that my fiancé and I had tasted so freaking great: appetizer shrimp and dumplings, the main course fiancé had risotto and I had duck, and the dessert was a mix of deserts cake shaped to look like Brooklyn bridge, sherbet, etc. Most importantly: the view. The view is incredible and beautiful and made the experience that much better. Thank you River Cafe to end the day to being newly engaged and making it more special!I love to come here to celebrate my Anniversary, service is outstanding from the beginning to end. The view is one of the most beautiful and romantics. Our food was delicious and perfectly presented. Love the signature Broolyn Bridge dessert, and they always take the time to congratulate us for our Anniversary.Went here for my husband's birthday and had a lovely time. It's definitely old school Italian (jackets required, for example) and the views are amazing. You can't request window seating in advance but the host/hostess does his/her best to accommodate. We actually ended up with an even better seat than directly next to the window, so both of us would have the view when facing forward. Plus the table offered more privacy than the window ones. I will say while the food was good, it didn't blow me away. You come here for the service, experience, the views and the bridge chocolate dessert! Worth visiting once as it's a bucket list entry.Came here for dinner on Sunday night with a group of 5 to celebrate a birthday and had a great time! Our waiter was very lively and knowledgeable about the menu. We did the prefix menu so we could choose an appetizer, main entrée and dessert. I got the pear salad, strip steak and hot souffle. Everything was delicious! Others at the table got oysters, octopus, lamb, and fish. Everyone was happy with their choices. The Brooklyn Bridge cake was a popular choice for dessert - very creative display!The dinner was definitely on the fancy/pricey side (men are required to wear jackets). The views are great and you feel like you are really on the water. The outside of the restaurant was really cute too. They had string lights all over a large patio garden. All of the staff was extremely friendly and welcoming without making the place feel too ""stuffy"". I would definitely recommend if you are looking to celebrate something and get dressed up.The area around the restaurant in DUMBO is really nice to walk around as well.  It is directly under the Brooklyn Bridge!This place is a fairytale! Absolutely amazing ambiance. From the music to the lights. If you are ever thinking of going, GO!! As for the food, it was also incredible. Everyone there was dressed up but there is no dress code (unless I missed it).Perfect restaurant to spend our anniversary! We had an early reservation at 5:30pm and arrived just before our table was ready. We were greeted at the door of our car with valet service who opened our doors and held umbrellas over our heads to ensure we weren't drenched by the rain. Little things like that make the experience perfect from the get go. We sat at the bar inside the restaurant and the bartender was very knowledgable about the menu. We wanted a bottle of champagne and he directed us to their Sommelier, who happened to be adorable. He not only knew the bottles well but he was excited about a couple of the choices. He pointed us in the direction of a bottle around $172, which was FANTASTIC. To be honest, I would have paid more for it because it couldn't have paired better with our dishes. Before the bottle was opened, our table was ready and it was right next to the window so we had a perfect view. We were able to see the Statue of Liberty, Brooklyn Bridge, and Manhattan. Perfect.Our server, Flavio, was exceptional and kind. He asked if we were celebrating anything and we told him it was our anniversary to which he told us a bit about himself. I love when servers at high-end restaurants aren't snooty and remain personable and kind. He was wonderful and I hope to have him again as our server.Food:*Appetizers*- Wild Shrimp: shrimp cooked to perfection and topped with crab, white asparagus, and a tasty sauce. I would order this again.- Foie Gras: the best I've had thus far in NY. It was prepared two ways, which made it a fun dish to try with my spouse. Served with two pieces of toasted bread. I would order this again.*Main Courses*- Lobster: this is the dish I should've ordered but I got a few bites! It was cooked perfectly and served with some sort of lobster salad on the side, which was to die for! This is the main course to order.- Black Sea Bass: this was my main course and I was very happy with it. I thought the stuffed asparagus was a nice addition and matched each bite of the sea bass. The 3 raviolis were phenomenal and I wish I could've had a few more.*Dessert*- Souffle: we both had the souflee, which was served with ice cream, and a piece of chocolate. Absolutely wonderful.Thank you for making our anniversary memorable. We hope to visit again before we leave.***Pre-COVID*** Came for my birthday dinner as a treat from the bf - definitely a special occasion kind of place. Honestly, what an experience. The location is outstanding: on the waterfront overlooking downtown Manhattan, with a cute little park in front that happened to be hosting a wedding when we walked by.

Nevertheless, it far from ruined our meal, but it was a bit awkward 2-3 times.The menu was pre-fixe style (appetizer, entree and dessert) at a set price and a bit extra for the chef's tasting menu. We had no intentions of dining for 3-4 hours, so we decided on making pre-fixe selections. My wife ordered the Sea Scallop and Pork Belly, Lobster and Hot Souffle, while I went with the Octopus, Crescent Farms Duck and Chocolate Brooklyn Bridge.First, we were greeted by a small Amuse-bouche, which was a nice touch to kick off our meals. Second, everything was delicious. We loved the food. Everything was as fresh as can be and well plated. The serving size for the duck was actually quite generous compared to everything else, but then again it might have been one of the less expensive options on the pre-fixe menu? In addition, we loved the extra touch the restaurant put on our desserts to wish us a happy anniversary, so do expect that if you mention you are coming here for an occasion.Everything was close to perfect except for the mistimed visits from the waiters. The food was excellent and the view was everything we thought it would be. What did surprise us though was that the restaurant got very crowded (on a Sunday evening) and the noise level really picked up just before we left. The dim lighting helped in creating a romantic atmosphere, but the amount of noise took a little bit of that away, so if you're looking for that romantic meal it might be ideal to come here for an early dinner before the restaurant gets overly packed.Five star all around...the location, the food, the service, the clientele, the atmosphere, the table settings, the flowers, the crockery, the cutlery, the pianist.... sublime.Came here for my husband's 70th bday, and we received plenty of happy birthday greetings aswell as a chocolate mini dessert plate, after our lunch. What a lovely touch.The views and location are phenomenal, it does not get better than this. For a special occasion this is the PLACE TO BE.Every detail is met, even crystallised salt on top of the personalised chilled butter. My fois gras was divine, smooth as silk.  The herb crust on the main of duck was also wonderful.A meal and memory to remember for ever.WOW I am so impressed with this place ! I celebrated my birthday here with my family and I loved every minute of it ! From the outstanding service , to the attention to detail , the view , the ambiance and the food everything was top notch ! I mean could you expect any less from a fine dinning establishment !! Honestly I thought people only came here for the view but the food was amazing . From the moment we sat down to the moment we left we were catered to . We sat outdoors and there were heat lamps and space heaters . We also felt pretty safe . The food was a 3 course prefixe meal for $130 ( not including tax and tip ) which included appetizer , entree and dessert . I've included pictures of each dish . The plates were small but surprisingly very filling ! We left completely satisfied and raving about our experience . Yes this is a splurge type of place but if you've got a special occasion definitely give it a try ! It's so beautiful ! Also definitely make a reservation or else you will not be seated .I booked a dinner reservation for Thursday night a week in advance. Upon arrival we were greeted and had  complimentary glasses of champagne due to having to wait almost in the rain (also I'm assuming for being newly engaged as I put in the reservation notes as well). It was POURING rain as thunderstorms were forecasted, but the way River Cafe was set up there was no problem having comfort for the patrons that went. It was STILL a packed house at 9 pm. Service was impeccable, attention to detail even though it was a packed house and there was a downpour, the waiters were attentive and had such a great attitude and friendly. My glass was never empty! The prefix meal that my fiancé and I had tasted so freaking great: appetizer shrimp and dumplings, the main course fiancé had risotto and I had duck, and the dessert was a mix of deserts cake shaped to look like Brooklyn bridge, sherbet, etc. Most importantly: the view. The view is incredible and beautiful and made the experience that much better. Thank you River Cafe to end the day to being newly engaged and making it more special!I love to come here to celebrate my Anniversary, service is outstanding from the beginning to end. The view is one of the most beautiful and romantics. Our food was delicious and perfectly presented. Love the signature Broolyn Bridge dessert, and they always take the time to congratulate us for our Anniversary.Went here for my husband's birthday and had a lovely time. It's definitely old school Italian (jackets required, for example) and the views are amazing. You can't request window seating in advance but the host/hostess does his/her best to accommodate. We actually ended up with an even better seat than directly next to the window, so both of us would have the view when facing forward. Plus the table offered more privacy than the window ones. I will say while the food was good, it didn't blow me away. You come here for the service, experience, the views and the bridge chocolate dessert! Worth visiting once as it's a bucket list entry.Came here for dinner on Sunday night with a group of 5 to celebrate a birthday and had a great time! Our waiter was very lively and knowledgeable about the menu. We did the prefix menu so we could choose an appetizer, main entrée and dessert. I got the pear salad, strip steak and hot souffle. Everything was delicious! Others at the table got oysters, octopus, lamb, and fish. Everyone was happy with their choices. The Brooklyn Bridge cake was a popular choice for dessert - very creative display!The dinner was definitely on the fancy/pricey side (men are required to wear jackets). The views are great and you feel like you are really on the water. The outside of the restaurant was really cute too. They had string lights all over a large patio garden. All of the staff was extremely friendly and welcoming without making the place feel too ""stuffy"". I would definitely recommend if you are looking to celebrate something and get dressed up.The area around the restaurant in DUMBO is really nice to walk around as well.  It is directly under the Brooklyn Bridge!This place is a fairytale! Absolutely amazing ambiance. From the music to the lights. If you are ever thinking of going, GO!! As for the food, it was also incredible. Everyone there was dressed up but there is no dress code (unless I missed it).Perfect restaurant to spend our anniversary! We had an early reservation at 5:30pm and arrived just before our table was ready. We were greeted at the door of our car with valet service who opened our doors and held umbrellas over our heads to ensure we weren't drenched by the rain. Little things like that make the experience perfect from the get go. We sat at the bar inside the restaurant and the bartender was very knowledgable about the menu. We wanted a bottle of champagne and he directed us to their Sommelier, who happened to be adorable. He not only knew the bottles well but he was excited about a couple of the choices. He pointed us in the direction of a bottle around $172, which was FANTASTIC. To be honest, I would have paid more for it because it couldn't have paired better with our dishes. Before the bottle was opened, our table was ready and it was right next to the window so we had a perfect view. We were able to see the Statue of Liberty, Brooklyn Bridge, and Manhattan. Perfect.Our server, Flavio, was exceptional and kind. He asked if we were celebrating anything and we told him it was our anniversary to which he told us a bit about himself. I love when servers at high-end restaurants aren't snooty and remain personable and kind. He was wonderful and I hope to have him again as our server.Food:*Appetizers*- Wild Shrimp: shrimp cooked to perfection and topped with crab, white asparagus, and a tasty sauce. I would order this again.- Foie Gras: the best I've had thus far in NY. It was prepared two ways, which made it a fun dish to try with my spouse. Served with two pieces of toasted bread. I would order this again.*Main Courses*- Lobster: this is the dish I should've ordered but I got a few bites! It was cooked perfectly and served with some sort of lobster salad on the side, which was to die for! This is the main course to order.- Black Sea Bass: this was my main course and I was very happy with it. I thought the stuffed asparagus was a nice addition and matched each bite of the sea bass. The 3 raviolis were phenomenal and I wish I could've had a few more.*Dessert*- Souffle: we both had the souflee, which was served with ice cream, and a piece of chocolate. Absolutely wonderful.Thank you for making our anniversary memorable. We hope to visit again before we leave.***Pre-COVID*** Came for my birthday dinner as a treat from the bf - definitely a special occasion kind of place. Honestly, what an experience. The location is outstanding: on the waterfront overlooking downtown Manhattan, with a cute little park in front that happened to be hosting a wedding when we walked by. The service from when you set foot in the hallway, to when you enter the dining area, to when you are seated and taken care of through your meal, to when you leave - *chef's kiss*. We were seated one table away from the window, which was a bummer but still got to enjoy the beautiful view unobstructed for an hour or so. The food we ordered was outstanding - some standouts include the steak and bone marrow mashed potatoes (soooooo delectable, so umami); the three shells appetizer (so many different options! All so fresh!); and the surprise chocolate cake dessert with happy birthday written on it at the end. What a romantic way to spend a birthday, and what a way to enjoy a Michelin-star eating experience. Would love to come back to try lunch here sometime in the future.Never thought I'd be writing a statement this lofty or ridiculous, but here we are: Never in all my years of going to nice restaurants, Michelin starred or otherwise, have I felt so disrespected. Let's get the good part over with first, since the list is short; the foie gras duet was excellent, and enough for two. The view, if you are lucky enough to get window seats, is also excellent. All the other dishes were sloppily executed; the duck was overcooked, the mushroom wellington underseasoned, and the dessert chestnut soufflé -- on boy, texture of vomit. I could barely eat two spoonfuls. If you are going to put a soufflé on your menu, Get. It. Right. The most infuriating part of the whole experience is how quickly the waitstaff profiles guests. From the moment we stepped into the restaurant -- to celebrate our anniversary, no less -- we were treated as second class citizens because of how we looked; and don't get me wrong, we were dressed appropriately for the restaurant. The hostess didn't even bother with niceties (such as a simple smile) and had us wait unnecessarily at the bar for ~15 minutes even though we were on time for our reservation; we were seated at the back of the restaurant and if you looked around, everyone else in that section were Asian -- coincidence? The universe is rarely so lazy. Service was slow and haphazard, and it showed right down to the execution of the food.But the crowning moment of all of this was when our server brought over our bill, looked at it, then sheepishly told us that she will take off the gratuity line they had sneakily included because they thought we were tourists. EXCUSE ME?! As a $$$$ establishment, you either go TIP FREE or you treat all your guests the same and allow them to make their own decisions; you DO NOT arbitrarily decide who looks like a tourist and who does not. For shame, River Café.Celebrated my mother's birthday here. Service was excellent and we felt very well taken care of. Wagyu steak tartare: absolutely delicious; would recommend 100%. I was a bit iffy trying raw beef but I'm glad I did!Mushroom Wellington: it was good, but I don't really think it's worth the price just for mushrooms and what's ultimately a bread coating outside. I would recommend the lobster instead.Brooklyn bridge cake: beautiful and the cake was delicious! However, I wish the chocolate they used for the bridge was milk instead of dark. Overall, the experience was great and the restaurant itself looked amazing. The only thing I wasn't happy about was being charged $20 for 2 bottles of water. Also, the cobblestone in the driveway made it hard to walk in heels.One of my fav restaurant in NYC, and I especially like the romantic restaurant which is decorated by flowers lol, also the dessert ""Brooklyn Bridge"" is definitely my fav one! hope the indoors dinning can open soon!!! Missing those cute restaurants so much!!!The perfect ambience with beautiful classical music the crisp water breeze and impeccable service and ingredients was found in this Covid environment at the River Café. Great for a date, anniversary, celebration - there was some thing about the magical allure of the candlelight lantern setting amidst a secret garden while simultaneously floating on the water with the entire Manhattan skyline looming in the back while Chopin and Vivaldi floated in the backdrop of the evening. The food was fixed price $125 per person and afforded the perfect amount of fullness and explosion of flavors.My favorite was the hearty shrimp appetizer We did sweet chili sauce and grilled corn mash and the black Seabass fillet even though the signature dish of the Branzino sea bass was deboned -much to my lazy delight And was feeling owing to it's toasted fried crumb topping as well as the shrimp Layer it was wrapped in.The desert Trio along with the four cookies was the perfect cap of the meal. My favorite personal dessert was the Brooklyn Bridge chocolate ganache tart on a bed of raspberry purée, but the light peach sorbet was almost bursting in its freshness and was a close second. Overall between service, ambience, food options, seafood options for my pescatarian Muslim palate, A new favorite is found in BrooklynA gem of NYC with a heart of gold. The River Cafe helped plan the most amazing wedding day imagined, in less than 3 weeks (you heard that right!). The team (from Alyson to the valet) went above and beyond to help make our special day unforgettable. All in a time of COVID. We were able to have the ceremony, cocktail hour and reception all outdoors - per federal and state guidelines. All the tables were socially distant and they provided the flexibility for family and friends to celebrate within their comfort level.The food - this was our first time here but if you read any credible review you know there is nothing like it. The views - just take a walk around the venue and see for yourself. Thank you River Cafe!Best parts of our dinner - great decor and location, friendly and funny waiter, attentive staff and service. For the price point, the overall experience was acceptable but I don't think I'd ever revisit, other than for the location. There are many restaurants with cheaper fixed price menus and better food. The best dish from our night was the octopus appetizer that we got. It's probably in the top octopus dishes I've ever had. Everything else was good but not amazing.Meh, I've been here before covid and it was good. Went today and they refused to sit me by the water because I wasn't a regular. I asked what it takes to be a regular and they said you need to eat here 40 years. F*ck that. I ate for 3 hours and only 2 of 5 water front spots were filled. To the snooty blonde lady they refused to let me eat by the water at tables that would go empty, screw you. I wont be back again. Why do do you treat non existent customers better than actual customers?Won't be back again. If you won't a special dinner, don't go here. Apparently they only care if you have been going 40 years years. To everyone else, pound sand.The River Café seeks to provide a best-in-class fine dining experience in one of the world's most beautiful settings. Regrettably, it fell well short of that standard on my recent visit. While the food was on par with expectation, a discerning customer will likely take exception to the service and overall experience. If you are hoping to create a perfect evening, you may wish to look elsewhere.After calling me twice to confirm my reservation and inquire about the special occasion of my visit - in both instances acknowledging my request for a table with a view - the Maître D' promptly led us to the far corner of the dining hall, about as far away from the window as possible. While I appreciate that seating requests cannot always be honored, I could not help but feel disappointed at one of the most unfortunately located tables in the house, especially at a time of 25% reduced capacity.Worse, however, was the seating arrangement. It is unclear to me why an establishment of renown would presume to seat a party of two directly next to one another instead of across. No, it was not Valentine's Day, and the restaurant knew I'd be dining with a senior family member because I had told them so twice (at their request, no less). It caused the Maître D' some embarrassment to admit no real alternative was available, and I was needlessly forced into being persistent to secure a different section of the corner wall. This, at least, offered an 'L' shaped arrangement such that my elderly mother didn't have to keep her head turned 90 degrees all evening to converse with me. I am reasonably certain the seating arrangement would have been the same had I been taking out a business partner or formal guest - a proposition I am now unlikely to pursue in the future.Despite the minor improvement, seating remained awkward. The vintage table lamps are cabled and plugged into outlets on the floor, leading to unnecessary interference with tableware and guests' legs. The clumsy table experience was further exacerbated by booth seating so tight you had to move the entire table every time someone stands up or sits down. Again, at 25% indoor dining capacity, I would have expected to feel less cramped. Dinner service was carried out by a round robin of waitstaff and bussers of which there were so many I lost track. This made the experience feel impersonal, confusing, and inefficient. Upon requesting a wine pairing in response to multiple inquiries about my drink order, I was repeatedly passed off to the sommelier, who either never arrived or failed to introduce himself as such. I'd like to believe he was never consulted, however, given I was initially offered the last bit of overly oxidized Chianti from a bottle that had clearly been open for too long. When I declined, the waiter was surprised to learn I was in fact having duck and not steak, as he had previously thought. What good is having a sommelier when a guest's dinner order is not properly communicated to them?Although the food was good, the gaffes continued: A dense loaf of bread served as a starter was only cut once through the middle, leaving us with two large chunks our tiny butter knives were no match for. The irony of being adamantly reminded about a restaurant's formal dress code in advance of my arrival, only to then be forced to work through a fistful of bread with my bare hands for lack of proper silverware, was certainly not lost on me.Far worse, however, was that we were not asked at any point during our evening whether we were enjoying our meal or needed anything else. While I share the waitstaffs faith in Chef Steelman, being Michelin starred does not absolve an establishment of its duty to uphold the most basic tenets of meal service. This was truly a faux pas and made me feel like a paying customer rather than a valued guest.Overall, the food was good, but the persistent undertow of disappointment and frustration took away substantially from what could and should have been a more enjoyable experience. While I may or may not return at some point in the future, I am for now left with the impression that The River Café takes itself a little too seriously given the actual standard to which it (under)performs on its promise of a true fine dining experience.This is second in a series retroacity reviews. What is a retroacity review you ask? It's restaurants that have held such an impact throughout the years that must receive a well-deserved review. We did visit not long ago, however the pictures are from a 2016 visit, since it provided the most memorable of experiences. Sheer elegance and extravagant venue are what comes to mind from this fine establishment. Every time we come I'm still amazed by the beauty of the vistas. The water glistening off our cityscape makes me proud to be a lifetime New Yorker. Refined etiquette is implemented by all staff from the coat room to the manager. The cuisine is always excellent, enhanced by the exquisite presentation. The River cafe experience never falters and is always excellent.I implore myself to make a visit to the River Cafe at least once a year. My wife always thanks me for a wonderful time at such an amorous setting. It has continued to live up to its reputation as one of the most romantic restaurants NYC has to offer.Rude arrogant staff , could've been better for the price, location and interior looks. Disappointed.Fantastic view, delicious food and good service. Everything you want and need in a romantic outing for any occasion.My wife and I wanted to celebrate our wedding anniversary somewhere special and, immediately, our very own borough's The River Cafe jumped to mind. Sure, there's plenty of romantic, beautiful, elegant, expensive restaurants in NYC to choose from, but it was somewhere we always wanted to dine at because of our familiarity with the restaurant ... and we practically passed by it every time while driving back into Brooklyn.There are many great things about The River Cafe, but before even dining here, people who do want to come here will love that they offer reservations 1 year in advance, which is awesome and rare. What's not awesome though is that the area that the restaurant is located in is tight and street parking is not always available, however the restaurant does offer free valet parking.We arrived for our 6pm reservation a bit earlier than we anticipated and were still seated immediately. If you do arrive early, I highly recommend taking advantage of the scenery and getting a few photos in before dining. At the time, the restaurant was relatively empty with the exception of a few parties being seated. When making our reservation, we had requested for a seat next to the window overlooking downtown Manhattan and we were glad to see that the restaurant obliged. The service throughout our meal was good, but a bit mistimed at moments as we were interrupted multiple times with questions while chewing our food.

In addition, we loved the extra touch the restaurant put on our desserts to wish us a happy anniversary, so do expect that if you mention you are coming here for an occasion.Everything was close to perfect except for the mistimed visits from the waiters. The food was excellent and the view was everything we thought it would be. What did surprise us though was that the restaurant got very crowded (on a Sunday evening) and the noise level really picked up just before we left.

Know that the food is all locally sourced from different farms was a great touch The food was really fresh and each dish had a unique delicious taste The cocktails were also wonderful The menu changes seasonally but you really can't go wrong here ! Looking forward to returning here very soonTook a while but finally made it over to Colonie to see for myself what's going on.Meal?Sunday brunchNumber of people in our party?Table for twoOutdoor Seating?Yes - sidewalk and street seating. Socially distanced tables with room for approximately 30 people in total. Most tables are fully covered with large, outdoor umbrellas or outdoor tenting. The space is thoughtfully sectioned off from the street with window boxes.What'd we order to eat?*Turkish Eggs *Cacio e Pepe ScrambleWhat'd we order to drink?*Bloody Mary*Last Word*Iced Coffee*Chili Margarita (x2)Things to note?*nice staff*small portions*must wear masks when ordering*small menu*masks and hand sanitizer available*staff adheres to all COVID-related guidelinesThe Turkish Eggs had incredible flavor - the dish itself is beautifully displayed and is accompanied by 4 pieces of toasted bread for dipping. This was by far the standout of the meal - it was outstanding and could have easily eaten two servings of this. The Cacio e Pepe got a thumbs up from my friend.The Bloody Mary was eh... and not as described on the menu, aka - it was missing some stuff. Very average and could have used more flavor - aside from ONE piece of lemon, there were no garnishes to be found anywhere; no olive, no celery no flavored rim, etc. Give that cocktail some TLC! After that, I switched to the Last Word, which was a better choice. The Chili Margarita was also tasty and their iced coffee had some strength to it -  it's served in a pint glass.When we sat down, I overheard one of the staff speaking with a customer about this being their first day open for brunch and it's not yet been advertised just yet, however, they have been open for dinner. The overall experience was good and the vibe was right. Yes, I'd go back but for dinner.I have ordered Turkish egg I must say the food quality was good unfortunately thats the only good thing I can say about the place.Slow service took them over 45 min to serve our food when the place was far of being full.The portion are super small and expensive.Luckily, Colonie has stayed open though the beginning of the Covid craziness. I came by on a Saturday for brunch with a friend.We had the entire bar-like table under the living wall all to ourselves. I ordered a hot coffee (French press) and a blood orange chili margarita. The French press coffee was SO delicious. But - it barely filled my mug and I wish there was a bit more coffee. The margarita was super delicious and I wholeheartedly recommend.My friend and I shared a bunch of plates - the cacio e pepe scramble, the Turkish eggs, the biscuits, and the home fries with aioli. The star of all of this was definitely the Turkish eggs. Everything about this dish is delicious and it's a must order. The cacio e Pepe was a perfect soft scramble and a really delicious dish and for someone wanting perfect simple eggs. The aioli in the home friends had a very intense orange flavor which was just ok for me. The biscuits were stunning, but the flavor was a little too eggy for me. I loved the preserves, and the orange zest really worked.The Turkish eggs are an absolute must with the cacio e Pepe scramble coming in as a close second. I need to get back and try those doughnuts!i was here five years ago and I passed by it recently wanting to try it again. We didn't end up getting a lot of food just an appetizer and some wine because the timing was tough.The server couldn't of been nicer she let us drive all the lines we wanted to before we decided on which one was right. She was helpful and I wish I got her name so I could shower her out here but she has curly hair and was super sweet.The five stars is for the mushroom pate. Make sure you eat it with the Meyer lemon slice (don't take it off). One of the best things I've eaten this year and I've had a lot of tasty items this year. I also loved and would get the Turkish eggs (who knew yogurt would be a winning combo with chili oil and eggs) again and again - if only this place was closer to me and didn't require a wait! Would rinse/repeat these two items till I got sick of them. The pancake is unique - more of a cake to be honest. It was tasty but not what I was looking for. I prefer my pancakes flatter and more dense....coffee is also pretty meh. Get cold brew bc hot coffee - despite being served in a cute French press - was not enjoyable (pretty sour/acidic...too much so for me even with milk added).Brunch review only!We came here on a Sunday around 12:30 and didn't have trouble finding a spot for the 2 of us. We sat at the open kitchen, which was great to see all the dishes being made! Also helped in our decision making since most of the pictures on Yelp were for dinner.We ended up getting the cherry salad, turkish eggs, oysters, and donuts.- Cherry salad: very light and refreshing with prosciutto, manchego and mint! The cherries are a bit tart but still refreshing and sweet! It paired really well the cheese and prosciutto. I thought this was a good combo to the heavier egg dish we shared- Turkish eggs: my first time trying this! It's basically poached eggs, yogurt, and brown butter sauce with fresh dill and spices! SO good! It comes with a side of freshly fired bread. Mix it all up, dip your bread in, and hellooo flavors! We liked it so much, we were inspired to make it at home!- Donuts: we were immediately tempted to get this when we saw it on the menu. The donuts are more on the cakey side, so don't expect airy/fluffy. But flavors are bomb. It also comes with this creamy light lemon sauce that I couldn't stop eating! I'm glad we ended up coming here because I was a littttle skeptical when I first saw the menu and wasn't that impressed. But I was so surprised and can't wait to return!Pesto Bianco...is..back people If you know anything about Brooklyn heights, you know there are several restaurants in a 4 block radius and many of which are your general Thai, Mediterranean, or Sushi restaurants. If you live here, you also know how difficult it is to get your Manhattan friends to make the journey. I'm happy to announce Colonie is golden ticket we've all been waiting for. Firstly, sit at the chefs table. Watching the chefs work their magic is incredible (shout out to Kone (sp) on the pasta. They put so much TLC in their food it really is a treat to watch. All of their drinks are delicious, I especially favor the detox retox, and cuc cocktail. The apps are also fantastic I would recommend 1 per person. Everything is fantastic, esp the sweet potatoes, Brussels (shaved and light not fried) and sunchokes. For dinner- get the spaghettoni. The pesto blanco is almond based and has a spicy after taste. I could eat this for every meal for the rest of my life. It can be made vegan or they can make it into a cheesy delight of that's what you're into. Everything here is A++++, but just expect a $100 for a partyTOP TEN BRUNCH SPOTS IN BK...I've been coming to Colonie for years for breakfast. Their food has always been consistently delicious. Their ambience gets 5 out of 5 stars as well. I always opt to sit at the ""bar"". I love an open concept kitchen. Literally everything is good here. Always come with a big appetite and a few ppl so you can order everything and share. Customer service is always on point. A true gem of Atlantic Avenue, nestled in the back of the main road of the Barclays Center,  walking distance to Brooklyn Bridge Park.It's been a while since I wrote a review but I just wrapped up dinner at Colonie and the experience was so fantastic that I couldn't not write one!Colonie had the trifecta that I'm always looking for --amazing service, food and ambience! From the minute we walked in the host was so warm and welcoming. I was holding flowers and a wet umbrella but needed to run to the restroom and he took both from me while I did that. He was willing to seat me while we waited for the rest of my party (I love when restaurant s don't make you wait for everyone even if you have a reservation). The service continued to be fantastic throughout the meal-- our server was also really nice, gave good recommendations and didn't rush us. The team of servers supporting our table was attentive and quickly took away plates, changed out silverware, etc. and overall worked seamlessly together.Next was the food; we ordered the crudo, burrata, cauliflower, lamb belly, pork chops, and artic char. For desert we had the blueberry sorbet and the sticky date cake. EVERYTHING  was beautifully presented, light and flavorful. Standouts include the burrata which came with charred bread and to my surprise the char went perfectly with the light burrata and it's shaved pickled celery. The lamb belly is a MUST GET, pressed into a square shape like pork belly and crisped on the outside with a mint sauce drizzle it was so flavorful. My husband got it and I was jealous! The cauliflower was also so flavorful-- it came with fresh mint, a mint sauce, pomegranate and fried shallots. The sticky date dessert was amazing -- warm, sweet came paired with ice cream! I wanted a second order of it! My artic char was cooked perfectly. The crudo was light but had a little too much fresh oregano for me. For ambience, the venue is nicely decorated, not overly done, dark wood, plants and clean. Whoever was in charge of music, they get a thumbs up! The music was a great mix of oldies, r&b and a little lover's rock. Great vibe! The team was also diverse from the chefs to the servers and I appreciated that.They are open late too which will make this one of my new go to spots for date night!Been here twice for brunch and blown away each time.  Donuts and monkey bread go well with French press coffee to start. Ricotta is smooth and lemony - goes well with toasted bread!  Shrimp and grits always good. Turkish eggs truly unique and flavorful!  Sunchokes are potatoes make for good sides!  Best of all - we got to sit at one of the corner tables in the front for a sun drenched brunch!I love brunch spots like this. Warm and chill vibe, with amazing food. The scramble was so good, blended with different cheeses and lightly cooked. Potatoes were a bit tangy, with crispy skin and the perfect seasoning. That date cake was literally the best thing I've had the last month. Moist, warm, and a perfect balance of flavor between dates and the melted caramel on it. The ice cream really topped it off. I have nothing but compliments for Colonie and wish I had discovered it earlier. Definitely my new neighborhood favorite. 5 stars from meIt was a little difficult getting a reservation at Colonie. We made a reservation about a week in advance and got a reservation for 9:30pm on a Saturday night. Even with a reservation, we still had to wait 15-20 minutes for our table to be ready. We started out with some drinks. I had the ""Cool Hand Cuke,"" a cucumber and elderflower drink. It was sweet (but not too sweet). I love cucumber in drinks and was not disappointed. For food, the cauliflower dish and snapper crudo caught my eye. Was a little disappointed with the cauliflower dish. There was nothing special about the flavors in the dish and it was too salty for me. However, I LOVED the snapper crudo. The flavor from the coconut milk was so interesting and suited the fish perfectly. It was definitely a novel taste to me and so delicious. Would strongly recommend the snapper crudo. Taste | 4Atmosphere | 4Presentation | 4Service | 4OVERALL | 4Colonie has fabulous food, terrific servers, wonderful ambience and is allergen friendly! I love eating there as it's excellent food and safe for me to eat.We did not have reservations but for a group of 3 we were able to grab a seat along the side bar. Our waiter was very friendly and was very knowledge about the menu. We started with the buttermilk biscuits that came with jam and butter. The jam was sooooooo good. Wow. I thiiiink it was blackberry jam. It was delicious with the biscuits. They were warm and very dense. The outside top part was slightly flakey. Look, just get it. You're welcome. Two of us got the Turkish Eggs and it was such a nice change from what I normally get when I go to brunch. The poached eggs were nice and runny. It sits on top of some Turkish yogurt covered in oil. You can see and taste the chili peppers and garlic and it will linger so maybe have a gum after lol. But it's totally worth it.  It also comes with a side of bread you can dip in there and eat with the eggs. My only issue with the bread was the taste of ash. The Burrata was also delicious and worth trying.I think this is cool spot to visit for brunch.Cute local neighborhood bar with strong drinks and good dessert. The sticky date cake is a must! I'm a very picky eater and not really the one to try new things but this cake was delicious it tasted like chocolate cake but better. Great service and good vibes. Will definitely returnI came here for a brunch during the weekend and overall had an ok experience. They do not take reservations so we were waiting by the door a little before opening time and was able to get the table. Here is the breakdown FoodThe food was ok in my books, very elaborated plates but the flavor factor wasn't there at least for my palette. I ordered the duck confit hash and the house potatoes. My friend ordered the biscuit sandwich-- the biscuit was delicious. Decor/ Ambiance Nice, cutesy rustic modern look. We seat at the chef's table and it was very nice to see them prepare the dishes right in front of you. Nice and lively house music. ServiceThe waiters were friendly. It was busy and they were training their best to be as attentive as they could.Overall Had an ok experience. Great vibe, the food was just not for me. But it might be for you, so still try it.The ambiance and food was tasty. The service was great. The food presentation was just as you see on a food show. I ordered the lamb & eggs which was delicious. It reminded me more of a dish I would eat in the fall though - it reminded me of a chilli. There were many chunks of lamb and the sauce was quite yummy. I sampled my friends shrimp & grits, which I liked as well. It was adorned with huge gulf shrimp and mushroom garnish. She also ordered a side of sausage - personal favorite! The cava was perfect. The Coffee & Cigarettes was just ok to me. It is an ideal blend of tequila and coffee, but not the taste I was shooting for. The table next to me ordered the pancakes, which look like a big cake (I thought it was a desert). I would definitely try them next time and share because it's massive.Really impressed by the food here. We got the corn with goat milk butter  for appetizer and it was very tasty. For main we got the blue crab pasta and the simple spaghetti. The spaghetti is like the cheapest pasta on the menu but it was absolutely stunning. The pasta is very thick and chewy and the sauce with almond and lemon with a hint of spiciness was just perfect. Also got the sticky date cake for dessert. Now I'm trying to make a date cake myself too... Love this neighborhood jam!So awesome! Went for brunch and the Turkish eggs and donuts with lemon cream were as good as it gets. Cool vibe and good service, though the chef does not do substitutions.

I came by on a Saturday for brunch with a friend.We had the entire bar-like table under the living wall all to ourselves. I ordered a hot coffee (French press) and a blood orange chili margarita. The French press coffee was SO delicious. But - it barely filled my mug and I wish there was a bit more coffee. The margarita was super delicious and I wholeheartedly recommend.My friend and I shared a bunch of plates - the cacio e pepe scramble, the Turkish eggs, the biscuits, and the home fries with aioli. The star of all of this was definitely the Turkish eggs. Everything about this dish is delicious and it's a must order. The cacio e Pepe was a perfect soft scramble and a really delicious dish and for someone wanting perfect simple eggs. The aioli in the home friends had a very intense orange flavor which was just ok for me. The biscuits were stunning, but the flavor was a little too eggy for me. I loved the preserves, and the orange zest really worked.The Turkish eggs are an absolute must with the cacio e Pepe scramble coming in as a close second. I need to get back and try those doughnuts!i was here five years ago and I passed by it recently wanting to try it again. We didn't end up getting a lot of food just an appetizer and some wine because the timing was tough.The server couldn't of been nicer she let us drive all the lines we wanted to before we decided on which one was right. She was helpful and I wish I got her name so I could shower her out here but she has curly hair and was super sweet.The five stars is for the mushroom pate. Make sure you eat it with the Meyer lemon slice (don't take it off). One of the best things I've eaten this year and I've had a lot of tasty items this year. I also loved and would get the Turkish eggs (who knew yogurt would be a winning combo with chili oil and eggs) again and again - if only this place was closer to me and didn't require a wait! Would rinse/repeat these two items till I got sick of them. The pancake is unique - more of a cake to be honest. It was tasty but not what I was looking for. I prefer my pancakes flatter and more dense....coffee is also pretty meh. Get cold brew bc hot coffee - despite being served in a cute French press - was not enjoyable (pretty sour/acidic...too much so for me even with milk added).Brunch review only!We came here on a Sunday around 12:30 and didn't have trouble finding a spot for the 2 of us. We sat at the open kitchen, which was great to see all the dishes being made! Also helped in our decision making since most of the pictures on Yelp were for dinner.We ended up getting the cherry salad, turkish eggs, oysters, and donuts.- Cherry salad: very light and refreshing with prosciutto, manchego and mint! The cherries are a bit tart but still refreshing and sweet! It paired really well the cheese and prosciutto. I thought this was a good combo to the heavier egg dish we shared- Turkish eggs: my first time trying this! It's basically poached eggs, yogurt, and brown butter sauce with fresh dill and spices! SO good! It comes with a side of freshly fired bread. Mix it all up, dip your bread in, and hellooo flavors! We liked it so much, we were inspired to make it at home!- Donuts: we were immediately tempted to get this when we saw it on the menu. The donuts are more on the cakey side, so don't expect airy/fluffy. But flavors are bomb. It also comes with this creamy light lemon sauce that I couldn't stop eating! I'm glad we ended up coming here because I was a littttle skeptical when I first saw the menu and wasn't that impressed. But I was so surprised and can't wait to return!Pesto Bianco...is..back people If you know anything about Brooklyn heights, you know there are several restaurants in a 4 block radius and many of which are your general Thai, Mediterranean, or Sushi restaurants. If you live here, you also know how difficult it is to get your Manhattan friends to make the journey. I'm happy to announce Colonie is golden ticket we've all been waiting for. Firstly, sit at the chefs table. Watching the chefs work their magic is incredible (shout out to Kone (sp) on the pasta. They put so much TLC in their food it really is a treat to watch. All of their drinks are delicious, I especially favor the detox retox, and cuc cocktail. The apps are also fantastic I would recommend 1 per person. Everything is fantastic, esp the sweet potatoes, Brussels (shaved and light not fried) and sunchokes. For dinner- get the spaghettoni. The pesto blanco is almond based and has a spicy after taste. I could eat this for every meal for the rest of my life. It can be made vegan or they can make it into a cheesy delight of that's what you're into. Everything here is A++++, but just expect a $100 for a partyTOP TEN BRUNCH SPOTS IN BK...I've been coming to Colonie for years for breakfast. Their food has always been consistently delicious. Their ambience gets 5 out of 5 stars as well. I always opt to sit at the ""bar"". I love an open concept kitchen. Literally everything is good here. Always come with a big appetite and a few ppl so you can order everything and share. Customer service is always on point. A true gem of Atlantic Avenue, nestled in the back of the main road of the Barclays Center,  walking distance to Brooklyn Bridge Park.It's been a while since I wrote a review but I just wrapped up dinner at Colonie and the experience was so fantastic that I couldn't not write one!Colonie had the trifecta that I'm always looking for --amazing service, food and ambience! From the minute we walked in the host was so warm and welcoming. I was holding flowers and a wet umbrella but needed to run to the restroom and he took both from me while I did that. He was willing to seat me while we waited for the rest of my party (I love when restaurant s don't make you wait for everyone even if you have a reservation). The service continued to be fantastic throughout the meal-- our server was also really nice, gave good recommendations and didn't rush us. The team of servers supporting our table was attentive and quickly took away plates, changed out silverware, etc. and overall worked seamlessly together.Next was the food; we ordered the crudo, burrata, cauliflower, lamb belly, pork chops, and artic char. For desert we had the blueberry sorbet and the sticky date cake. EVERYTHING  was beautifully presented, light and flavorful. Standouts include the burrata which came with charred bread and to my surprise the char went perfectly with the light burrata and it's shaved pickled celery. The lamb belly is a MUST GET, pressed into a square shape like pork belly and crisped on the outside with a mint sauce drizzle it was so flavorful. My husband got it and I was jealous! The cauliflower was also so flavorful-- it came with fresh mint, a mint sauce, pomegranate and fried shallots. The sticky date dessert was amazing -- warm, sweet came paired with ice cream! I wanted a second order of it! My artic char was cooked perfectly. The crudo was light but had a little too much fresh oregano for me. For ambience, the venue is nicely decorated, not overly done, dark wood, plants and clean. Whoever was in charge of music, they get a thumbs up! The music was a great mix of oldies, r&b and a little lover's rock. Great vibe! The team was also diverse from the chefs to the servers and I appreciated that.They are open late too which will make this one of my new go to spots for date night!Been here twice for brunch and blown away each time.  Donuts and monkey bread go well with French press coffee to start. Ricotta is smooth and lemony - goes well with toasted bread!  Shrimp and grits always good. Turkish eggs truly unique and flavorful!  Sunchokes are potatoes make for good sides!  Best of all - we got to sit at one of the corner tables in the front for a sun drenched brunch!I love brunch spots like this. Warm and chill vibe, with amazing food. The scramble was so good, blended with different cheeses and lightly cooked. Potatoes were a bit tangy, with crispy skin and the perfect seasoning. That date cake was literally the best thing I've had the last month. Moist, warm, and a perfect balance of flavor between dates and the melted caramel on it. The ice cream really topped it off. I have nothing but compliments for Colonie and wish I had discovered it earlier. Definitely my new neighborhood favorite. 5 stars from meIt was a little difficult getting a reservation at Colonie. We made a reservation about a week in advance and got a reservation for 9:30pm on a Saturday night. Even with a reservation, we still had to wait 15-20 minutes for our table to be ready. We started out with some drinks. I had the ""Cool Hand Cuke,"" a cucumber and elderflower drink. It was sweet (but not too sweet). I love cucumber in drinks and was not disappointed. For food, the cauliflower dish and snapper crudo caught my eye. Was a little disappointed with the cauliflower dish. There was nothing special about the flavors in the dish and it was too salty for me. However, I LOVED the snapper crudo. The flavor from the coconut milk was so interesting and suited the fish perfectly. It was definitely a novel taste to me and so delicious. Would strongly recommend the snapper crudo. Taste | 4Atmosphere | 4Presentation | 4Service | 4OVERALL | 4Colonie has fabulous food, terrific servers, wonderful ambience and is allergen friendly! I love eating there as it's excellent food and safe for me to eat.We did not have reservations but for a group of 3 we were able to grab a seat along the side bar. Our waiter was very friendly and was very knowledge about the menu. We started with the buttermilk biscuits that came with jam and butter. The jam was sooooooo good. Wow. I thiiiink it was blackberry jam. It was delicious with the biscuits. They were warm and very dense. The outside top part was slightly flakey. Look, just get it. You're welcome. Two of us got the Turkish Eggs and it was such a nice change from what I normally get when I go to brunch. The poached eggs were nice and runny. It sits on top of some Turkish yogurt covered in oil. You can see and taste the chili peppers and garlic and it will linger so maybe have a gum after lol. But it's totally worth it.  It also comes with a side of bread you can dip in there and eat with the eggs. My only issue with the bread was the taste of ash. The Burrata was also delicious and worth trying.I think this is cool spot to visit for brunch.Cute local neighborhood bar with strong drinks and good dessert. The sticky date cake is a must! I'm a very picky eater and not really the one to try new things but this cake was delicious it tasted like chocolate cake but better. Great service and good vibes. Will definitely returnI came here for a brunch during the weekend and overall had an ok experience. They do not take reservations so we were waiting by the door a little before opening time and was able to get the table. Here is the breakdown FoodThe food was ok in my books, very elaborated plates but the flavor factor wasn't there at least for my palette. I ordered the duck confit hash and the house potatoes. My friend ordered the biscuit sandwich-- the biscuit was delicious. Decor/ Ambiance Nice, cutesy rustic modern look. We seat at the chef's table and it was very nice to see them prepare the dishes right in front of you. Nice and lively house music. ServiceThe waiters were friendly. It was busy and they were training their best to be as attentive as they could.Overall Had an ok experience. Great vibe, the food was just not for me. But it might be for you, so still try it.The ambiance and food was tasty. The service was great. The food presentation was just as you see on a food show. I ordered the lamb & eggs which was delicious. It reminded me more of a dish I would eat in the fall though - it reminded me of a chilli. There were many chunks of lamb and the sauce was quite yummy. I sampled my friends shrimp & grits, which I liked as well. It was adorned with huge gulf shrimp and mushroom garnish. She also ordered a side of sausage - personal favorite! The cava was perfect. The Coffee & Cigarettes was just ok to me. It is an ideal blend of tequila and coffee, but not the taste I was shooting for. The table next to me ordered the pancakes, which look like a big cake (I thought it was a desert). I would definitely try them next time and share because it's massive.Really impressed by the food here. We got the corn with goat milk butter  for appetizer and it was very tasty. For main we got the blue crab pasta and the simple spaghetti. The spaghetti is like the cheapest pasta on the menu but it was absolutely stunning. The pasta is very thick and chewy and the sauce with almond and lemon with a hint of spiciness was just perfect. Also got the sticky date cake for dessert. Now I'm trying to make a date cake myself too... Love this neighborhood jam!So awesome! Went for brunch and the Turkish eggs and donuts with lemon cream were as good as it gets. Cool vibe and good service, though the chef does not do substitutions. Wheelchair accessible entrance and restroom.I have passed by this restaurant at least 100times and during all the COVID madness decided it was time to try it!The outdoor seating was amazing the beautiful long sunflower plants really elevated the space ! Know that the food is all locally sourced from different farms was a great touch The food was really fresh and each dish had a unique delicious taste The cocktails were also wonderful The menu changes seasonally but you really can't go wrong here ! Looking forward to returning here very soonTook a while but finally made it over to Colonie to see for myself what's going on.Meal?Sunday brunchNumber of people in our party?Table for twoOutdoor Seating?Yes - sidewalk and street seating.

This was by far the standout of the meal - it was outstanding and could have easily eaten two servings of this. The Cacio e Pepe got a thumbs up from my friend.The Bloody Mary was eh... and not as described on the menu, aka - it was missing some stuff. Very average and could have used more flavor - aside from ONE piece of lemon, there were no garnishes to be found anywhere; no olive, no celery no flavored rim, etc. Give that cocktail some TLC! After that, I switched to the Last Word, which was a better choice. The Chili Margarita was also tasty and their iced coffee had some strength to it -  it's served in a pint glass.When we sat down, I overheard one of the staff speaking with a customer about this being their first day open for brunch and it's not yet been advertised just yet, however, they have been open for dinner.

We liked it so much, we were inspired to make it at home!- Donuts: we were immediately tempted to get this when we saw it on the menu. The donuts are more on the cakey side, so don't expect airy/fluffy. But flavors are bomb. It also comes with this creamy light lemon sauce that I couldn't stop eating! I'm glad we ended up coming here because I was a littttle skeptical when I first saw the menu and wasn't that impressed. But I was so surprised and can't wait to return!Pesto Bianco...is..back people If you know anything about Brooklyn heights, you know there are several restaurants in a 4 block radius and many of which are your general Thai, Mediterranean, or Sushi restaurants. If you live here, you also know how difficult it is to get your Manhattan friends to make the journey. I'm happy to announce Colonie is golden ticket we've all been waiting for. Firstly, sit at the chefs table. Watching the chefs work their magic is incredible (shout out to Kone (sp) on the pasta. They put so much TLC in their food it really is a treat to watch. All of their drinks are delicious, I especially favor the detox retox, and cuc cocktail. The apps are also fantastic I would recommend 1 per person. Everything is fantastic, esp the sweet potatoes, Brussels (shaved and light not fried) and sunchokes. For dinner- get the spaghettoni. The pesto blanco is almond based and has a spicy after taste. I could eat this for every meal for the rest of my life. It can be made vegan or they can make it into a cheesy delight of that's what you're into. Everything here is A++++, but just expect a $100 for a partyTOP TEN BRUNCH SPOTS IN BK...I've been coming to Colonie for years for breakfast. Their food has always been consistently delicious. Their ambience gets 5 out of 5 stars as well. I always opt to sit at the ""bar"". I love an open concept kitchen. Literally everything is good here. Always come with a big appetite and a few ppl so you can order everything and share. Customer service is always on point. A true gem of Atlantic Avenue, nestled in the back of the main road of the Barclays Center,  walking distance to Brooklyn Bridge Park.It's been a while since I wrote a review but I just wrapped up dinner at Colonie and the experience was so fantastic that I couldn't not write one!Colonie had the trifecta that I'm always looking for --amazing service, food and ambience! From the minute we walked in the host was so warm and welcoming. I was holding flowers and a wet umbrella but needed to run to the restroom and he took both from me while I did that. He was willing to seat me while we waited for the rest of my party (I love when restaurant s don't make you wait for everyone even if you have a reservation). The service continued to be fantastic throughout the meal-- our server was also really nice, gave good recommendations and didn't rush us. The team of servers supporting our table was attentive and quickly took away plates, changed out silverware, etc. and overall worked seamlessly together.Next was the food; we ordered the crudo, burrata, cauliflower, lamb belly, pork chops, and artic char. For desert we had the blueberry sorbet and the sticky date cake. EVERYTHING  was beautifully presented, light and flavorful. Standouts include the burrata which came with charred bread and to my surprise the char went perfectly with the light burrata and it's shaved pickled celery. The lamb belly is a MUST GET, pressed into a square shape like pork belly and crisped on the outside with a mint sauce drizzle it was so flavorful. My husband got it and I was jealous! The cauliflower was also so flavorful-- it came with fresh mint, a mint sauce, pomegranate and fried shallots. The sticky date dessert was amazing -- warm, sweet came paired with ice cream! I wanted a second order of it! My artic char was cooked perfectly. The crudo was light but had a little too much fresh oregano for me. For ambience, the venue is nicely decorated, not overly done, dark wood, plants and clean. Whoever was in charge of music, they get a thumbs up! The music was a great mix of oldies, r&b and a little lover's rock. Great vibe! The team was also diverse from the chefs to the servers and I appreciated that.They are open late too which will make this one of my new go to spots for date night!Been here twice for brunch and blown away each time.  Donuts and monkey bread go well with French press coffee to start. Ricotta is smooth and lemony - goes well with toasted bread!  Shrimp and grits always good. Turkish eggs truly unique and flavorful!  Sunchokes are potatoes make for good sides!  Best of all - we got to sit at one of the corner tables in the front for a sun drenched brunch!I love brunch spots like this. Warm and chill vibe, with amazing food. The scramble was so good, blended with different cheeses and lightly cooked. Potatoes were a bit tangy, with crispy skin and the perfect seasoning. That date cake was literally the best thing I've had the last month. Moist, warm, and a perfect balance of flavor between dates and the melted caramel on it. The ice cream really topped it off. I have nothing but compliments for Colonie and wish I had discovered it earlier. Definitely my new neighborhood favorite. 5 stars from meIt was a little difficult getting a reservation at Colonie. We made a reservation about a week in advance and got a reservation for 9:30pm on a Saturday night. Even with a reservation, we still had to wait 15-20 minutes for our table to be ready. We started out with some drinks. I had the ""Cool Hand Cuke,"" a cucumber and elderflower drink. It was sweet (but not too sweet). I love cucumber in drinks and was not disappointed. For food, the cauliflower dish and snapper crudo caught my eye. Was a little disappointed with the cauliflower dish. There was nothing special about the flavors in the dish and it was too salty for me. However, I LOVED the snapper crudo. The flavor from the coconut milk was so interesting and suited the fish perfectly. It was definitely a novel taste to me and so delicious. Would strongly recommend the snapper crudo. Taste | 4Atmosphere | 4Presentation | 4Service | 4OVERALL | 4Colonie has fabulous food, terrific servers, wonderful ambience and is allergen friendly! I love eating there as it's excellent food and safe for me to eat.We did not have reservations but for a group of 3 we were able to grab a seat along the side bar. Our waiter was very friendly and was very knowledge about the menu. We started with the buttermilk biscuits that came with jam and butter. The jam was sooooooo good. Wow. I thiiiink it was blackberry jam. It was delicious with the biscuits. They were warm and very dense. The outside top part was slightly flakey. Look, just get it. You're welcome. Two of us got the Turkish Eggs and it was such a nice change from what I normally get when I go to brunch. The poached eggs were nice and runny. It sits on top of some Turkish yogurt covered in oil. You can see and taste the chili peppers and garlic and it will linger so maybe have a gum after lol. But it's totally worth it.  It also comes with a side of bread you can dip in there and eat with the eggs. My only issue with the bread was the taste of ash. The Burrata was also delicious and worth trying.I think this is cool spot to visit for brunch.Cute local neighborhood bar with strong drinks and good dessert. The sticky date cake is a must! I'm a very picky eater and not really the one to try new things but this cake was delicious it tasted like chocolate cake but better. Great service and good vibes. Will definitely returnI came here for a brunch during the weekend and overall had an ok experience. They do not take reservations so we were waiting by the door a little before opening time and was able to get the table. Here is the breakdown FoodThe food was ok in my books, very elaborated plates but the flavor factor wasn't there at least for my palette. I ordered the duck confit hash and the house potatoes. My friend ordered the biscuit sandwich-- the biscuit was delicious. Decor/ Ambiance Nice, cutesy rustic modern look. We seat at the chef's table and it was very nice to see them prepare the dishes right in front of you. Nice and lively house music. ServiceThe waiters were friendly. It was busy and they were training their best to be as attentive as they could.Overall Had an ok experience. Great vibe, the food was just not for me. But it might be for you, so still try it.The ambiance and food was tasty. The service was great. The food presentation was just as you see on a food show. I ordered the lamb & eggs which was delicious. It reminded me more of a dish I would eat in the fall though - it reminded me of a chilli. There were many chunks of lamb and the sauce was quite yummy. I sampled my friends shrimp & grits, which I liked as well. It was adorned with huge gulf shrimp and mushroom garnish. She also ordered a side of sausage - personal favorite! The cava was perfect. The Coffee & Cigarettes was just ok to me. It is an ideal blend of tequila and coffee, but not the taste I was shooting for. The table next to me ordered the pancakes, which look like a big cake (I thought it was a desert). I would definitely try them next time and share because it's massive.Really impressed by the food here. We got the corn with goat milk butter  for appetizer and it was very tasty. For main we got the blue crab pasta and the simple spaghetti. The spaghetti is like the cheapest pasta on the menu but it was absolutely stunning. The pasta is very thick and chewy and the sauce with almond and lemon with a hint of spiciness was just perfect. Also got the sticky date cake for dessert. Now I'm trying to make a date cake myself too... Love this neighborhood jam!So awesome! Went for brunch and the Turkish eggs and donuts with lemon cream were as good as it gets. Cool vibe and good service, though the chef does not do substitutions. Wheelchair accessible entrance and restroom.I have passed by this restaurant at least 100times and during all the COVID madness decided it was time to try it!The outdoor seating was amazing the beautiful long sunflower plants really elevated the space ! Know that the food is all locally sourced from different farms was a great touch The food was really fresh and each dish had a unique delicious taste The cocktails were also wonderful The menu changes seasonally but you really can't go wrong here ! Looking forward to returning here very soonTook a while but finally made it over to Colonie to see for myself what's going on.Meal?Sunday brunchNumber of people in our party?Table for twoOutdoor Seating?Yes - sidewalk and street seating. Socially distanced tables with room for approximately 30 people in total. Most tables are fully covered with large, outdoor umbrellas or outdoor tenting. The space is thoughtfully sectioned off from the street with window boxes.What'd we order to eat?*Turkish Eggs *Cacio e Pepe ScrambleWhat'd we order to drink?*Bloody Mary*Last Word*Iced Coffee*Chili Margarita (x2)Things to note?*nice staff*small portions*must wear masks when ordering*small menu*masks and hand sanitizer available*staff adheres to all COVID-related guidelinesThe Turkish Eggs had incredible flavor - the dish itself is beautifully displayed and is accompanied by 4 pieces of toasted bread for dipping. This was by far the standout of the meal - it was outstanding and could have easily eaten two servings of this. The Cacio e Pepe got a thumbs up from my friend.The Bloody Mary was eh... and not as described on the menu, aka - it was missing some stuff. Very average and could have used more flavor - aside from ONE piece of lemon, there were no garnishes to be found anywhere; no olive, no celery no flavored rim, etc. Give that cocktail some TLC! After that, I switched to the Last Word, which was a better choice. The Chili Margarita was also tasty and their iced coffee had some strength to it -  it's served in a pint glass.When we sat down, I overheard one of the staff speaking with a customer about this being their first day open for brunch and it's not yet been advertised just yet, however, they have been open for dinner. The overall experience was good and the vibe was right. Yes, I'd go back but for dinner.I have ordered Turkish egg I must say the food quality was good unfortunately thats the only good thing I can say about the place.Slow service took them over 45 min to serve our food when the place was far of being full.The portion are super small and expensive.Luckily, Colonie has stayed open though the beginning of the Covid craziness. I came by on a Saturday for brunch with a friend.We had the entire bar-like table under the living wall all to ourselves. I ordered a hot coffee (French press) and a blood orange chili margarita. The French press coffee was SO delicious. But - it barely filled my mug and I wish there was a bit more coffee. The margarita was super delicious and I wholeheartedly recommend.My friend and I shared a bunch of plates - the cacio e pepe scramble, the Turkish eggs, the biscuits, and the home fries with aioli. The star of all of this was definitely the Turkish eggs. Everything about this dish is delicious and it's a must order. The cacio e Pepe was a perfect soft scramble and a really delicious dish and for someone wanting perfect simple eggs. The aioli in the home friends had a very intense orange flavor which was just ok for me. The biscuits were stunning, but the flavor was a little too eggy for me. I loved the preserves, and the orange zest really worked.The Turkish eggs are an absolute must with the cacio e Pepe scramble coming in as a close second. I need to get back and try those doughnuts!i was here five years ago and I passed by it recently wanting to try it again. We didn't end up getting a lot of food just an appetizer and some wine because the timing was tough.The server couldn't of been nicer she let us drive all the lines we wanted to before we decided on which one was right. She was helpful and I wish I got her name so I could shower her out here but she has curly hair and was super sweet.The five stars is for the mushroom pate. Make sure you eat it with the Meyer lemon slice (don't take it off). One of the best things I've eaten this year and I've had a lot of tasty items this year. I also loved and would get the Turkish eggs (who knew yogurt would be a winning combo with chili oil and eggs) again and again - if only this place was closer to me and didn't require a wait! Would rinse/repeat these two items till I got sick of them. The pancake is unique - more of a cake to be honest. It was tasty but not what I was looking for. I prefer my pancakes flatter and more dense....coffee is also pretty meh. Get cold brew bc hot coffee - despite being served in a cute French press - was not enjoyable (pretty sour/acidic...too much so for me even with milk added).Brunch review only!We came here on a Sunday around 12:30 and didn't have trouble finding a spot for the 2 of us. We sat at the open kitchen, which was great to see all the dishes being made! Also helped in our decision making since most of the pictures on Yelp were for dinner.We ended up getting the cherry salad, turkish eggs, oysters, and donuts.- Cherry salad: very light and refreshing with prosciutto, manchego and mint! The cherries are a bit tart but still refreshing and sweet! It paired really well the cheese and prosciutto. I thought this was a good combo to the heavier egg dish we shared- Turkish eggs: my first time trying this! It's basically poached eggs, yogurt, and brown butter sauce with fresh dill and spices! SO good! It comes with a side of freshly fired bread. Mix it all up, dip your bread in, and hellooo flavors!

I ordered a few things for pickup and was thoroughly impressed with everything. The arugula salad with French balsamic was simple but absolutely delicious, and the proportions were more than generous. The beet salad with goat cheese was refreshing, and the mushroom croquettes were crispy and flavorful despite my taking a fair amount of time to actually eat them once picked up. I generally add salt to everything, but all of the dishes I received came perfectly seasoned. Can't wait to come back for table service and a cocktail.Very happy to finally visit this place! Their burger is beyond exceptional. My partner got a steak and had food envy after having a bite of it. He said the steak wasn't really that great to begin with. The service here is as good as their burger. I'll come back for sure. Maybe tomorrow. Probably not that soon because I'll still be digesting this burger but it's gonna happenWish there were more cute / low key French bistro like Chez Moi in NYC ! Unpretentious and effortlessly chic -  outdoor seating, tents, string light. Just missing the accordion performers, almost Paris ;)Food was typical bistro fair, e.g. mule frites , steak tartar , fish (mostly NY local), roasted chicken. We ordered exactly what we craved for - mules and frites! Two pounds worth of mussels soaked in buttery shallot rosemary whitewine sauce. Tasted just like what I had at the cute bistro in Montmartre, Pairs. Paired with a crispy un-oaked Macon villages chardonnay, golden. The grilled octopus was nice flavor tho a bit burnt and the sauce a tad too heavy . All in all, this place is a gem!I'm so happy this restaurant was open during COVID-19. After striking out on a couple of other spots we were seated in under 30 minutes on a busy Friday night. We started off with a glass of Sancerre. Excellent wine, nice and crisp. Next up we had the mussels and risotto. Both were delicious. I loved the risotto as it had a little kale in it which I thought was fun and unique!Last but not least we had the chocolate mousse and creme brûlée for dessert. The chocolate mousse was easily the best I've ever had. Licked it clean.Super friendly wait staff and great service. Amazing desserts!We've dined at this French bistro several times this past year.  With its charming and rustic interior, Chez Moi is the kind of place you visit for the ambiance.  While the food and drink are fantastic, unfortunately the table service leaves a lot to be desired.  Since this restaurant is in our neighborhood and we enjoy the food, it's a worthwhile experience.Here are some (hopefully organized) thoughts on our meals:- The seafood is excellent.  I recommend everything from the $1 Oysters to the Tuna Tartare to the Mussels and Wild Skate Fish.  The seafood is fresh, well-prepared, and tasty.- The DIY Charcuterie or Country Pate are a great way to start off your meal... although the bread is so-so TBH.- Skip the Steak, get the Frites!  The Steak isn't terrible, but it tastes like its priced ($27).  Stick to the seafood!- The cocktails are well-made.  The basement speakeasy is a neat way to kick off or wind down your evening.Cheers!This place is fantastic!  The food is good and wait staff are friendly- kid friendly as well! We started off with croquettes which was great then ordered mussels, steak frites and duck breast. The duck breast was the best - crispy skin, juicy fat and tender meat! I got it medium raw. However the dish could do with better sides to compliment the duck! Cherry reduction perhapss?The steak amazingly tender but I havent been to a french bistro that has screwed up steak! The mussels were a hit with the kids!  We ordered desserts and the portions were massive! The profiteroles were the sizes if baby fists ans double ice cream - on top and inside!  The creme brûlée was huge! Overrall  attentive, patient wait staff and amazing food - I am very happy :)Chez Moi is the rare New York French restaurant that serves French food. The experience is excellent, and consistent in a warm, service- forward atmosphere. This also comes at extremely, well-priced value. What I mean by French food, versus other French restaurants,  is that it's not a weak facsimile of touristy, Parisian bistro food. Rather, its food has the flavor, textures, and delicacy of the food of France. I had been to the restaurant years ago, but I came to appreciate it more since my recent trips to French cities outside of Paris with Dijon, Lyon, and Bordeaux coming to mind readily having tasted this food days after returning from Dijon.I'm on the fence about this place between 3 and 4 stars.We shared a brunch at the bar with the chicken sandwich and fries.The fries were some of the cleanest and best I've ever had.  So good in fact, I had almost finished them by the time the ketchup arrived that I asked for 10 minutes ago. I like it when the order comes, already cut and split on separate plates when you tell them you're sharing.   The chicken sandwich was pretty darn good too, but the portion was just ok. (even if whole)I love the ambiance but wife isn't a fan of French wooden bar stools.  I say they cradle my butt nicely.  To each his/her own.It's those drink prices that kick the bill into high gear.  If you're having 2 drinks each, and sharing, you're still looking at $80+ tip.  In the world of sustainability, I don't find that sustainable.  If you're rolling in it...or bypass the booze, I'd recommend it in a minute.   Otherwise, keep strolling Atlantic avenue.A lovely Bistro in the heart of Brooklyn heights with delish food and good Service. We shared several appetizers which were all yummy my favorite was Smoked Salmon with Creme Fraîche, Capers. The smoke salmon as this gal from Brooklyn would call lox was excellent cultivated perfectly with a nice soft oily texture. The oysters where my second favorite starter very creamy just awesome. My main dish Skate fish over purée lima Beans, with veggies. The fish tender flaky and the veggies medley was flavored perfectly. My favorite phrase To describe my feeing I had a fun party in my mouth.  My dessert was incredible, cream Brulé  perfecto yes another grand party in my mouth. I will for sure go back to restaurant bravo my friends. Oui oui.We are visiting from Reno, NV and were told about Chez Moi.  We had a delightful time.  The food was outstanding as well as the service.  I am always astounded at places such as this.  A wonderful gem with a little hidden attitude.  Make sure you find the secret entrance to the amazing craft cocktail bar downstairs.  Very fun to look for and find.  Craft cocktails can be a little stuffy however on this night it was not busy and our cocktail virtuoso delighted us in drink and conversation.Go take a look and enjoy good food and wondrous decor.I live in the area and one of my neighbors recommended this place many times. To be very honest, with so many pizza places I often choose that over French food. Don't be like me!We came here for dinner. First of all, the decor is very beautiful and it felt cozy with the dim lights. We did not have a reservation, but, luckily, someone who did was late or didn't show up. I recommend making a reservation since there are only a few tables (maybe 12?). We were seated promptly and ordered some drinks. The Basilic was a great one - I love when coconut is so nicely incorporated into a drink. I had the Chez Moi, which felt pretty watered down, although the idea was good. We were asked by the waiter to order everything at once so they time everything in the kitchen. For starters: french onion soup, charred octopus and cheese board. The french onion soup was the star: I loved how everything was balanced. The octopus had a somewhat rubbery texture and the hazelnuts/chickpeas did not really make a lot of sense there in our opinion. The cheese board was good, but the cheeses felt like they were just taken out of the fridge. For mains: moules frites (with Provençal sauce), steak tartar and lamb shank. I tried the sauce in the mussels and it was delicious. The steak tartar was very flavorful and fresh as well. Amazing french fries!!The lamb shank was HUGE! It took no effort to take the meat off the bone. The couscous tasted off. The vegetables were simple but cooked correctly. The prices were great considering the amount of food ordered. The main courses come in satisfying portions. I think this place is a good option in the neighborhood.I was in the area mid-week and heard they had $1 oysters so had to stop by.  Had a dozen and they were very good and so ordered another dozen.  I then decided to just have dinner there so ordered mussels  and fries with the marniere - very tasty broth and quite a bit of garlic which I love.  The place definitely has a french bistro look and feel to it with french speaking staff.  A little bit of Paris in Brooklyn. Will be back.Delicious food and incredible service! Vanessa was such a pleasure to have as our server. Though we came at the latest hour, she had so much good energy. The escargot and the French soup were my favorite! The lamb was so soft and fell off the bone right away. Thank you!Love this place! They were able to accommodate me and my husband on a Saturday evening without having a reservation. The food was superb and didn't take long to come out at all. I was ready to have seconds of everything it was all so good. Cant wait to be back!Pretty good French food. We were able to get seated on a Monday night at 8PM without a reservation. We ordered escargot ($13) and pate ($11) to start. For entree, I got the duck breast ($28). The escargot doesn't come with shell but was very tender. Ask for some house bread to soak up the tasty oil and brine. I also really like the duck breast - a texture that almost melts in your mouth. Docked a star for the pate (which was subpar; I wouldn't recommend) and the pricing. It's pretty standard for the area, but entrees are in the mid-$20s and are pretty small.Always a go to for this neighborhood. Fantastic service for one. The food is always top notch. The escargot is fantastic, always a treat, just so, so good. I usually go with the skate, comes with some nice veggies and mashed potatoes. This time I was enticed by the fish special which was some fish, shrimp, mussels, fingerling potato and zucchini in a kind of light curry sauce. All delicious, just beautifully cooked. My buddy always goes for the salmon or chicken, with the salmon being his favorite. Good wine and a really nice chocolate mousse for dessert!What a little gem! Last minute devision resulted in myself my husband and our friend going there for dinner. The ambience is really nice and romantic I would say. Perfect spot for a date. We ordered fois gras, croquettes, minestrone to start with followed by chicken and muscles which were very tasty. Food is nicely presented too! Our waitress was friendly and attentive. We shall be back!Right on the edge of Brooklyn Heights, this french like restaurant really delivers. Very friendly, seats you quickly (with reservations), and works to deliver what you desire.We really enjoyed the oysters, especially during happy hour prices. The escargot is absolutely amazing. The ""steak and frites"" were our hosts favorites, and ordering them once, we agreed. During our three weeks visit, we went here at least four times - and they recognized us quickly.Great place, great food.French food without the pretentiously tiny portion size or brouhaha in presentation and design - what more could I ask for? Chez Moi is immediately inviting and warm on a winter's night, illuminated by dim and intimate lighting, and featuring a small but comfy space for you to enjoy your food. My friend and I got here around 7:30 on a Saturday night so we ended up sitting at the bar, which was perfectly fine because for once, this was a bar with seating that was adequately spaced out so you weren't elbowing the people next to you every five seconds. I ordered the Jolie (absolutely delicious, a little sip of heaven) and the burger, which was excellently prepared and paired with a humongous pile of fries and a well-seasoned salad. The service was a little slow but it was a busy night and the bartender was doing His Best.The food here is really, really excellent and I'm excited to have found another gem in this excellent neighborhood.Great ambiance Great service GREAT DRINKS, you'll like everything. We had the salmon, duck breast, gazpacho, escargot, sorbet, and crème brûlée and we had no complaints.Wow. I ordered a few things for pickup and was thoroughly impressed with everything. The arugula salad with French balsamic was simple but absolutely delicious, and the proportions were more than generous. The beet salad with goat cheese was refreshing, and the mushroom croquettes were crispy and flavorful despite my taking a fair amount of time to actually eat them once picked up. I generally add salt to everything, but all of the dishes I received came perfectly seasoned. Can't wait to come back for table service and a cocktail.Very happy to finally visit this place! Their burger is beyond exceptional. My partner got a steak and had food envy after having a bite of it. He said the steak wasn't really that great to begin with. The service here is as good as their burger. I'll come back for sure. Maybe tomorrow. Probably not that soon because I'll still be digesting this burger but it's gonna happenWish there were more cute / low key French bistro like Chez Moi in NYC ! Unpretentious and effortlessly chic -  outdoor seating, tents, string light. Just missing the accordion performers, almost Paris ;)Food was typical bistro fair, e.g. mule frites , steak tartar , fish (mostly NY local), roasted chicken. We ordered exactly what we craved for - mules and frites! Two pounds worth of mussels soaked in buttery shallot rosemary whitewine sauce. Tasted just like what I had at the cute bistro in Montmartre, Pairs. Paired with a crispy un-oaked Macon villages chardonnay, golden. The grilled octopus was nice flavor tho a bit burnt and the sauce a tad too heavy . All in all, this place is a gem!I'm so happy this restaurant was open during COVID-19. After striking out on a couple of other spots we were seated in under 30 minutes on a busy Friday night. We started off with a glass of Sancerre. Excellent wine, nice and crisp. Next up we had the mussels and risotto. Both were delicious. I loved the risotto as it had a little kale in it which I thought was fun and unique!Last but not least we had the chocolate mousse and creme brûlée for dessert. The chocolate mousse was easily the best I've ever had. Licked it clean.Super friendly wait staff and great service. Amazing desserts!We've dined at this French bistro several times this past year.  With its charming and rustic interior, Chez Moi is the kind of place you visit for the ambiance.  While the food and drink are fantastic, unfortunately the table service leaves a lot to be desired.  Since this restaurant is in our neighborhood and we enjoy the food, it's a worthwhile experience.Here are some (hopefully organized) thoughts on our meals:- The seafood is excellent.  I recommend everything from the $1 Oysters to the Tuna Tartare to the Mussels and Wild Skate Fish.  The seafood is fresh, well-prepared, and tasty.- The DIY Charcuterie or Country Pate are a great way to start off your meal... although the bread is so-so TBH.- Skip the Steak, get the Frites!  The Steak isn't terrible, but it tastes like its priced ($27).  Stick to the seafood!- The cocktails are well-made.  The basement speakeasy is a neat way to kick off or wind down your evening.Cheers!This place is fantastic!  The food is good and wait staff are friendly- kid friendly as well! We started off with croquettes which was great then ordered mussels, steak frites and duck breast. The duck breast was the best - crispy skin, juicy fat and tender meat! I got it medium raw. However the dish could do with better sides to compliment the duck! Cherry reduction perhapss?The steak amazingly tender but I havent been to a french bistro that has screwed up steak! The mussels were a hit with the kids!  We ordered desserts and the portions were massive! The profiteroles were the sizes if baby fists ans double ice cream - on top and inside!  The creme brûlée was huge! Overrall  attentive, patient wait staff and amazing food - I am very happy :)Chez Moi is the rare New York French restaurant that serves French food. The experience is excellent, and consistent in a warm, service- forward atmosphere. This also comes at extremely, well-priced value. What I mean by French food, versus other French restaurants,  is that it's not a weak facsimile of touristy, Parisian bistro food. Rather, its food has the flavor, textures, and delicacy of the food of France. I had been to the restaurant years ago, but I came to appreciate it more since my recent trips to French cities outside of Paris with Dijon, Lyon, and Bordeaux coming to mind readily having tasted this food days after returning from Dijon.I'm on the fence about this place between 3 and 4 stars.We shared a brunch at the bar with the chicken sandwich and fries.The fries were some of the cleanest and best I've ever had.  So good in fact, I had almost finished them by the time the ketchup arrived that I asked for 10 minutes ago. I like it when the order comes, already cut and split on separate plates when you tell them you're sharing.   The chicken sandwich was pretty darn good too, but the portion was just ok. (even if whole)I love the ambiance but wife isn't a fan of French wooden bar stools.  I say they cradle my butt nicely.  To each his/her own.It's those drink prices that kick the bill into high gear.  If you're having 2 drinks each, and sharing, you're still looking at $80+ tip.  In the world of sustainability, I don't find that sustainable.  If you're rolling in it...or bypass the booze, I'd recommend it in a minute.   Otherwise, keep strolling Atlantic avenue.A lovely Bistro in the heart of Brooklyn heights with delish food and good Service. We shared several appetizers which were all yummy my favorite was Smoked Salmon with Creme Fraîche, Capers. The smoke salmon as this gal from Brooklyn would call lox was excellent cultivated perfectly with a nice soft oily texture. The oysters where my second favorite starter very creamy just awesome. My main dish Skate fish over purée lima Beans, with veggies. The fish tender flaky and the veggies medley was flavored perfectly. My favorite phrase To describe my feeing I had a fun party in my mouth.  My dessert was incredible, cream Brulé  perfecto yes another grand party in my mouth. I will for sure go back to restaurant bravo my friends. Oui oui.We are visiting from Reno, NV and were told about Chez Moi.  We had a delightful time.  The food was outstanding as well as the service.  I am always astounded at places such as this.  A wonderful gem with a little hidden attitude.  Make sure you find the secret entrance to the amazing craft cocktail bar downstairs.  Very fun to look for and find.  Craft cocktails can be a little stuffy however on this night it was not busy and our cocktail virtuoso delighted us in drink and conversation.Go take a look and enjoy good food and wondrous decor.I live in the area and one of my neighbors recommended this place many times. To be very honest, with so many pizza places I often choose that over French food. Don't be like me!We came here for dinner. First of all, the decor is very beautiful and it felt cozy with the dim lights. We did not have a reservation, but, luckily, someone who did was late or didn't show up. I recommend making a reservation since there are only a few tables (maybe 12?). We were seated promptly and ordered some drinks. The Basilic was a great one - I love when coconut is so nicely incorporated into a drink. I had the Chez Moi, which felt pretty watered down, although the idea was good. We were asked by the waiter to order everything at once so they time everything in the kitchen. For starters: french onion soup, charred octopus and cheese board. The french onion soup was the star: I loved how everything was balanced. The octopus had a somewhat rubbery texture and the hazelnuts/chickpeas did not really make a lot of sense there in our opinion. The cheese board was good, but the cheeses felt like they were just taken out of the fridge. For mains: moules frites (with Provençal sauce), steak tartar and lamb shank. I tried the sauce in the mussels and it was delicious. The steak tartar was very flavorful and fresh as well. Amazing french fries!!The lamb shank was HUGE!

The smoke salmon as this gal from Brooklyn would call lox was excellent cultivated perfectly with a nice soft oily texture. The oysters where my second favorite starter very creamy just awesome. My main dish Skate fish over purée lima Beans, with veggies. The fish tender flaky and the veggies medley was flavored perfectly. My favorite phrase To describe my feeing I had a fun party in my mouth.  My dessert was incredible, cream Brulé  perfecto yes another grand party in my mouth. I will for sure go back to restaurant bravo my friends. Oui oui.We are visiting from Reno, NV and were told about Chez Moi.  We had a delightful time.  The food was outstanding as well as the service.  I am always astounded at places such as this.  A wonderful gem with a little hidden attitude.  Make sure you find the secret entrance to the amazing craft cocktail bar downstairs.  Very fun to look for and find.  Craft cocktails can be a little stuffy however on this night it was not busy and our cocktail virtuoso delighted us in drink and conversation.Go take a look and enjoy good food and wondrous decor.I live in the area and one of my neighbors recommended this place many times. To be very honest, with so many pizza places I often choose that over French food. Don't be like me!We came here for dinner. First of all, the decor is very beautiful and it felt cozy with the dim lights. We did not have a reservation, but, luckily, someone who did was late or didn't show up. I recommend making a reservation since there are only a few tables (maybe 12?). We were seated promptly and ordered some drinks. The Basilic was a great one - I love when coconut is so nicely incorporated into a drink. I had the Chez Moi, which felt pretty watered down, although the idea was good. We were asked by the waiter to order everything at once so they time everything in the kitchen. For starters: french onion soup, charred octopus and cheese board. The french onion soup was the star: I loved how everything was balanced. The octopus had a somewhat rubbery texture and the hazelnuts/chickpeas did not really make a lot of sense there in our opinion. The cheese board was good, but the cheeses felt like they were just taken out of the fridge. For mains: moules frites (with Provençal sauce), steak tartar and lamb shank. I tried the sauce in the mussels and it was delicious. The steak tartar was very flavorful and fresh as well. Amazing french fries!!The lamb shank was HUGE! It took no effort to take the meat off the bone. The couscous tasted off. The vegetables were simple but cooked correctly. The prices were great considering the amount of food ordered. The main courses come in satisfying portions. I think this place is a good option in the neighborhood.I was in the area mid-week and heard they had $1 oysters so had to stop by.  Had a dozen and they were very good and so ordered another dozen.  I then decided to just have dinner there so ordered mussels  and fries with the marniere - very tasty broth and quite a bit of garlic which I love.  The place definitely has a french bistro look and feel to it with french speaking staff.  A little bit of Paris in Brooklyn. Will be back.Delicious food and incredible service! Vanessa was such a pleasure to have as our server. Though we came at the latest hour, she had so much good energy. The escargot and the French soup were my favorite! The lamb was so soft and fell off the bone right away. Thank you!Love this place! They were able to accommodate me and my husband on a Saturday evening without having a reservation. The food was superb and didn't take long to come out at all. I was ready to have seconds of everything it was all so good. Cant wait to be back!Pretty good French food. We were able to get seated on a Monday night at 8PM without a reservation. We ordered escargot ($13) and pate ($11) to start. For entree, I got the duck breast ($28). The escargot doesn't come with shell but was very tender. Ask for some house bread to soak up the tasty oil and brine. I also really like the duck breast - a texture that almost melts in your mouth. Docked a star for the pate (which was subpar; I wouldn't recommend) and the pricing. It's pretty standard for the area, but entrees are in the mid-$20s and are pretty small.Always a go to for this neighborhood. Fantastic service for one. The food is always top notch. The escargot is fantastic, always a treat, just so, so good. I usually go with the skate, comes with some nice veggies and mashed potatoes. This time I was enticed by the fish special which was some fish, shrimp, mussels, fingerling potato and zucchini in a kind of light curry sauce. All delicious, just beautifully cooked. My buddy always goes for the salmon or chicken, with the salmon being his favorite. Good wine and a really nice chocolate mousse for dessert!What a little gem! Last minute devision resulted in myself my husband and our friend going there for dinner. The ambience is really nice and romantic I would say. Perfect spot for a date. We ordered fois gras, croquettes, minestrone to start with followed by chicken and muscles which were very tasty. Food is nicely presented too! Our waitress was friendly and attentive. We shall be back!Right on the edge of Brooklyn Heights, this french like restaurant really delivers. Very friendly, seats you quickly (with reservations), and works to deliver what you desire.We really enjoyed the oysters, especially during happy hour prices. The escargot is absolutely amazing. The ""steak and frites"" were our hosts favorites, and ordering them once, we agreed. During our three weeks visit, we went here at least four times - and they recognized us quickly.Great place, great food.French food without the pretentiously tiny portion size or brouhaha in presentation and design - what more could I ask for? Chez Moi is immediately inviting and warm on a winter's night, illuminated by dim and intimate lighting, and featuring a small but comfy space for you to enjoy your food. My friend and I got here around 7:30 on a Saturday night so we ended up sitting at the bar, which was perfectly fine because for once, this was a bar with seating that was adequately spaced out so you weren't elbowing the people next to you every five seconds. I ordered the Jolie (absolutely delicious, a little sip of heaven) and the burger, which was excellently prepared and paired with a humongous pile of fries and a well-seasoned salad. The service was a little slow but it was a busy night and the bartender was doing His Best.The food here is really, really excellent and I'm excited to have found another gem in this excellent neighborhood.Great ambiance Great service GREAT DRINKS, you'll like everything. We had the salmon, duck breast, gazpacho, escargot, sorbet, and crème brûlée and we had no complaints.Wow. I ordered a few things for pickup and was thoroughly impressed with everything. The arugula salad with French balsamic was simple but absolutely delicious, and the proportions were more than generous. The beet salad with goat cheese was refreshing, and the mushroom croquettes were crispy and flavorful despite my taking a fair amount of time to actually eat them once picked up. I generally add salt to everything, but all of the dishes I received came perfectly seasoned. Can't wait to come back for table service and a cocktail.Very happy to finally visit this place! Their burger is beyond exceptional. My partner got a steak and had food envy after having a bite of it. He said the steak wasn't really that great to begin with. The service here is as good as their burger. I'll come back for sure. Maybe tomorrow. Probably not that soon because I'll still be digesting this burger but it's gonna happenWish there were more cute / low key French bistro like Chez Moi in NYC ! Unpretentious and effortlessly chic -  outdoor seating, tents, string light. Just missing the accordion performers, almost Paris ;)Food was typical bistro fair, e.g. mule frites , steak tartar , fish (mostly NY local), roasted chicken. We ordered exactly what we craved for - mules and frites! Two pounds worth of mussels soaked in buttery shallot rosemary whitewine sauce. Tasted just like what I had at the cute bistro in Montmartre, Pairs. Paired with a crispy un-oaked Macon villages chardonnay, golden. The grilled octopus was nice flavor tho a bit burnt and the sauce a tad too heavy . All in all, this place is a gem!I'm so happy this restaurant was open during COVID-19. After striking out on a couple of other spots we were seated in under 30 minutes on a busy Friday night. We started off with a glass of Sancerre. Excellent wine, nice and crisp. Next up we had the mussels and risotto. Both were delicious. I loved the risotto as it had a little kale in it which I thought was fun and unique!Last but not least we had the chocolate mousse and creme brûlée for dessert. The chocolate mousse was easily the best I've ever had. Licked it clean.Super friendly wait staff and great service. Amazing desserts!We've dined at this French bistro several times this past year.  With its charming and rustic interior, Chez Moi is the kind of place you visit for the ambiance.  While the food and drink are fantastic, unfortunately the table service leaves a lot to be desired.  Since this restaurant is in our neighborhood and we enjoy the food, it's a worthwhile experience.Here are some (hopefully organized) thoughts on our meals:- The seafood is excellent.  I recommend everything from the $1 Oysters to the Tuna Tartare to the Mussels and Wild Skate Fish.  The seafood is fresh, well-prepared, and tasty.- The DIY Charcuterie or Country Pate are a great way to start off your meal... although the bread is so-so TBH.- Skip the Steak, get the Frites!  The Steak isn't terrible, but it tastes like its priced ($27).  Stick to the seafood!- The cocktails are well-made.  The basement speakeasy is a neat way to kick off or wind down your evening.Cheers!This place is fantastic!  The food is good and wait staff are friendly- kid friendly as well! We started off with croquettes which was great then ordered mussels, steak frites and duck breast. The duck breast was the best - crispy skin, juicy fat and tender meat! I got it medium raw. However the dish could do with better sides to compliment the duck! Cherry reduction perhapss?The steak amazingly tender but I havent been to a french bistro that has screwed up steak! The mussels were a hit with the kids!  We ordered desserts and the portions were massive! The profiteroles were the sizes if baby fists ans double ice cream - on top and inside!  The creme brûlée was huge! Overrall  attentive, patient wait staff and amazing food - I am very happy :)Chez Moi is the rare New York French restaurant that serves French food. The experience is excellent, and consistent in a warm, service- forward atmosphere. This also comes at extremely, well-priced value. What I mean by French food, versus other French restaurants,  is that it's not a weak facsimile of touristy, Parisian bistro food. Rather, its food has the flavor, textures, and delicacy of the food of France. I had been to the restaurant years ago, but I came to appreciate it more since my recent trips to French cities outside of Paris with Dijon, Lyon, and Bordeaux coming to mind readily having tasted this food days after returning from Dijon.I'm on the fence about this place between 3 and 4 stars.We shared a brunch at the bar with the chicken sandwich and fries.The fries were some of the cleanest and best I've ever had.  So good in fact, I had almost finished them by the time the ketchup arrived that I asked for 10 minutes ago. I like it when the order comes, already cut and split on separate plates when you tell them you're sharing.   The chicken sandwich was pretty darn good too, but the portion was just ok. (even if whole)I love the ambiance but wife isn't a fan of French wooden bar stools.  I say they cradle my butt nicely.  To each his/her own.It's those drink prices that kick the bill into high gear.  If you're having 2 drinks each, and sharing, you're still looking at $80+ tip.  In the world of sustainability, I don't find that sustainable.  If you're rolling in it...or bypass the booze, I'd recommend it in a minute.   Otherwise, keep strolling Atlantic avenue.A lovely Bistro in the heart of Brooklyn heights with delish food and good Service.

They are all about the customer- making you glad you chose to have a meal there. Service is tops as is the carefully crafted cuisine. While the food, service and atmosphere will be presenting you with finer dining, it is more relaxed and unfussy. There is a reason they have been around long enough to see other revered places come and go- they know what they do and they they do it well. This is the kind of place that you can easily enjoy a date or impress out of town guests that probably have pre-conceived notions of what Brooklyn dining is like. Once thing is for sure- not only will you leave satisfied, you'll probably already be planning your next visit.The outdoor dining was nice and cute with the lighting in a pretty quiet neighborhood. We had the octopus and crab cake as our starters. The octopus was tasty and el Dante inside. This was my first time ever having elk chop! I was blown away! The seasoning was great and the elk was cooked perfectly. The elk also wasn't too gamy paired perfectly with Turley Juvenile Zinfandel. What a little charm in the neighborhood!!Very welcomed restaurant in a historic Brooklyn Heights. Very well spaced distance between tables, attentive server and bus boys - followed all the distance rules. Food is amazing. Unique elk chops, soft shell crabs - this is what you have to come for! Salad was great too. Perfect portion size. Definitely must try.Nice setting and outdoor dining. Pretty good cocktails, and the octopus was well cooked. However, the entrees were lackluster. The salmon with mustard three ways was very exciting on the menu, but on the plate was just fish with some mustard sauce and garnish. The duck with mushrooms was disappointing - the mushrooms were basically stewed in a sweet brown gravy that I would expect to see in a cafeteria more than a restaurant.Came here for brunch. I ordered Tortilla Espanola and it comes with a side salad. I asked if i could sub it for anything else and they said no? They said I can only remove it and then I would have to order a side of somthing else? When my Tortilla came, it was tiny, maybe half a portion and it was dry. The salad that I didn't want was wilted. When the check came, I saw they charged me $4 for my gingerale???During these tough time this place delivers! They are doing ""Take Away"" and it is great!Wow.This place is an institution, and definitely one of the best places you can go to in the neighborhood for a real sit down meal.    They moved down the street from their old location but the food is the same and the atmosphere is better than before. In the fall their wild game menu is wild!  Year round the menu is filled with hits.  When my girlfriend goes a week without giving me a hard time this is where I bring her for date night, and they never disappoint us.Sit down have some wine and choose anything on the menu, you can't go wrong.The mustard chops weren't welcomed, thank you--I ordered the elk chops; they had an excessive, overpowering amount of mustard. I enjoy and can handle well spicy foods, but this was an overkill. I was tearing up, and couldn't taste the meat allegedly exquisite meat underneath the mustard. Shame on the chef!The black sea bass and the consommé were alright, to be fair.Nice Pinot Noir, ok.Overall:Bah.This place is awesome. I highly recommend! Great service, fresh ingredient, and food is just amazing. Bread, soup, salad, crab cake, salmon, steak, and tiramisu ImpeccableAmazing restaurant in Brooklyn Heights! will definitely be backWe have been coming here about annually for the past 10 years. It's a long trek from CT, but it's worth it. We love wild game and this place knows how to bring out the best in it. Walnut crusted chicken was so surprisingly delicious. The elk chop superb. The duck (both sour cherry sauce and ginger soy) were more than expected. The deserts are not a strong point here. Mediocre. Particularly in contrast to the strong medley of flavors in the main courses. Still, we will be back!KenScale: 8.0/10My wife Jun and I go on a double date from time to time with my former co-worker and her husband (an avid foodie) to check out new restaurants. Ever since the couple had a baby, it has become a bit more challenging to find a place that could work for the next restaurant trips. The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights so I asked them if there is any restaurant in their neighborhood that is convenient for them to meet up for dinner before the summer's end. The foodie husband said Henry's End which I had never heard of until that point was his all-time Brooklyn Heights favorite. I was certainly intrigued and took on their offer to come visit Brooklyn Heights to visit the restaurant. When Jun and I walked in, I had an impression at the moment that I was inside a dive bar with exposed bricks and a very quaint décor. Not that the venue's vibe really matters for me; Jun and I dislike places with fancy settings but food that turns out to be underwhelming more than places with humbling settings but have very delicious food. And surprisingly the food at Henry's End turned out to be quite good.The menu at Henry's End is a loose group of New American dishes with locally sourced ingredients and influences from different parts of the country. The dishes here tend to be on a more rustic side. Jun wished the sauce were slightly less sweet, but still very much enjoyed the barbecue ribs whose texture was more or less perfect. The shrimp sautéed with spicy Andouille sausage was also very nice for an appetizer, with a Southern style that was hearty and satisfying. Jun, always a duck meat aficionado, ordered the duckling honey-ginger that the foodie husband highly recommended. I stole some bites from the duckling and it was cooked quite aptly to give the texture that the duck meat must have to shine at a dinner table. On the other hand, the main dish that I had ordered, veal scallopine sautéed with roasted garlic, lemon, capers and basil, was a little bit too aggressive in the seasoning department even though the meat itself was gently prepared. Don't skip desserts at Henry's End! You have two different versions of mud pie, and the Mrs. Mud Pie version that Jun chose was absolutely decadent with vanilla and Heath Bar Crunch ice creams on a Graham Cracker crust, topped with hot butterscotch sauce. Same goes for the delightful Persian lime pie, consisting of fresh lime pastry cream on a Graham Cracker crust. While neither dish looked too healthy, we didn't mind feeling a little bit guilty and promised each other that we will put extra efforts into our gym classes for the rest of the week.I have no idea how difficult it is to snag a reservation at Henry's End but the restaurant was mostly packed with local Brooklynites during our Wednesday meal so booking in advance seems like a good idea. As noted above, the décor and atmosphere of the restaurant might scare you off a little but I suggest that you get comfortable with embracing the old-school vibe of this place. The wine list at Henry's End was quite a surprise; I didn't expect to see so many bottles, many of them from California, from older vintages all the way to the 20th century at bargain prices. There are also daily wines by the glass available that you should take advantage of. Henry's End is one of those restaurants that if you live in the neighborhood you would want to come back again and again for a reliable dining experience. Jun and I certainly would love to come back again to try other dishes and explore the wine list.A true gem of Brooklyn Heights! A very unique menu featuring many fresh ""game"" meats (I.e rabbit, deer, duck, etc) which maintains unbelievable quality and is well worth the price. Food: I had ordered the a mixed plates with duck, rabbit, and venison and everything was impeccable. My friend described his chicken as best chicken if his life. Drinks: short but fantastic beer menu featuring local gems. I ordered wine special which was excellent and fairly priced.Service: really amazing service. Wait staff was very attentive and genuinely cares we were satisfied. Vibes: My favorite part of Henry's End is it is not pretentious. To have this level of food and service it is refreshing to have a relaxed unassuming atmosphere.Went here because they have ""game meat"" which sounded really interesting. Well, I finally had kangaroo - it was diced meat in a pasta wrap. Not really that interesting. Tasted like chicken.So that was sort of disappointing. Still, the food, ambience, and conversation was wonderful... we did have duck, and a few other interesting meats that were truly tasty.As non NYC folks in Brooklyn, we engaged with a man who did reviews of many many NYC area restaurants - he did a blog, and was into the many hundreds of restaurants.... he said this was one of his favorites.Overall, we had a great meal (twice) and had a great time. Good food, good wine, ate kangaroo... what more could you want? ;)This is a bold statement... but Henry's End may have one of the best menus in all of New York City.  Just go.  The end.My wife and I and friends have been coming to this restaurant for years.We are disappointed that the dishes now do not include rice and a few vegetables.  The cost is probably around 50 cents.  Dishes like mash potatoes which tasted like instant mashed potatoes do not go with Sole with Lobster.  Then there is the glare from the sun shining from the building right across from the restaurant. It's not like there is a fantastic view, there is no view.   Anyway the glare makes enjoying the experience very unpleasant to say the least.  Everyone would want to sit across from their loved one, not side by side.Then there is the wine.  Chardonnays that are eleven years old are usually not good as was the case with this wine.  They used to have very good wine at fairly high prices, now the wine is more expensive and is not a good quality.Then there is the atmosphere which is not the same as the previous location which was dark and romantic instead the new place is very bright and sterile.  Bring back the candles like they had before.And the wait staff has much to be desired.  They are not very friendly as in they take your order and someone else brings you your order.  The waiter did not even thank us for the tip!Non the less, the owner tries his best to be accommodating.  He does need to be open to installing some nice shades to cut down on the glare, improve his wine selection and include rice and vegetables with dishes as he did before.  Also I would suggest that he warmly greet his guests to make them feel special. Why do things have to change for the worst!Amazing food. Very traditional dishes and cozy ambiance. Anything you ask for is delicious. Wine list has plenty of great wines. Love the truffled French fries.Our friends from Brooklyn brought us here for dinner last night. My husband and I were blown away! I wasn't even hungry but the food was so amazing I cleaned my plate! The four of us all ordered completely different dishes and everything was so good! I had the Scottish Salmon which was cooked to perfection and melted in my mouth. My husband had the Steak Au Poivre which was also cooked to perfection and had such delicious flavor. The food is very fresh and the service is great. This will be a regular for us when we travel into Brooklyn!An old stand by on Henry Street in Brooklyn Heights consistently serving great food for many years. They also serve Game Meat every fall. You can't go wrong with what you order. The steaks are particularly very good.Welcomed very quickly and sat immediately. Felt the servers were a little inattentive once our order was placed. Food was amazing! A bit loud for good conversation but overall a great experienceABOMINABLE !I went to the old Henry's End through the 90s and early 2000s.I thought it would be exceptional enough for a friend's birthday dinner who I wanted to have good food and a good experience. That did not happen, and to a shocking extent. The food was revolting slop that looked like what you would find served in a prison, and (literally) toxic to an extent you would not EVEN find in a prison. I have never written (or felt compelled to write) anything like this--and the following--ever before.I made reservations a week before, discussed that it was a friend's birthday, and requested a good table as I was booking in advance. This meant nothing when arrived as we were sat in their new not very exceptional dining room, at one of the even less exceptional (or desirable) tables, just as if we walked in off the street. When I asked if a better table could be provided (there were a few better empty tables in the room) I was told no, and that people reserved the other tables THAT day. However, after a while we WE'RE given a less bad table and told ""people canceled"" as if a favor was being done for us.We started with drinks. I was given a martini on the rocks that was watered down from the ""couple"" if ice cubes in it. My friend's daiquiri was unrecognizable from any daiquiri EVER and tasted like nothing I have ever tasted even in the worst dive bar. She sent the drink back, and it was not the first thing that got rejected from our table during the evening. (I should have rejected everything.)I had started dinner with the Caesar salad, she, the Duck Mousse. The salad was 'OK' but the mousse was more a puree than mousse and came with the unwanted surprise of chutney mixed in the under portion of it. This was NOT listed in the menu description. We also both switched to wine knowing no ""mixing skill"" would be required. THIS is the least awful part of ""dinner.""The entrees came. We both ordered ""Braised Duck with Seasonal Wild Mushrooms, Shallots, Thyme, and Lingonberries."" My dinner companion ordered mashed potatoes, and I ordered sautéed spinach. The plates with the duck were non-descript brown heaps of sauce with something underneath. The spinach was swimming in water and the mashed potatoes were slopped onto the plate in lumpy mound. We each tasted our side dishes. Mine was at least not overcooked (I would suffer form having eaten it later.) Hers caused an expression on her face that caused me immediately to taste it. And I was APPALLED.It was a tasteless mountain of paste except for the overwhelming amount of SALT that had been DUMPED into it. She then tasted her duck, looked horrified, and said ""I cannot eat this."" I tasted it as well and it was horrendously tough, over cooked, and comprised (again) mostly of salt. This was to an extent I have never encountered before. If there were mushrooms, rice or shallots (described in the menu description) anywhere on the plate, I could not tell. Everything was mixed into an ugly overbearing brown sauce that was slathered over the inedible --equally ugly--brown carcass on her plate. BOTH of her dishes got sent back. Unfortunately, my friend's appetite was destroyed at this point and she said she could not eat anything else.MY duck was not so badly overcooked, but equally buried underan ugly, heavy brown sauce. Perhaps out of shook over encountering one horrible thing after another, I ate my duck along with my spinach. It was not good and I would pay for that--in a couple of ways. My paying with my health, continued the day after eating at Henry's End, by feeling extremely unwell and like I mainlined SALT.I convinced my friend to order dessert. She acquiesced. ANOTHER big mistake. Her ""Black and White Mousse"" was a thin layer of chocolate mousse under a thick layer of frozen cream. My Chocolate Hazelnut Cake was nothing you can't get in a diner, except for the ""extra"" taste of salt. This added to the toxic levels that at that point, had already been delivered into my system.I foolishly ordered coffee. The coffee had a ""burnt"" odor, and when I poured the cream into it, a curdle ""chunk"" plopped into the cup, sending little curdled particles of cream out in a ripple effect throughout the surface of the beverage.Today as last night, I pay with my health by still feeling ill from the mega does of salt I can still taste and was DUMPED in COPIUS amounts into almost everything served. I usually have no problem with salt. But today, the thought of it makes me feel ill. As I and my dinner companion both believe the duck was prepared MANY hours before it was served, it may have been left out to accumulate bacteria. That would account for how bad I felt the following day.I saved up for last night. If anyone thinks as I did--of their good memories of the old ""Henry's End"" with a mind towards going, there PLEASE reconsider.Shame on you Henry's End... for the last time I was there !Consistently a shining star of a Brooklyn dining experience. They are all about the customer- making you glad you chose to have a meal there. Service is tops as is the carefully crafted cuisine. While the food, service and atmosphere will be presenting you with finer dining, it is more relaxed and unfussy. There is a reason they have been around long enough to see other revered places come and go- they know what they do and they they do it well. This is the kind of place that you can easily enjoy a date or impress out of town guests that probably have pre-conceived notions of what Brooklyn dining is like. Once thing is for sure- not only will you leave satisfied, you'll probably already be planning your next visit.The outdoor dining was nice and cute with the lighting in a pretty quiet neighborhood. We had the octopus and crab cake as our starters. The octopus was tasty and el Dante inside. This was my first time ever having elk chop! I was blown away! The seasoning was great and the elk was cooked perfectly. The elk also wasn't too gamy paired perfectly with Turley Juvenile Zinfandel. What a little charm in the neighborhood!!Very welcomed restaurant in a historic Brooklyn Heights. Very well spaced distance between tables, attentive server and bus boys - followed all the distance rules. Food is amazing. Unique elk chops, soft shell crabs - this is what you have to come for! Salad was great too. Perfect portion size. Definitely must try.Nice setting and outdoor dining. Pretty good cocktails, and the octopus was well cooked. However, the entrees were lackluster. The salmon with mustard three ways was very exciting on the menu, but on the plate was just fish with some mustard sauce and garnish. The duck with mushrooms was disappointing - the mushrooms were basically stewed in a sweet brown gravy that I would expect to see in a cafeteria more than a restaurant.Came here for brunch. I ordered Tortilla Espanola and it comes with a side salad. I asked if i could sub it for anything else and they said no?

The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights so I asked them if there is any restaurant in their neighborhood that is convenient for them to meet up for dinner before the summer's end. The foodie husband said Henry's End which I had never heard of until that point was his all-time Brooklyn Heights favorite. I was certainly intrigued and took on their offer to come visit Brooklyn Heights to visit the restaurant. When Jun and I walked in, I had an impression at the moment that I was inside a dive bar with exposed bricks and a very quaint décor. Not that the venue's vibe really matters for me; Jun and I dislike places with fancy settings but food that turns out to be underwhelming more than places with humbling settings but have very delicious food. And surprisingly the food at Henry's End turned out to be quite good.The menu at Henry's End is a loose group of New American dishes with locally sourced ingredients and influences from different parts of the country. The dishes here tend to be on a more rustic side. Jun wished the sauce were slightly less sweet, but still very much enjoyed the barbecue ribs whose texture was more or less perfect. The shrimp sautéed with spicy Andouille sausage was also very nice for an appetizer, with a Southern style that was hearty and satisfying. Jun, always a duck meat aficionado, ordered the duckling honey-ginger that the foodie husband highly recommended. I stole some bites from the duckling and it was cooked quite aptly to give the texture that the duck meat must have to shine at a dinner table. On the other hand, the main dish that I had ordered, veal scallopine sautéed with roasted garlic, lemon, capers and basil, was a little bit too aggressive in the seasoning department even though the meat itself was gently prepared. Don't skip desserts at Henry's End! You have two different versions of mud pie, and the Mrs. Mud Pie version that Jun chose was absolutely decadent with vanilla and Heath Bar Crunch ice creams on a Graham Cracker crust, topped with hot butterscotch sauce. Same goes for the delightful Persian lime pie, consisting of fresh lime pastry cream on a Graham Cracker crust. While neither dish looked too healthy, we didn't mind feeling a little bit guilty and promised each other that we will put extra efforts into our gym classes for the rest of the week.I have no idea how difficult it is to snag a reservation at Henry's End but the restaurant was mostly packed with local Brooklynites during our Wednesday meal so booking in advance seems like a good idea. As noted above, the décor and atmosphere of the restaurant might scare you off a little but I suggest that you get comfortable with embracing the old-school vibe of this place. The wine list at Henry's End was quite a surprise; I didn't expect to see so many bottles, many of them from California, from older vintages all the way to the 20th century at bargain prices. There are also daily wines by the glass available that you should take advantage of. Henry's End is one of those restaurants that if you live in the neighborhood you would want to come back again and again for a reliable dining experience. Jun and I certainly would love to come back again to try other dishes and explore the wine list.A true gem of Brooklyn Heights! A very unique menu featuring many fresh ""game"" meats (I.e rabbit, deer, duck, etc) which maintains unbelievable quality and is well worth the price. Food: I had ordered the a mixed plates with duck, rabbit, and venison and everything was impeccable. My friend described his chicken as best chicken if his life. Drinks: short but fantastic beer menu featuring local gems. I ordered wine special which was excellent and fairly priced.Service: really amazing service. Wait staff was very attentive and genuinely cares we were satisfied. Vibes: My favorite part of Henry's End is it is not pretentious. To have this level of food and service it is refreshing to have a relaxed unassuming atmosphere.Went here because they have ""game meat"" which sounded really interesting. Well, I finally had kangaroo - it was diced meat in a pasta wrap. Not really that interesting. Tasted like chicken.So that was sort of disappointing. Still, the food, ambience, and conversation was wonderful... we did have duck, and a few other interesting meats that were truly tasty.As non NYC folks in Brooklyn, we engaged with a man who did reviews of many many NYC area restaurants - he did a blog, and was into the many hundreds of restaurants.... he said this was one of his favorites.Overall, we had a great meal (twice) and had a great time. Good food, good wine, ate kangaroo... what more could you want? ;)This is a bold statement... but Henry's End may have one of the best menus in all of New York City.  Just go.  The end.My wife and I and friends have been coming to this restaurant for years.We are disappointed that the dishes now do not include rice and a few vegetables.  The cost is probably around 50 cents.  Dishes like mash potatoes which tasted like instant mashed potatoes do not go with Sole with Lobster.  Then there is the glare from the sun shining from the building right across from the restaurant. It's not like there is a fantastic view, there is no view.   Anyway the glare makes enjoying the experience very unpleasant to say the least.  Everyone would want to sit across from their loved one, not side by side.Then there is the wine.  Chardonnays that are eleven years old are usually not good as was the case with this wine.  They used to have very good wine at fairly high prices, now the wine is more expensive and is not a good quality.Then there is the atmosphere which is not the same as the previous location which was dark and romantic instead the new place is very bright and sterile.  Bring back the candles like they had before.And the wait staff has much to be desired.  They are not very friendly as in they take your order and someone else brings you your order.  The waiter did not even thank us for the tip!Non the less, the owner tries his best to be accommodating.  He does need to be open to installing some nice shades to cut down on the glare, improve his wine selection and include rice and vegetables with dishes as he did before.  Also I would suggest that he warmly greet his guests to make them feel special. Why do things have to change for the worst!Amazing food. Very traditional dishes and cozy ambiance. Anything you ask for is delicious. Wine list has plenty of great wines. Love the truffled French fries.Our friends from Brooklyn brought us here for dinner last night. My husband and I were blown away! I wasn't even hungry but the food was so amazing I cleaned my plate! The four of us all ordered completely different dishes and everything was so good! I had the Scottish Salmon which was cooked to perfection and melted in my mouth. My husband had the Steak Au Poivre which was also cooked to perfection and had such delicious flavor. The food is very fresh and the service is great. This will be a regular for us when we travel into Brooklyn!An old stand by on Henry Street in Brooklyn Heights consistently serving great food for many years. They also serve Game Meat every fall. You can't go wrong with what you order. The steaks are particularly very good.Welcomed very quickly and sat immediately. Felt the servers were a little inattentive once our order was placed. Food was amazing! A bit loud for good conversation but overall a great experienceABOMINABLE !I went to the old Henry's End through the 90s and early 2000s.I thought it would be exceptional enough for a friend's birthday dinner who I wanted to have good food and a good experience. That did not happen, and to a shocking extent. The food was revolting slop that looked like what you would find served in a prison, and (literally) toxic to an extent you would not EVEN find in a prison. I have never written (or felt compelled to write) anything like this--and the following--ever before.I made reservations a week before, discussed that it was a friend's birthday, and requested a good table as I was booking in advance. This meant nothing when arrived as we were sat in their new not very exceptional dining room, at one of the even less exceptional (or desirable) tables, just as if we walked in off the street. When I asked if a better table could be provided (there were a few better empty tables in the room) I was told no, and that people reserved the other tables THAT day. However, after a while we WE'RE given a less bad table and told ""people canceled"" as if a favor was being done for us.We started with drinks. I was given a martini on the rocks that was watered down from the ""couple"" if ice cubes in it. My friend's daiquiri was unrecognizable from any daiquiri EVER and tasted like nothing I have ever tasted even in the worst dive bar. She sent the drink back, and it was not the first thing that got rejected from our table during the evening. (I should have rejected everything.)I had started dinner with the Caesar salad, she, the Duck Mousse. The salad was 'OK' but the mousse was more a puree than mousse and came with the unwanted surprise of chutney mixed in the under portion of it. This was NOT listed in the menu description. We also both switched to wine knowing no ""mixing skill"" would be required. THIS is the least awful part of ""dinner.""The entrees came. We both ordered ""Braised Duck with Seasonal Wild Mushrooms, Shallots, Thyme, and Lingonberries."" My dinner companion ordered mashed potatoes, and I ordered sautéed spinach. The plates with the duck were non-descript brown heaps of sauce with something underneath. The spinach was swimming in water and the mashed potatoes were slopped onto the plate in lumpy mound. We each tasted our side dishes. Mine was at least not overcooked (I would suffer form having eaten it later.) Hers caused an expression on her face that caused me immediately to taste it. And I was APPALLED.It was a tasteless mountain of paste except for the overwhelming amount of SALT that had been DUMPED into it. She then tasted her duck, looked horrified, and said ""I cannot eat this."" I tasted it as well and it was horrendously tough, over cooked, and comprised (again) mostly of salt. This was to an extent I have never encountered before. If there were mushrooms, rice or shallots (described in the menu description) anywhere on the plate, I could not tell. Everything was mixed into an ugly overbearing brown sauce that was slathered over the inedible --equally ugly--brown carcass on her plate. BOTH of her dishes got sent back. Unfortunately, my friend's appetite was destroyed at this point and she said she could not eat anything else.MY duck was not so badly overcooked, but equally buried underan ugly, heavy brown sauce. Perhaps out of shook over encountering one horrible thing after another, I ate my duck along with my spinach. It was not good and I would pay for that--in a couple of ways. My paying with my health, continued the day after eating at Henry's End, by feeling extremely unwell and like I mainlined SALT.I convinced my friend to order dessert. She acquiesced. ANOTHER big mistake. Her ""Black and White Mousse"" was a thin layer of chocolate mousse under a thick layer of frozen cream. My Chocolate Hazelnut Cake was nothing you can't get in a diner, except for the ""extra"" taste of salt. This added to the toxic levels that at that point, had already been delivered into my system.I foolishly ordered coffee. The coffee had a ""burnt"" odor, and when I poured the cream into it, a curdle ""chunk"" plopped into the cup, sending little curdled particles of cream out in a ripple effect throughout the surface of the beverage.Today as last night, I pay with my health by still feeling ill from the mega does of salt I can still taste and was DUMPED in COPIUS amounts into almost everything served. I usually have no problem with salt. But today, the thought of it makes me feel ill. As I and my dinner companion both believe the duck was prepared MANY hours before it was served, it may have been left out to accumulate bacteria. That would account for how bad I felt the following day.I saved up for last night. If anyone thinks as I did--of their good memories of the old ""Henry's End"" with a mind towards going, there PLEASE reconsider.Shame on you Henry's End... for the last time I was there !Consistently a shining star of a Brooklyn dining experience. They are all about the customer- making you glad you chose to have a meal there. Service is tops as is the carefully crafted cuisine. While the food, service and atmosphere will be presenting you with finer dining, it is more relaxed and unfussy. There is a reason they have been around long enough to see other revered places come and go- they know what they do and they they do it well. This is the kind of place that you can easily enjoy a date or impress out of town guests that probably have pre-conceived notions of what Brooklyn dining is like. Once thing is for sure- not only will you leave satisfied, you'll probably already be planning your next visit.The outdoor dining was nice and cute with the lighting in a pretty quiet neighborhood. We had the octopus and crab cake as our starters. The octopus was tasty and el Dante inside. This was my first time ever having elk chop! I was blown away! The seasoning was great and the elk was cooked perfectly. The elk also wasn't too gamy paired perfectly with Turley Juvenile Zinfandel. What a little charm in the neighborhood!!Very welcomed restaurant in a historic Brooklyn Heights. Very well spaced distance between tables, attentive server and bus boys - followed all the distance rules. Food is amazing. Unique elk chops, soft shell crabs - this is what you have to come for! Salad was great too. Perfect portion size. Definitely must try.Nice setting and outdoor dining. Pretty good cocktails, and the octopus was well cooked. However, the entrees were lackluster. The salmon with mustard three ways was very exciting on the menu, but on the plate was just fish with some mustard sauce and garnish. The duck with mushrooms was disappointing - the mushrooms were basically stewed in a sweet brown gravy that I would expect to see in a cafeteria more than a restaurant.Came here for brunch. I ordered Tortilla Espanola and it comes with a side salad. I asked if i could sub it for anything else and they said no? They said I can only remove it and then I would have to order a side of somthing else? When my Tortilla came, it was tiny, maybe half a portion and it was dry. The salad that I didn't want was wilted. When the check came, I saw they charged me $4 for my gingerale???During these tough time this place delivers! They are doing ""Take Away"" and it is great!Wow.This place is an institution, and definitely one of the best places you can go to in the neighborhood for a real sit down meal.    They moved down the street from their old location but the food is the same and the atmosphere is better than before. In the fall their wild game menu is wild!  Year round the menu is filled with hits.  When my girlfriend goes a week without giving me a hard time this is where I bring her for date night, and they never disappoint us.Sit down have some wine and choose anything on the menu, you can't go wrong.The mustard chops weren't welcomed, thank you--I ordered the elk chops; they had an excessive, overpowering amount of mustard. I enjoy and can handle well spicy foods, but this was an overkill. I was tearing up, and couldn't taste the meat allegedly exquisite meat underneath the mustard. Shame on the chef!The black sea bass and the consommé were alright, to be fair.Nice Pinot Noir, ok.Overall:Bah.This place is awesome. I highly recommend! Great service, fresh ingredient, and food is just amazing. Bread, soup, salad, crab cake, salmon, steak, and tiramisu ImpeccableAmazing restaurant in Brooklyn Heights! will definitely be backWe have been coming here about annually for the past 10 years. It's a long trek from CT, but it's worth it. We love wild game and this place knows how to bring out the best in it. Walnut crusted chicken was so surprisingly delicious. The elk chop superb. The duck (both sour cherry sauce and ginger soy) were more than expected. The deserts are not a strong point here. Mediocre. Particularly in contrast to the strong medley of flavors in the main courses.

While neither dish looked too healthy, we didn't mind feeling a little bit guilty and promised each other that we will put extra efforts into our gym classes for the rest of the week.I have no idea how difficult it is to snag a reservation at Henry's End but the restaurant was mostly packed with local Brooklynites during our Wednesday meal so booking in advance seems like a good idea. As noted above, the décor and atmosphere of the restaurant might scare you off a little but I suggest that you get comfortable with embracing the old-school vibe of this place. The wine list at Henry's End was quite a surprise; I didn't expect to see so many bottles, many of them from California, from older vintages all the way to the 20th century at bargain prices. There are also daily wines by the glass available that you should take advantage of. Henry's End is one of those restaurants that if you live in the neighborhood you would want to come back again and again for a reliable dining experience. Jun and I certainly would love to come back again to try other dishes and explore the wine list.A true gem of Brooklyn Heights! A very unique menu featuring many fresh ""game"" meats (I.e rabbit, deer, duck, etc) which maintains unbelievable quality and is well worth the price. Food: I had ordered the a mixed plates with duck, rabbit, and venison and everything was impeccable. My friend described his chicken as best chicken if his life. Drinks: short but fantastic beer menu featuring local gems. I ordered wine special which was excellent and fairly priced.Service: really amazing service. Wait staff was very attentive and genuinely cares we were satisfied. Vibes: My favorite part of Henry's End is it is not pretentious. To have this level of food and service it is refreshing to have a relaxed unassuming atmosphere.Went here because they have ""game meat"" which sounded really interesting. Well, I finally had kangaroo - it was diced meat in a pasta wrap. Not really that interesting. Tasted like chicken.So that was sort of disappointing. Still, the food, ambience, and conversation was wonderful... we did have duck, and a few other interesting meats that were truly tasty.As non NYC folks in Brooklyn, we engaged with a man who did reviews of many many NYC area restaurants - he did a blog, and was into the many hundreds of restaurants.... he said this was one of his favorites.Overall, we had a great meal (twice) and had a great time. Good food, good wine, ate kangaroo... what more could you want? ;)This is a bold statement... but Henry's End may have one of the best menus in all of New York City.  Just go.  The end.My wife and I and friends have been coming to this restaurant for years.We are disappointed that the dishes now do not include rice and a few vegetables.  The cost is probably around 50 cents.  Dishes like mash potatoes which tasted like instant mashed potatoes do not go with Sole with Lobster.  Then there is the glare from the sun shining from the building right across from the restaurant. It's not like there is a fantastic view, there is no view.   Anyway the glare makes enjoying the experience very unpleasant to say the least.  Everyone would want to sit across from their loved one, not side by side.Then there is the wine.  Chardonnays that are eleven years old are usually not good as was the case with this wine.  They used to have very good wine at fairly high prices, now the wine is more expensive and is not a good quality.Then there is the atmosphere which is not the same as the previous location which was dark and romantic instead the new place is very bright and sterile.  Bring back the candles like they had before.And the wait staff has much to be desired.  They are not very friendly as in they take your order and someone else brings you your order.  The waiter did not even thank us for the tip!Non the less, the owner tries his best to be accommodating.  He does need to be open to installing some nice shades to cut down on the glare, improve his wine selection and include rice and vegetables with dishes as he did before.  Also I would suggest that he warmly greet his guests to make them feel special. Why do things have to change for the worst!Amazing food. Very traditional dishes and cozy ambiance. Anything you ask for is delicious. Wine list has plenty of great wines. Love the truffled French fries.Our friends from Brooklyn brought us here for dinner last night. My husband and I were blown away! I wasn't even hungry but the food was so amazing I cleaned my plate! The four of us all ordered completely different dishes and everything was so good! I had the Scottish Salmon which was cooked to perfection and melted in my mouth. My husband had the Steak Au Poivre which was also cooked to perfection and had such delicious flavor. The food is very fresh and the service is great. This will be a regular for us when we travel into Brooklyn!An old stand by on Henry Street in Brooklyn Heights consistently serving great food for many years. They also serve Game Meat every fall. You can't go wrong with what you order. The steaks are particularly very good.Welcomed very quickly and sat immediately. Felt the servers were a little inattentive once our order was placed. Food was amazing! A bit loud for good conversation but overall a great experienceABOMINABLE !I went to the old Henry's End through the 90s and early 2000s.I thought it would be exceptional enough for a friend's birthday dinner who I wanted to have good food and a good experience. That did not happen, and to a shocking extent. The food was revolting slop that looked like what you would find served in a prison, and (literally) toxic to an extent you would not EVEN find in a prison. I have never written (or felt compelled to write) anything like this--and the following--ever before.I made reservations a week before, discussed that it was a friend's birthday, and requested a good table as I was booking in advance. This meant nothing when arrived as we were sat in their new not very exceptional dining room, at one of the even less exceptional (or desirable) tables, just as if we walked in off the street. When I asked if a better table could be provided (there were a few better empty tables in the room) I was told no, and that people reserved the other tables THAT day. However, after a while we WE'RE given a less bad table and told ""people canceled"" as if a favor was being done for us.We started with drinks. I was given a martini on the rocks that was watered down from the ""couple"" if ice cubes in it. My friend's daiquiri was unrecognizable from any daiquiri EVER and tasted like nothing I have ever tasted even in the worst dive bar. She sent the drink back, and it was not the first thing that got rejected from our table during the evening. (I should have rejected everything.)I had started dinner with the Caesar salad, she, the Duck Mousse. The salad was 'OK' but the mousse was more a puree than mousse and came with the unwanted surprise of chutney mixed in the under portion of it. This was NOT listed in the menu description. We also both switched to wine knowing no ""mixing skill"" would be required. THIS is the least awful part of ""dinner.""The entrees came. We both ordered ""Braised Duck with Seasonal Wild Mushrooms, Shallots, Thyme, and Lingonberries."" My dinner companion ordered mashed potatoes, and I ordered sautéed spinach. The plates with the duck were non-descript brown heaps of sauce with something underneath. The spinach was swimming in water and the mashed potatoes were slopped onto the plate in lumpy mound. We each tasted our side dishes. Mine was at least not overcooked (I would suffer form having eaten it later.) Hers caused an expression on her face that caused me immediately to taste it. And I was APPALLED.It was a tasteless mountain of paste except for the overwhelming amount of SALT that had been DUMPED into it. She then tasted her duck, looked horrified, and said ""I cannot eat this."" I tasted it as well and it was horrendously tough, over cooked, and comprised (again) mostly of salt. This was to an extent I have never encountered before. If there were mushrooms, rice or shallots (described in the menu description) anywhere on the plate, I could not tell. Everything was mixed into an ugly overbearing brown sauce that was slathered over the inedible --equally ugly--brown carcass on her plate. BOTH of her dishes got sent back. Unfortunately, my friend's appetite was destroyed at this point and she said she could not eat anything else.MY duck was not so badly overcooked, but equally buried underan ugly, heavy brown sauce. Perhaps out of shook over encountering one horrible thing after another, I ate my duck along with my spinach. It was not good and I would pay for that--in a couple of ways. My paying with my health, continued the day after eating at Henry's End, by feeling extremely unwell and like I mainlined SALT.I convinced my friend to order dessert. She acquiesced. ANOTHER big mistake. Her ""Black and White Mousse"" was a thin layer of chocolate mousse under a thick layer of frozen cream. My Chocolate Hazelnut Cake was nothing you can't get in a diner, except for the ""extra"" taste of salt. This added to the toxic levels that at that point, had already been delivered into my system.I foolishly ordered coffee. The coffee had a ""burnt"" odor, and when I poured the cream into it, a curdle ""chunk"" plopped into the cup, sending little curdled particles of cream out in a ripple effect throughout the surface of the beverage.Today as last night, I pay with my health by still feeling ill from the mega does of salt I can still taste and was DUMPED in COPIUS amounts into almost everything served. I usually have no problem with salt. But today, the thought of it makes me feel ill. As I and my dinner companion both believe the duck was prepared MANY hours before it was served, it may have been left out to accumulate bacteria. That would account for how bad I felt the following day.I saved up for last night. If anyone thinks as I did--of their good memories of the old ""Henry's End"" with a mind towards going, there PLEASE reconsider.Shame on you Henry's End... for the last time I was there !Consistently a shining star of a Brooklyn dining experience. They are all about the customer- making you glad you chose to have a meal there. Service is tops as is the carefully crafted cuisine. While the food, service and atmosphere will be presenting you with finer dining, it is more relaxed and unfussy. There is a reason they have been around long enough to see other revered places come and go- they know what they do and they they do it well. This is the kind of place that you can easily enjoy a date or impress out of town guests that probably have pre-conceived notions of what Brooklyn dining is like. Once thing is for sure- not only will you leave satisfied, you'll probably already be planning your next visit.The outdoor dining was nice and cute with the lighting in a pretty quiet neighborhood. We had the octopus and crab cake as our starters. The octopus was tasty and el Dante inside. This was my first time ever having elk chop! I was blown away! The seasoning was great and the elk was cooked perfectly. The elk also wasn't too gamy paired perfectly with Turley Juvenile Zinfandel. What a little charm in the neighborhood!!Very welcomed restaurant in a historic Brooklyn Heights. Very well spaced distance between tables, attentive server and bus boys - followed all the distance rules. Food is amazing. Unique elk chops, soft shell crabs - this is what you have to come for! Salad was great too. Perfect portion size. Definitely must try.Nice setting and outdoor dining. Pretty good cocktails, and the octopus was well cooked. However, the entrees were lackluster. The salmon with mustard three ways was very exciting on the menu, but on the plate was just fish with some mustard sauce and garnish. The duck with mushrooms was disappointing - the mushrooms were basically stewed in a sweet brown gravy that I would expect to see in a cafeteria more than a restaurant.Came here for brunch. I ordered Tortilla Espanola and it comes with a side salad. I asked if i could sub it for anything else and they said no? They said I can only remove it and then I would have to order a side of somthing else? When my Tortilla came, it was tiny, maybe half a portion and it was dry. The salad that I didn't want was wilted. When the check came, I saw they charged me $4 for my gingerale???During these tough time this place delivers! They are doing ""Take Away"" and it is great!Wow.This place is an institution, and definitely one of the best places you can go to in the neighborhood for a real sit down meal.    They moved down the street from their old location but the food is the same and the atmosphere is better than before. In the fall their wild game menu is wild!  Year round the menu is filled with hits.  When my girlfriend goes a week without giving me a hard time this is where I bring her for date night, and they never disappoint us.Sit down have some wine and choose anything on the menu, you can't go wrong.The mustard chops weren't welcomed, thank you--I ordered the elk chops; they had an excessive, overpowering amount of mustard. I enjoy and can handle well spicy foods, but this was an overkill. I was tearing up, and couldn't taste the meat allegedly exquisite meat underneath the mustard. Shame on the chef!The black sea bass and the consommé were alright, to be fair.Nice Pinot Noir, ok.Overall:Bah.This place is awesome. I highly recommend! Great service, fresh ingredient, and food is just amazing. Bread, soup, salad, crab cake, salmon, steak, and tiramisu ImpeccableAmazing restaurant in Brooklyn Heights! will definitely be backWe have been coming here about annually for the past 10 years. It's a long trek from CT, but it's worth it. We love wild game and this place knows how to bring out the best in it. Walnut crusted chicken was so surprisingly delicious. The elk chop superb. The duck (both sour cherry sauce and ginger soy) were more than expected. The deserts are not a strong point here. Mediocre. Particularly in contrast to the strong medley of flavors in the main courses. Still, we will be back!KenScale: 8.0/10My wife Jun and I go on a double date from time to time with my former co-worker and her husband (an avid foodie) to check out new restaurants. Ever since the couple had a baby, it has become a bit more challenging to find a place that could work for the next restaurant trips. The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights so I asked them if there is any restaurant in their neighborhood that is convenient for them to meet up for dinner before the summer's end. The foodie husband said Henry's End which I had never heard of until that point was his all-time Brooklyn Heights favorite. I was certainly intrigued and took on their offer to come visit Brooklyn Heights to visit the restaurant. When Jun and I walked in, I had an impression at the moment that I was inside a dive bar with exposed bricks and a very quaint décor. Not that the venue's vibe really matters for me; Jun and I dislike places with fancy settings but food that turns out to be underwhelming more than places with humbling settings but have very delicious food. And surprisingly the food at Henry's End turned out to be quite good.The menu at Henry's End is a loose group of New American dishes with locally sourced ingredients and influences from different parts of the country. The dishes here tend to be on a more rustic side. Jun wished the sauce were slightly less sweet, but still very much enjoyed the barbecue ribs whose texture was more or less perfect. The shrimp sautéed with spicy Andouille sausage was also very nice for an appetizer, with a Southern style that was hearty and satisfying. Jun, always a duck meat aficionado, ordered the duckling honey-ginger that the foodie husband highly recommended. I stole some bites from the duckling and it was cooked quite aptly to give the texture that the duck meat must have to shine at a dinner table. On the other hand, the main dish that I had ordered, veal scallopine sautéed with roasted garlic, lemon, capers and basil, was a little bit too aggressive in the seasoning department even though the meat itself was gently prepared. Don't skip desserts at Henry's End! You have two different versions of mud pie, and the Mrs. Mud Pie version that Jun chose was absolutely decadent with vanilla and Heath Bar Crunch ice creams on a Graham Cracker crust, topped with hot butterscotch sauce. Same goes for the delightful Persian lime pie, consisting of fresh lime pastry cream on a Graham Cracker crust. While neither dish looked too healthy, we didn't mind feeling a little bit guilty and promised each other that we will put extra efforts into our gym classes for the rest of the week.I have no idea how difficult it is to snag a reservation at Henry's End but the restaurant was mostly packed with local Brooklynites during our Wednesday meal so booking in advance seems like a good idea.

So packed that we didn't think we were going to be able to get any seating. Luckily one of the workers saw us struggling and managed to find a table on the second floor and while it was a little tightly packed, it felt cozy and added to the ambience. Since the service/staff were friendly, it set the tone for the rest of the night. Got some Irish coffees, deviled eggs, pork sliders, and other drinks. Oysters were very good too!Fun spot in FiDi. Staff are friendly and attentive. They have drink specials and a few jugs of some sort of Tullamore Dew punch chilling on ice. Tried one... whew. Potent. The crowd seems to be a bit varied. I was in on a Saturday night so it was not happy hour for FiDi employees. The bottom floor is quite narrow as is many a bar in NYC. The selection is very good if you like brown liquor. I'm a vodka drinker so that was a bit less but they have the standards. The people coming in and out were 20 somethings and 30 somethings. The people who came and stayed were 40 somethings and up. Interesting selection of tunes. I'll be back!Soccer, Bud Light, & fantasy football...super popular things I simply don't get.  You can add the Dead Rabbit to that list.  The food, drinks, atmosphere, it's all good, but the prices (even for NYC) and how crowded it gets are huge negatives.  I suspect I will be back again and hope to have the same experience as others.  Maybe my expectations were simply too high.Good old bar. It has an old medieval feel to it. The Dead Rabbit has a few different sections. Each are unique but they're all charming. You can have an intimate chat or get rowdy. First floor you come to is the main bar. It has a great selection of beer. The Irish Red is the house selection. It's about $9 for a pint. Yes all the drinks are expensive, as they are at all the bars around this. Cocktails are about $18 each. That's more than a meal at most places. Also it's part of the reason why I haven't ordered any food. Another reason is because it's not exactly vegetarian friendly. They have a few salads but these are very pricey for some greens and tomatoes. I would come back to check out the other rooms here. The Parlor Room sounds particularly cool if you can get a reservation. You'll unfortunately be paying a lot more for the upstairs.Cane here for drinks on a Friday night and put our name  down immediately for the upstairs bar. The downstairs bar is like any other local bar but they had this Irish coffee that's warm and delicious especially in the winter. It's got like a cold foam on top but hot liquid on the bottom. I really enjoyed this hot drink and it was quite good. After about 45 minutes, the buzzer rang and we were able to go upstairs for a drink where it was more intimate and the cocktails were more unique. Shared 2 cocktailsPEACE PROCESS (HOT)SCOTCH WHISKY, JAMAICAN RUM, NUTMEG LIQUEUR, FERNET, WALNUT MILK, CHOCOLATESOUND AS A BELLIRISH WHISKEY, AMBER VERMOUTH, APPLE WINE, FIG LEAF, PASSIONFRUIT, CORN SILK TEA, BLACKSTRAP BITTERSOverall, the cocktails here are pricey but all well made. I particularly enjoyed all the hot drinks especially since it's winter time. Both cocktails I had were unique and the rest of the menu looks delicious as well. Come here if you're craving a unique cocktail.I had high hopes for this place as it was rated really well on one of those top bars in the world list. It was surprisingly empty when we went on a Saturday night, but I guess the FiDi crowd doesn't really go out at this time, and I get they closed awfully early for a bar (I think at like 2? With the late night menu starting pass midnight).The drinks were okay. My boyfriend got one of the lower level drinks and it tasted pretty light but was tasty as a smoothie (so-so as a cocktail). It had like Greek yogurt and coconut in it, and he liked it which was what matters.I got one of the higher level ones and it tasted a bit too much like Islay Scotch. It was too much that all you could taste was the peatiness and nothing else in the drink (in comparison to say a penicillin, where the peatiness just comes on the nose).Still had a great time there though and service was top notch. Our server refilled our waters on the clock!Great bar and super lively on a Saturday night! I stopped in around 8pm with a group of friends and luckily we were able to get a big table in the back on the first floor. It was super crowded and tightly packed but the table they gave us was like having our own private room! I only saw the first floor which had two rooms, a bar in each room. There is also an upstairs (which I heard is like a lounge) however when we went to check it out after dinner, the bouncer said it was too full. I ordered the vodka cocktail ($16) which was super refreshing. It tasted like a light cucumber summer cocktail; absolutely delicious! One of my friends got the Irish coffee ($14) which was also amazing. Not too strong; perfectly balanced! We ordered the deviled eggs with lobster ($15), truffle fries ($12) and the Guinness bread pudding dessert. The only thing I would not recommend was the bread pudding. It was very dry even with the ice cream on top. The menu was massive (see picture below), so you are bound to find something you enjoy!Our waitress was very patient and super friendly. She was able to split our check 4 ways and took a pic for the table. She recommended my cocktail drink and had the bartender make a custom mocktail for one of my friends (which she really enjoyed)! I will definitely be back here and would highly recommend this place!! Get here early to get a seat!Creative and interesting cocktail list that seems o frequently have new options, and great food (we especially love the stew).Ok the Irish coffee is 100% worth the hype. How do they make this magical drink? It's not at all bitter. In fact, it's dangerously smooth. That said it's not particularly strong or a large drink. But it's yuuuummmmy. The bar has an upstairs, but it was closed when we were there.We came at 10:30pm on a Wednesday and the bar was hopping. We found 2 seats at the bar. We left around 12:30, and the bar was packed. We didn't have any food, so I can't speak to that.I came here for a holiday party. The downstairs was extremely crowded, but luckily we had the third floor reserved. The space was cozy and intimate. I loved the Irish coffee cocktail. It's the perfect warm, boozy drink for winter and it's topped with a thick layer of sweet cream. Ask for it with nutmeg!The Dead Rabbit also provided catering for this party. The charcuterie spread provided a great selection of meats and cheeses. The lobster deviled eggs were meh. There wasn't enough lobster on them for me to be impressed. The short rib on the short rib sliders was very tender.Maybe not a great place if you're not into crowds, but perfect if you're looking to reserve a private room for a party! Service was friendly and attentive.Came in for drinks a couple times.  Solid cocktails and amazing Irish coffee.  Only thing we tried to eat was the devilled eggs with lobster, which was delicious.  Looked at what others were eating and everything looked good.  Will definitely be back to try some more foodGreat athmosphere and very good service.Such a cool place! Wanted to come for a long time and glad I finally made it. Came pretty early on a Saturday in November, maybe 5 pm, and it was already decently full. In the downstairs part it kind of reminds me of a fancier cocktail version of McSorley's with the old school decor and sawdust on the floor, but it's still really chill and not stuffy. There are two sides of the bar although there's more seating on the far side. We (3 of us) put our name down for a table and we luckily got one after 10-15 only which was nice because it was crowded enough to be uncomfortable standing if you didn't have a spot at the bar. Cocktails are inventive and fun and we didn't get food but it looked good.We then went upstairs after putting our name down and not waiting that long. Upstairs has such a different vibe, and this was the dead rabbit I was expecting. It's darker, quiet, and there are tables / seats for everyone with no loiterers or unnecessary crowds. This is where the menu looks like a graphic novel / dark comic book and I just absolutely loved it!! I couldn't read the whole thing at the time, but it also appeared to be part of a series so I didn't have the background, but I loved it all the same. Pages and pages of different cocktails went with the story (I think?) and were arranged from lightest to booziest. They were excellent and I loved everything about it. They also give you a little starter drink served in a tiny teacup, love!Then we went back downstairs after and met a few more people, and they got in no problem. Such a cool spot with two different vibes depending on what you're looking for, both awesome! Will be back if I'm in this neighborhood!Came here on a Friday night to get some beers and tried their deviled eggs with bacon ($10) and Lamb shepherd's pie ($20), which had curried lamb with potato puree. Both were pretty good and went well with the beers. They have a wide range of selection for cocktails and Irish whiskey, so I want to come back for those. The price point for foods and drinks here is a bit steep, but given that there aren't that many bars like this in FiDi area I guess that's where the value comes from. It's spacious and pretty big inside, but it's very crowded as it's a very popular spot. I liked the lively vibe even though, just like any other bars, it's extremely loud and hard to hear each other. However, I do recommend here if you're looking for a decent bar in the FiDi area!The Dead Rabbit is a great spot for drinks and food. Located in the Financial District,it's a mix between Irish pub and New York cocktail bar.The first floor with its lively bar, is crowded and loud, but it's part of the charm, making it inviting, warm and non-pretentious. After enjoying a couple cocktails and admiring the bartenders expertise, I can see how this place was named the best in the world.  Each cocktail is a minutious mix of ingredients expertly picked from mysterious small bottles seating right behind the bar.  I wonder how how long it must take to master this craft.The food is also prepared with care, offering Irish fare, perfect to go with your craft beer, or cocktail.  I recommend getting a selection of Irish breads to eat with your oysters or to just savour by itself, yummy!Really, everything from the food, the drinks and the atmosphere was perfect.I work in the area yet never spend time around FiDi. I decided to finally give The Dead Rabbit a shot, and it didn't let me down. I went with a co-worker, we both ordered food and drinks. I tried one of the signature cocktails, I believe The Trailblazer (has mezcal), then asked for a margarita after. Both drinks were solid, but my marg seemed very weak.. We shared oysters, they were fresh and delicious; truffle fries (perfect), and the fish and chips weren't too oily or chewy. The history of the pub is made clear throughout, which I always love coming from long-standing businesses in NY. Staff was friendly and prompt, even on a Friday night after work. Yes, busy, but we had a great time and would definitely go back.This place is an absolute gem. It's in a neighborhood (FiDi) that I have no other reason to be in, ever - but Dead Rabbit is one of those destination spots you go out of your way to visit. There's good reason for the wait times to get in: everything from the unique craft cocktails, to the ambiance, to service is consistently stellar. On our most recent trip, for my husband's birthday, we went upstairs to the parlor to enjoy some after-dinner drinks. So delicious. I was torn between slowly sipping my drink (Panic Attack) to truly savor all the fresh, distinctive flavors... and wanting to quickly guzzle down all that liquid yumminess all at once. We both ended our evening with their famed Irish coffee, which is nothing short of epic. The Dead Rabbit mixologists have TRULY nailed this drink down to an art form. The coffee- and whiskey-based concoction has the PERFECT, comforting degree of warmth, and is then topped with this refreshingly cool layer of homemade whipped cream. The pairing together of warm and cool on your tastebuds is just such a treat. My husband said this drink was like liquid dessert!Can't wait to return. I haven't tried their food yet, and have my sights set squarely on those truffle fries.It is telling that myself and my friends, in a brief trip to New York City -wherein one may find so many, many options for food and drink, and perhaps feel obligated to explore as many as possible- would pay our tab and abandon a restaurant miles to the north, then trudge through the cold to catch the subway down to Water Street in order to visit Dead Rabbit for a second time in three days.The first visit was a screaming success. Holding fond memories of previous trips, we sensibly posted up on the front step a short while before the doors were scheduled to open on St. Patrick's day and grabbed one of the tiny tables downstairs before the rush hit [three separate groups were fighting over the table while we paid our tab that day]. Full Irish breakfasts and a few cocktails and shots of whiskey later -courtesy of the Excellent advice of the Lovely [and very Irish] waitstaff, I have a new favorite whiskey- we eeled our way out through the press of eager green-clad celebrants, incredibly satisfied.Fast forward a few days later: it is no less crowded as we wiggle our way back in and get on the waitlist for a table upstairs for a late dinner. The general hubbub is enough to make your head spin if the well-balanced but heavy-hitting drinks don't do the job already, but it's a warm, welcoming feeling. The bartenders are a delight to talk to and order from- the best at their trade, they manage cheerful conversation and have sound recommendations and creative suggestions for the drinks, which can get overwhelming in the cocktail lounge [it's a brilliant menu, and an entertaining read]. The food is invariably delicious, even if you just get the crudites [tasty dip, crunchy celery, nice olives and so on] but i personally recommend the toasty. It's a brilliant grilled cheese and eating it was sort of the culinary equivalent of a hug.Any way. I could wax on about this place for ages, so I'll stop here. I just wish I lived closer.My husband and I popped into The Dead Rabbit on a gorgeous Sunday afternoon and we were super excited to have our choice of seating either upstairs or down. I liked the vibe of the downstairs so we grabbed two seats at the bar and perused the menu. At a cocktail mecca such as this, I was a little nervous to ask about non-alcoholic selections, but the bartender said she could make me something based on the flavors I like. I told her I like simple, not overly sweet concoctions and I especially enjoy mules. This woman made me the most delicious version of a booze-free moscow mule that I have ever tasted! It was so smooth and tasted much more complex than a simple ginger beer with lime. I don't know what she did but it was magic! We also decided to order the fries, which came with a few different dipping sauces. They were absolutely delicious, and the curry ketchup that came with was fantastic! Great place to spend some time, especially if you can get there when it's quiet.Dead Rabbit is just a step off of the fairy dock on Wall Street.  We wandered in for a drink before heading back to our hotel.  What I found out is that they are known for their mixed drinks and location was used in the movie bar scene ""Gangs of New York"" and one of those gangs was known as the ""Dead Rabbits"".  I guess someone threw a dead rabbit into their hang out.  It was packed on a Monday night, we still found seats at the bar.  Very loud music is played.  I had the Irish Coffee which was literally to die for.  Irish cream foam cap and with every sip of coffee on the bottom you got the delicious Irish cream foam in the sip.  Just awesome.  The friends with me had a Rueben sandwich or something similar to a Rueben.  It isn't on the menu but boy was that sandwich beautiful.  Only complaint is just cuz you come in as a group of 3 doesn't mean that it should be one bar bill.  I find that frustrating when 3 adults are assumed to be dating and it's my problem to work that out.  Now I know for next time to immediately say ""separate checks please!""{Overall: 4; Drinks: 4} Atmosphere: 3.5; Service: 4Awesome cocktails, main drawback is that it's a small space that can get crowded pretty easily. If you can get a spot at the bar you're golden, but might take a little waiting if you're going at a popular time.This is a pre-COVID review but the place was PACKED. So packed that we didn't think we were going to be able to get any seating. Luckily one of the workers saw us struggling and managed to find a table on the second floor and while it was a little tightly packed, it felt cozy and added to the ambience. Since the service/staff were friendly, it set the tone for the rest of the night. Got some Irish coffees, deviled eggs, pork sliders, and other drinks. Oysters were very good too!Fun spot in FiDi. Staff are friendly and attentive. They have drink specials and a few jugs of some sort of Tullamore Dew punch chilling on ice. Tried one... whew. Potent. The crowd seems to be a bit varied. I was in on a Saturday night so it was not happy hour for FiDi employees. The bottom floor is quite narrow as is many a bar in NYC. The selection is very good if you like brown liquor. I'm a vodka drinker so that was a bit less but they have the standards. The people coming in and out were 20 somethings and 30 somethings. The people who came and stayed were 40 somethings and up. Interesting selection of tunes. I'll be back!Soccer, Bud Light, & fantasy football...super popular things I simply don't get.  You can add the Dead Rabbit to that list.  The food, drinks, atmosphere, it's all good, but the prices (even for NYC) and how crowded it gets are huge negatives.  I suspect I will be back again and hope to have the same experience as others.  Maybe my expectations were simply too high.Good old bar. It has an old medieval feel to it. The Dead Rabbit has a few different sections. Each are unique but they're all charming. You can have an intimate chat or get rowdy. First floor you come to is the main bar. It has a great selection of beer. The Irish Red is the house selection. It's about $9 for a pint. Yes all the drinks are expensive, as they are at all the bars around this. Cocktails are about $18 each. That's more than a meal at most places. Also it's part of the reason why I haven't ordered any food. Another reason is because it's not exactly vegetarian friendly. They have a few salads but these are very pricey for some greens and tomatoes. I would come back to check out the other rooms here. The Parlor Room sounds particularly cool if you can get a reservation. You'll unfortunately be paying a lot more for the upstairs.Cane here for drinks on a Friday night and put our name  down immediately for the upstairs bar. The downstairs bar is like any other local bar but they had this Irish coffee that's warm and delicious especially in the winter. It's got like a cold foam on top but hot liquid on the bottom. I really enjoyed this hot drink and it was quite good. After about 45 minutes, the buzzer rang and we were able to go upstairs for a drink where it was more intimate and the cocktails were more unique. Shared 2 cocktailsPEACE PROCESS (HOT)SCOTCH WHISKY, JAMAICAN RUM, NUTMEG LIQUEUR, FERNET, WALNUT MILK, CHOCOLATESOUND AS A BELLIRISH WHISKEY, AMBER VERMOUTH, APPLE WINE, FIG LEAF, PASSIONFRUIT, CORN SILK TEA, BLACKSTRAP BITTERSOverall, the cocktails here are pricey but all well made. I particularly enjoyed all the hot drinks especially since it's winter time. Both cocktails I had were unique and the rest of the menu looks delicious as well. Come here if you're craving a unique cocktail.I had high hopes for this place as it was rated really well on one of those top bars in the world list. It was surprisingly empty when we went on a Saturday night, but I guess the FiDi crowd doesn't really go out at this time, and I get they closed awfully early for a bar (I think at like 2? With the late night menu starting pass midnight).The drinks were okay. My boyfriend got one of the lower level drinks and it tasted pretty light but was tasty as a smoothie (so-so as a cocktail). It had like Greek yogurt and coconut in it, and he liked it which was what matters.I got one of the higher level ones and it tasted a bit too much like Islay Scotch. It was too much that all you could taste was the peatiness and nothing else in the drink (in comparison to say a penicillin, where the peatiness just comes on the nose).Still had a great time there though and service was top notch. Our server refilled our waters on the clock!Great bar and super lively on a Saturday night! I stopped in around 8pm with a group of friends and luckily we were able to get a big table in the back on the first floor. It was super crowded and tightly packed but the table they gave us was like having our own private room! I only saw the first floor which had two rooms, a bar in each room. There is also an upstairs (which I heard is like a lounge) however when we went to check it out after dinner, the bouncer said it was too full. I ordered the vodka cocktail ($16) which was super refreshing. It tasted like a light cucumber summer cocktail; absolutely delicious! One of my friends got the Irish coffee ($14) which was also amazing. Not too strong; perfectly balanced! We ordered the deviled eggs with lobster ($15), truffle fries ($12) and the Guinness bread pudding dessert. The only thing I would not recommend was the bread pudding. It was very dry even with the ice cream on top. The menu was massive (see picture below), so you are bound to find something you enjoy!Our waitress was very patient and super friendly. She was able to split our check 4 ways and took a pic for the table. She recommended my cocktail drink and had the bartender make a custom mocktail for one of my friends (which she really enjoyed)! I will definitely be back here and would highly recommend this place!! Get here early to get a seat!Creative and interesting cocktail list that seems o frequently have new options, and great food (we especially love the stew).Ok the Irish coffee is 100% worth the hype. How do they make this magical drink? It's not at all bitter. In fact, it's dangerously smooth. That said it's not particularly strong or a large drink. But it's yuuuummmmy. The bar has an upstairs, but it was closed when we were there.We came at 10:30pm on a Wednesday and the bar was hopping. We found 2 seats at the bar. We left around 12:30, and the bar was packed. We didn't have any food, so I can't speak to that.I came here for a holiday party. The downstairs was extremely crowded, but luckily we had the third floor reserved. The space was cozy and intimate. I loved the Irish coffee cocktail. It's the perfect warm, boozy drink for winter and it's topped with a thick layer of sweet cream. Ask for it with nutmeg!The Dead Rabbit also provided catering for this party. The charcuterie spread provided a great selection of meats and cheeses. The lobster deviled eggs were meh. There wasn't enough lobster on them for me to be impressed. The short rib on the short rib sliders was very tender.Maybe not a great place if you're not into crowds, but perfect if you're looking to reserve a private room for a party! Service was friendly and attentive.Came in for drinks a couple times.  Solid cocktails and amazing Irish coffee.  Only thing we tried to eat was the devilled eggs with lobster, which was delicious.  Looked at what others were eating and everything looked good.  Will definitely be back to try some more foodGreat athmosphere and very good service.Such a cool place!

In the downstairs part it kind of reminds me of a fancier cocktail version of McSorley's with the old school decor and sawdust on the floor, but it's still really chill and not stuffy. There are two sides of the bar although there's more seating on the far side. We (3 of us) put our name down for a table and we luckily got one after 10-15 only which was nice because it was crowded enough to be uncomfortable standing if you didn't have a spot at the bar. Cocktails are inventive and fun and we didn't get food but it looked good.We then went upstairs after putting our name down and not waiting that long. Upstairs has such a different vibe, and this was the dead rabbit I was expecting. It's darker, quiet, and there are tables / seats for everyone with no loiterers or unnecessary crowds. This is where the menu looks like a graphic novel / dark comic book and I just absolutely loved it!! I couldn't read the whole thing at the time, but it also appeared to be part of a series so I didn't have the background, but I loved it all the same. Pages and pages of different cocktails went with the story (I think?) and were arranged from lightest to booziest. They were excellent and I loved everything about it. They also give you a little starter drink served in a tiny teacup, love!Then we went back downstairs after and met a few more people, and they got in no problem. Such a cool spot with two different vibes depending on what you're looking for, both awesome! Will be back if I'm in this neighborhood!Came here on a Friday night to get some beers and tried their deviled eggs with bacon ($10) and Lamb shepherd's pie ($20), which had curried lamb with potato puree. Both were pretty good and went well with the beers. They have a wide range of selection for cocktails and Irish whiskey, so I want to come back for those. The price point for foods and drinks here is a bit steep, but given that there aren't that many bars like this in FiDi area I guess that's where the value comes from. It's spacious and pretty big inside, but it's very crowded as it's a very popular spot. I liked the lively vibe even though, just like any other bars, it's extremely loud and hard to hear each other. However, I do recommend here if you're looking for a decent bar in the FiDi area!The Dead Rabbit is a great spot for drinks and food. Located in the Financial District,it's a mix between Irish pub and New York cocktail bar.The first floor with its lively bar, is crowded and loud, but it's part of the charm, making it inviting, warm and non-pretentious. After enjoying a couple cocktails and admiring the bartenders expertise, I can see how this place was named the best in the world.  Each cocktail is a minutious mix of ingredients expertly picked from mysterious small bottles seating right behind the bar.  I wonder how how long it must take to master this craft.The food is also prepared with care, offering Irish fare, perfect to go with your craft beer, or cocktail.  I recommend getting a selection of Irish breads to eat with your oysters or to just savour by itself, yummy!Really, everything from the food, the drinks and the atmosphere was perfect.I work in the area yet never spend time around FiDi. I decided to finally give The Dead Rabbit a shot, and it didn't let me down. I went with a co-worker, we both ordered food and drinks. I tried one of the signature cocktails, I believe The Trailblazer (has mezcal), then asked for a margarita after. Both drinks were solid, but my marg seemed very weak.. We shared oysters, they were fresh and delicious; truffle fries (perfect), and the fish and chips weren't too oily or chewy. The history of the pub is made clear throughout, which I always love coming from long-standing businesses in NY. Staff was friendly and prompt, even on a Friday night after work. Yes, busy, but we had a great time and would definitely go back.This place is an absolute gem. It's in a neighborhood (FiDi) that I have no other reason to be in, ever - but Dead Rabbit is one of those destination spots you go out of your way to visit. There's good reason for the wait times to get in: everything from the unique craft cocktails, to the ambiance, to service is consistently stellar. On our most recent trip, for my husband's birthday, we went upstairs to the parlor to enjoy some after-dinner drinks. So delicious. I was torn between slowly sipping my drink (Panic Attack) to truly savor all the fresh, distinctive flavors... and wanting to quickly guzzle down all that liquid yumminess all at once. We both ended our evening with their famed Irish coffee, which is nothing short of epic. The Dead Rabbit mixologists have TRULY nailed this drink down to an art form. The coffee- and whiskey-based concoction has the PERFECT, comforting degree of warmth, and is then topped with this refreshingly cool layer of homemade whipped cream. The pairing together of warm and cool on your tastebuds is just such a treat. My husband said this drink was like liquid dessert!Can't wait to return. I haven't tried their food yet, and have my sights set squarely on those truffle fries.It is telling that myself and my friends, in a brief trip to New York City -wherein one may find so many, many options for food and drink, and perhaps feel obligated to explore as many as possible- would pay our tab and abandon a restaurant miles to the north, then trudge through the cold to catch the subway down to Water Street in order to visit Dead Rabbit for a second time in three days.The first visit was a screaming success. Holding fond memories of previous trips, we sensibly posted up on the front step a short while before the doors were scheduled to open on St. Patrick's day and grabbed one of the tiny tables downstairs before the rush hit [three separate groups were fighting over the table while we paid our tab that day]. Full Irish breakfasts and a few cocktails and shots of whiskey later -courtesy of the Excellent advice of the Lovely [and very Irish] waitstaff, I have a new favorite whiskey- we eeled our way out through the press of eager green-clad celebrants, incredibly satisfied.Fast forward a few days later: it is no less crowded as we wiggle our way back in and get on the waitlist for a table upstairs for a late dinner. The general hubbub is enough to make your head spin if the well-balanced but heavy-hitting drinks don't do the job already, but it's a warm, welcoming feeling. The bartenders are a delight to talk to and order from- the best at their trade, they manage cheerful conversation and have sound recommendations and creative suggestions for the drinks, which can get overwhelming in the cocktail lounge [it's a brilliant menu, and an entertaining read]. The food is invariably delicious, even if you just get the crudites [tasty dip, crunchy celery, nice olives and so on] but i personally recommend the toasty. It's a brilliant grilled cheese and eating it was sort of the culinary equivalent of a hug.Any way. I could wax on about this place for ages, so I'll stop here. I just wish I lived closer.My husband and I popped into The Dead Rabbit on a gorgeous Sunday afternoon and we were super excited to have our choice of seating either upstairs or down. I liked the vibe of the downstairs so we grabbed two seats at the bar and perused the menu. At a cocktail mecca such as this, I was a little nervous to ask about non-alcoholic selections, but the bartender said she could make me something based on the flavors I like. I told her I like simple, not overly sweet concoctions and I especially enjoy mules. This woman made me the most delicious version of a booze-free moscow mule that I have ever tasted! It was so smooth and tasted much more complex than a simple ginger beer with lime. I don't know what she did but it was magic! We also decided to order the fries, which came with a few different dipping sauces. They were absolutely delicious, and the curry ketchup that came with was fantastic! Great place to spend some time, especially if you can get there when it's quiet.Dead Rabbit is just a step off of the fairy dock on Wall Street.  We wandered in for a drink before heading back to our hotel.  What I found out is that they are known for their mixed drinks and location was used in the movie bar scene ""Gangs of New York"" and one of those gangs was known as the ""Dead Rabbits"".  I guess someone threw a dead rabbit into their hang out.  It was packed on a Monday night, we still found seats at the bar.  Very loud music is played.  I had the Irish Coffee which was literally to die for.  Irish cream foam cap and with every sip of coffee on the bottom you got the delicious Irish cream foam in the sip.  Just awesome.  The friends with me had a Rueben sandwich or something similar to a Rueben.  It isn't on the menu but boy was that sandwich beautiful.  Only complaint is just cuz you come in as a group of 3 doesn't mean that it should be one bar bill.  I find that frustrating when 3 adults are assumed to be dating and it's my problem to work that out.  Now I know for next time to immediately say ""separate checks please!""{Overall: 4; Drinks: 4} Atmosphere: 3.5; Service: 4Awesome cocktails, main drawback is that it's a small space that can get crowded pretty easily. If you can get a spot at the bar you're golden, but might take a little waiting if you're going at a popular time.This is a pre-COVID review but the place was PACKED. So packed that we didn't think we were going to be able to get any seating. Luckily one of the workers saw us struggling and managed to find a table on the second floor and while it was a little tightly packed, it felt cozy and added to the ambience. Since the service/staff were friendly, it set the tone for the rest of the night. Got some Irish coffees, deviled eggs, pork sliders, and other drinks. Oysters were very good too!Fun spot in FiDi. Staff are friendly and attentive. They have drink specials and a few jugs of some sort of Tullamore Dew punch chilling on ice. Tried one... whew. Potent. The crowd seems to be a bit varied. I was in on a Saturday night so it was not happy hour for FiDi employees. The bottom floor is quite narrow as is many a bar in NYC. The selection is very good if you like brown liquor. I'm a vodka drinker so that was a bit less but they have the standards. The people coming in and out were 20 somethings and 30 somethings. The people who came and stayed were 40 somethings and up. Interesting selection of tunes. I'll be back!Soccer, Bud Light, & fantasy football...super popular things I simply don't get.  You can add the Dead Rabbit to that list.  The food, drinks, atmosphere, it's all good, but the prices (even for NYC) and how crowded it gets are huge negatives.  I suspect I will be back again and hope to have the same experience as others.  Maybe my expectations were simply too high.Good old bar. It has an old medieval feel to it. The Dead Rabbit has a few different sections. Each are unique but they're all charming. You can have an intimate chat or get rowdy. First floor you come to is the main bar. It has a great selection of beer. The Irish Red is the house selection. It's about $9 for a pint. Yes all the drinks are expensive, as they are at all the bars around this. Cocktails are about $18 each. That's more than a meal at most places. Also it's part of the reason why I haven't ordered any food. Another reason is because it's not exactly vegetarian friendly. They have a few salads but these are very pricey for some greens and tomatoes. I would come back to check out the other rooms here. The Parlor Room sounds particularly cool if you can get a reservation. You'll unfortunately be paying a lot more for the upstairs.Cane here for drinks on a Friday night and put our name  down immediately for the upstairs bar. The downstairs bar is like any other local bar but they had this Irish coffee that's warm and delicious especially in the winter. It's got like a cold foam on top but hot liquid on the bottom. I really enjoyed this hot drink and it was quite good. After about 45 minutes, the buzzer rang and we were able to go upstairs for a drink where it was more intimate and the cocktails were more unique. Shared 2 cocktailsPEACE PROCESS (HOT)SCOTCH WHISKY, JAMAICAN RUM, NUTMEG LIQUEUR, FERNET, WALNUT MILK, CHOCOLATESOUND AS A BELLIRISH WHISKEY, AMBER VERMOUTH, APPLE WINE, FIG LEAF, PASSIONFRUIT, CORN SILK TEA, BLACKSTRAP BITTERSOverall, the cocktails here are pricey but all well made. I particularly enjoyed all the hot drinks especially since it's winter time. Both cocktails I had were unique and the rest of the menu looks delicious as well. Come here if you're craving a unique cocktail.I had high hopes for this place as it was rated really well on one of those top bars in the world list. It was surprisingly empty when we went on a Saturday night, but I guess the FiDi crowd doesn't really go out at this time, and I get they closed awfully early for a bar (I think at like 2? With the late night menu starting pass midnight).The drinks were okay. My boyfriend got one of the lower level drinks and it tasted pretty light but was tasty as a smoothie (so-so as a cocktail). It had like Greek yogurt and coconut in it, and he liked it which was what matters.I got one of the higher level ones and it tasted a bit too much like Islay Scotch. It was too much that all you could taste was the peatiness and nothing else in the drink (in comparison to say a penicillin, where the peatiness just comes on the nose).Still had a great time there though and service was top notch. Our server refilled our waters on the clock!Great bar and super lively on a Saturday night! I stopped in around 8pm with a group of friends and luckily we were able to get a big table in the back on the first floor. It was super crowded and tightly packed but the table they gave us was like having our own private room! I only saw the first floor which had two rooms, a bar in each room. There is also an upstairs (which I heard is like a lounge) however when we went to check it out after dinner, the bouncer said it was too full. I ordered the vodka cocktail ($16) which was super refreshing. It tasted like a light cucumber summer cocktail; absolutely delicious! One of my friends got the Irish coffee ($14) which was also amazing. Not too strong; perfectly balanced! We ordered the deviled eggs with lobster ($15), truffle fries ($12) and the Guinness bread pudding dessert. The only thing I would not recommend was the bread pudding. It was very dry even with the ice cream on top. The menu was massive (see picture below), so you are bound to find something you enjoy!Our waitress was very patient and super friendly. She was able to split our check 4 ways and took a pic for the table. She recommended my cocktail drink and had the bartender make a custom mocktail for one of my friends (which she really enjoyed)! I will definitely be back here and would highly recommend this place!! Get here early to get a seat!Creative and interesting cocktail list that seems o frequently have new options, and great food (we especially love the stew).Ok the Irish coffee is 100% worth the hype. How do they make this magical drink? It's not at all bitter. In fact, it's dangerously smooth. That said it's not particularly strong or a large drink. But it's yuuuummmmy. The bar has an upstairs, but it was closed when we were there.We came at 10:30pm on a Wednesday and the bar was hopping. We found 2 seats at the bar. We left around 12:30, and the bar was packed. We didn't have any food, so I can't speak to that.I came here for a holiday party. The downstairs was extremely crowded, but luckily we had the third floor reserved. The space was cozy and intimate. I loved the Irish coffee cocktail. It's the perfect warm, boozy drink for winter and it's topped with a thick layer of sweet cream. Ask for it with nutmeg!The Dead Rabbit also provided catering for this party. The charcuterie spread provided a great selection of meats and cheeses. The lobster deviled eggs were meh. There wasn't enough lobster on them for me to be impressed. The short rib on the short rib sliders was very tender.Maybe not a great place if you're not into crowds, but perfect if you're looking to reserve a private room for a party! Service was friendly and attentive.Came in for drinks a couple times.  Solid cocktails and amazing Irish coffee.  Only thing we tried to eat was the devilled eggs with lobster, which was delicious.  Looked at what others were eating and everything looked good.  Will definitely be back to try some more foodGreat athmosphere and very good service.Such a cool place!

In the downstairs part it kind of reminds me of a fancier cocktail version of McSorley's with the old school decor and sawdust on the floor, but it's still really chill and not stuffy. There are two sides of the bar although there's more seating on the far side. We (3 of us) put our name down for a table and we luckily got one after 10-15 only which was nice because it was crowded enough to be uncomfortable standing if you didn't have a spot at the bar. Cocktails are inventive and fun and we didn't get food but it looked good.We then went upstairs after putting our name down and not waiting that long. Upstairs has such a different vibe, and this was the dead rabbit I was expecting. It's darker, quiet, and there are tables / seats for everyone with no loiterers or unnecessary crowds. This is where the menu looks like a graphic novel / dark comic book and I just absolutely loved it!! I couldn't read the whole thing at the time, but it also appeared to be part of a series so I didn't have the background, but I loved it all the same. Pages and pages of different cocktails went with the story (I think?) and were arranged from lightest to booziest. They were excellent and I loved everything about it. They also give you a little starter drink served in a tiny teacup, love!Then we went back downstairs after and met a few more people, and they got in no problem. Such a cool spot with two different vibes depending on what you're looking for, both awesome! Will be back if I'm in this neighborhood!Came here on a Friday night to get some beers and tried their deviled eggs with bacon ($10) and Lamb shepherd's pie ($20), which had curried lamb with potato puree. Both were pretty good and went well with the beers. They have a wide range of selection for cocktails and Irish whiskey, so I want to come back for those. The price point for foods and drinks here is a bit steep, but given that there aren't that many bars like this in FiDi area I guess that's where the value comes from. It's spacious and pretty big inside, but it's very crowded as it's a very popular spot. I liked the lively vibe even though, just like any other bars, it's extremely loud and hard to hear each other. However, I do recommend here if you're looking for a decent bar in the FiDi area!The Dead Rabbit is a great spot for drinks and food. Located in the Financial District,it's a mix between Irish pub and New York cocktail bar.The first floor with its lively bar, is crowded and loud, but it's part of the charm, making it inviting, warm and non-pretentious. After enjoying a couple cocktails and admiring the bartenders expertise, I can see how this place was named the best in the world.  Each cocktail is a minutious mix of ingredients expertly picked from mysterious small bottles seating right behind the bar.  I wonder how how long it must take to master this craft.The food is also prepared with care, offering Irish fare, perfect to go with your craft beer, or cocktail.  I recommend getting a selection of Irish breads to eat with your oysters or to just savour by itself, yummy!Really, everything from the food, the drinks and the atmosphere was perfect.I work in the area yet never spend time around FiDi. I decided to finally give The Dead Rabbit a shot, and it didn't let me down. I went with a co-worker, we both ordered food and drinks. I tried one of the signature cocktails, I believe The Trailblazer (has mezcal), then asked for a margarita after. Both drinks were solid, but my marg seemed very weak.. We shared oysters, they were fresh and delicious; truffle fries (perfect), and the fish and chips weren't too oily or chewy. The history of the pub is made clear throughout, which I always love coming from long-standing businesses in NY. Staff was friendly and prompt, even on a Friday night after work. Yes, busy, but we had a great time and would definitely go back.This place is an absolute gem. It's in a neighborhood (FiDi) that I have no other reason to be in, ever - but Dead Rabbit is one of those destination spots you go out of your way to visit. There's good reason for the wait times to get in: everything from the unique craft cocktails, to the ambiance, to service is consistently stellar. On our most recent trip, for my husband's birthday, we went upstairs to the parlor to enjoy some after-dinner drinks. So delicious. I was torn between slowly sipping my drink (Panic Attack) to truly savor all the fresh, distinctive flavors... and wanting to quickly guzzle down all that liquid yumminess all at once. We both ended our evening with their famed Irish coffee, which is nothing short of epic. The Dead Rabbit mixologists have TRULY nailed this drink down to an art form. The coffee- and whiskey-based concoction has the PERFECT, comforting degree of warmth, and is then topped with this refreshingly cool layer of homemade whipped cream. The pairing together of warm and cool on your tastebuds is just such a treat. My husband said this drink was like liquid dessert!Can't wait to return. I haven't tried their food yet, and have my sights set squarely on those truffle fries.It is telling that myself and my friends, in a brief trip to New York City -wherein one may find so many, many options for food and drink, and perhaps feel obligated to explore as many as possible- would pay our tab and abandon a restaurant miles to the north, then trudge through the cold to catch the subway down to Water Street in order to visit Dead Rabbit for a second time in three days.The first visit was a screaming success. Holding fond memories of previous trips, we sensibly posted up on the front step a short while before the doors were scheduled to open on St. Patrick's day and grabbed one of the tiny tables downstairs before the rush hit [three separate groups were fighting over the table while we paid our tab that day]. Full Irish breakfasts and a few cocktails and shots of whiskey later -courtesy of the Excellent advice of the Lovely [and very Irish] waitstaff, I have a new favorite whiskey- we eeled our way out through the press of eager green-clad celebrants, incredibly satisfied.Fast forward a few days later: it is no less crowded as we wiggle our way back in and get on the waitlist for a table upstairs for a late dinner. The general hubbub is enough to make your head spin if the well-balanced but heavy-hitting drinks don't do the job already, but it's a warm, welcoming feeling. The bartenders are a delight to talk to and order from- the best at their trade, they manage cheerful conversation and have sound recommendations and creative suggestions for the drinks, which can get overwhelming in the cocktail lounge [it's a brilliant menu, and an entertaining read]. The food is invariably delicious, even if you just get the crudites [tasty dip, crunchy celery, nice olives and so on] but i personally recommend the toasty. It's a brilliant grilled cheese and eating it was sort of the culinary equivalent of a hug.Any way. I could wax on about this place for ages, so I'll stop here. I just wish I lived closer.My husband and I popped into The Dead Rabbit on a gorgeous Sunday afternoon and we were super excited to have our choice of seating either upstairs or down. I liked the vibe of the downstairs so we grabbed two seats at the bar and perused the menu. At a cocktail mecca such as this, I was a little nervous to ask about non-alcoholic selections, but the bartender said she could make me something based on the flavors I like. I told her I like simple, not overly sweet concoctions and I especially enjoy mules. This woman made me the most delicious version of a booze-free moscow mule that I have ever tasted! It was so smooth and tasted much more complex than a simple ginger beer with lime. I don't know what she did but it was magic! We also decided to order the fries, which came with a few different dipping sauces. They were absolutely delicious, and the curry ketchup that came with was fantastic! Great place to spend some time, especially if you can get there when it's quiet.Dead Rabbit is just a step off of the fairy dock on Wall Street.  We wandered in for a drink before heading back to our hotel.  What I found out is that they are known for their mixed drinks and location was used in the movie bar scene ""Gangs of New York"" and one of those gangs was known as the ""Dead Rabbits"".  I guess someone threw a dead rabbit into their hang out.  It was packed on a Monday night, we still found seats at the bar.  Very loud music is played.  I had the Irish Coffee which was literally to die for.  Irish cream foam cap and with every sip of coffee on the bottom you got the delicious Irish cream foam in the sip.  Just awesome.  The friends with me had a Rueben sandwich or something similar to a Rueben.  It isn't on the menu but boy was that sandwich beautiful.  Only complaint is just cuz you come in as a group of 3 doesn't mean that it should be one bar bill.  I find that frustrating when 3 adults are assumed to be dating and it's my problem to work that out.  Now I know for next time to immediately say ""separate checks please!""{Overall: 4; Drinks: 4} Atmosphere: 3.5; Service: 4Awesome cocktails, main drawback is that it's a small space that can get crowded pretty easily. If you can get a spot at the bar you're golden, but might take a little waiting if you're going at a popular time.This is a pre-COVID review but the place was PACKED. So packed that we didn't think we were going to be able to get any seating. Luckily one of the workers saw us struggling and managed to find a table on the second floor and while it was a little tightly packed, it felt cozy and added to the ambience. Since the service/staff were friendly, it set the tone for the rest of the night. Got some Irish coffees, deviled eggs, pork sliders, and other drinks. Oysters were very good too!Fun spot in FiDi. Staff are friendly and attentive. They have drink specials and a few jugs of some sort of Tullamore Dew punch chilling on ice. Tried one... whew. Potent. The crowd seems to be a bit varied. I was in on a Saturday night so it was not happy hour for FiDi employees. The bottom floor is quite narrow as is many a bar in NYC. The selection is very good if you like brown liquor. I'm a vodka drinker so that was a bit less but they have the standards. The people coming in and out were 20 somethings and 30 somethings. The people who came and stayed were 40 somethings and up. Interesting selection of tunes. I'll be back!Soccer, Bud Light, & fantasy football...super popular things I simply don't get.  You can add the Dead Rabbit to that list.  The food, drinks, atmosphere, it's all good, but the prices (even for NYC) and how crowded it gets are huge negatives.  I suspect I will be back again and hope to have the same experience as others.  Maybe my expectations were simply too high.Good old bar. It has an old medieval feel to it. The Dead Rabbit has a few different sections. Each are unique but they're all charming. You can have an intimate chat or get rowdy. First floor you come to is the main bar. It has a great selection of beer. The Irish Red is the house selection. It's about $9 for a pint. Yes all the drinks are expensive, as they are at all the bars around this. Cocktails are about $18 each. That's more than a meal at most places. Also it's part of the reason why I haven't ordered any food. Another reason is because it's not exactly vegetarian friendly. They have a few salads but these are very pricey for some greens and tomatoes. I would come back to check out the other rooms here. The Parlor Room sounds particularly cool if you can get a reservation. You'll unfortunately be paying a lot more for the upstairs.Cane here for drinks on a Friday night and put our name  down immediately for the upstairs bar. The downstairs bar is like any other local bar but they had this Irish coffee that's warm and delicious especially in the winter. It's got like a cold foam on top but hot liquid on the bottom. I really enjoyed this hot drink and it was quite good. After about 45 minutes, the buzzer rang and we were able to go upstairs for a drink where it was more intimate and the cocktails were more unique. Shared 2 cocktailsPEACE PROCESS (HOT)SCOTCH WHISKY, JAMAICAN RUM, NUTMEG LIQUEUR, FERNET, WALNUT MILK, CHOCOLATESOUND AS A BELLIRISH WHISKEY, AMBER VERMOUTH, APPLE WINE, FIG LEAF, PASSIONFRUIT, CORN SILK TEA, BLACKSTRAP BITTERSOverall, the cocktails here are pricey but all well made. I particularly enjoyed all the hot drinks especially since it's winter time. Both cocktails I had were unique and the rest of the menu looks delicious as well. Come here if you're craving a unique cocktail.I had high hopes for this place as it was rated really well on one of those top bars in the world list. It was surprisingly empty when we went on a Saturday night, but I guess the FiDi crowd doesn't really go out at this time, and I get they closed awfully early for a bar (I think at like 2? With the late night menu starting pass midnight).The drinks were okay. My boyfriend got one of the lower level drinks and it tasted pretty light but was tasty as a smoothie (so-so as a cocktail). It had like Greek yogurt and coconut in it, and he liked it which was what matters.I got one of the higher level ones and it tasted a bit too much like Islay Scotch. It was too much that all you could taste was the peatiness and nothing else in the drink (in comparison to say a penicillin, where the peatiness just comes on the nose).Still had a great time there though and service was top notch. Our server refilled our waters on the clock!Great bar and super lively on a Saturday night! I stopped in around 8pm with a group of friends and luckily we were able to get a big table in the back on the first floor. It was super crowded and tightly packed but the table they gave us was like having our own private room! I only saw the first floor which had two rooms, a bar in each room. There is also an upstairs (which I heard is like a lounge) however when we went to check it out after dinner, the bouncer said it was too full. I ordered the vodka cocktail ($16) which was super refreshing. It tasted like a light cucumber summer cocktail; absolutely delicious! One of my friends got the Irish coffee ($14) which was also amazing. Not too strong; perfectly balanced! We ordered the deviled eggs with lobster ($15), truffle fries ($12) and the Guinness bread pudding dessert. The only thing I would not recommend was the bread pudding. It was very dry even with the ice cream on top. The menu was massive (see picture below), so you are bound to find something you enjoy!Our waitress was very patient and super friendly. She was able to split our check 4 ways and took a pic for the table. She recommended my cocktail drink and had the bartender make a custom mocktail for one of my friends (which she really enjoyed)! I will definitely be back here and would highly recommend this place!! Get here early to get a seat!Creative and interesting cocktail list that seems o frequently have new options, and great food (we especially love the stew).Ok the Irish coffee is 100% worth the hype. How do they make this magical drink? It's not at all bitter. In fact, it's dangerously smooth. That said it's not particularly strong or a large drink. But it's yuuuummmmy. The bar has an upstairs, but it was closed when we were there.We came at 10:30pm on a Wednesday and the bar was hopping. We found 2 seats at the bar. We left around 12:30, and the bar was packed. We didn't have any food, so I can't speak to that.I came here for a holiday party. The downstairs was extremely crowded, but luckily we had the third floor reserved. The space was cozy and intimate. I loved the Irish coffee cocktail. It's the perfect warm, boozy drink for winter and it's topped with a thick layer of sweet cream. Ask for it with nutmeg!The Dead Rabbit also provided catering for this party. The charcuterie spread provided a great selection of meats and cheeses. The lobster deviled eggs were meh. There wasn't enough lobster on them for me to be impressed. The short rib on the short rib sliders was very tender.Maybe not a great place if you're not into crowds, but perfect if you're looking to reserve a private room for a party! Service was friendly and attentive.Came in for drinks a couple times.  Solid cocktails and amazing Irish coffee.  Only thing we tried to eat was the devilled eggs with lobster, which was delicious.  Looked at what others were eating and everything looked good.  Will definitely be back to try some more foodGreat athmosphere and very good service.Such a cool place!

I'm not even a big beer drinker, but I liked all the different beers that I tried. They have a huge beer selection and delicious food. They even have a whiskey bar. I went over the weekend and they had brunch. It was back in April around Easter and they had a Cadbury Creme porter which was pretty good. I also tried a strawberry sour that was really refreshing. They have a lot of delicious pizzas. We had the burrata pizza and the margherita pizza. We also got the chicken and waffles, which is my go-to for brunch. The chicken was super crispy and the waffle was perfect. A friend joined us and ordered the rosemary fries which were really good as well. I also tried the matcha and blueberry beers which I enjoyed as well. I loved the variety of all the beer and the food and would definitely go back.Follow my food instagram @ms_new_foodie for all my foodie adventures.This place is awesome -- have been coming here for a few years, but has been a rock during the Covid era. I highly recommend the Burrata and the Shishito peppers for starters, he cheeseburger and chicken sandwich are phenomenal for the main course, especially if you are looking for something other than pizza (which are all great).I'm giving Circa Brewing five stars because the food, beer, service, and outdoor dining were all on point when I visited yesterday with three friends. We arrived around 3 and were seated outside right away. A few pumps of hand sanitizer, then we scanned the QR code for the menu. I'll start by describing the food. Pizzas are a focus, and we ordered a couple very different pies: the Heirloom, a white pie with tomato slices, and the Boys Got Heat, a spicy pepper pizza with hot sausage. The former is lighter and succulent, while the latter hit all the savory hot spots.We also ordered a 12-piece wings, half buffalo, half sweet tea brined. I wasn't all that crazy about the sweet tea wings, and the buffalo wings didn't blow me away either, though I did like the dipping sauce the wings came with. Our table also shared an order of rosemary french fries, a decent portion which we quickly devoured. I got to try a few of the beers, and they were all fresh and delicious. I liked the Special most of all, and the Golden Belgian was also enjoyable. I was a little surprised how good the beer was, since I hadn't heard of this brewery before. I'm happy to have made the discovery. Also have to give praise to the awesome wait staff. Our table was well taken care of, and we enjoyed the hospitality. The suggestion to end things with fried apple pie was a good call. To wrap things up, I'll just say that Circa satisfies, and I hope to eat more of their pizzas and drink more of their beers someday soon.Great service, great pizza and, of course, great beer! They have a good amount of outdoor seating available plus they just finished renovating inside which is perfect with the return of indoor dining! There is a beer for everyone on the menu, ranging from light to dark (kinda their motif). Can't go wrong with any of the pizzas either! I hope to be back!Out of the breweries I know of in NYC Circa is definitely up there in the top 5. This is because Circa checkmarks a lot of the best qualities a good brewery should have. It's spacious, has a great selection beer, and has great service. Additionally Circa also offers great food which even the best breweries I know of often don't offer. Unlike most breweries Circa has a lot of food and, in particular, brick oven pizza options. These are generally the biggest reason I come into Circa as they are delicious. They have a lot more variety of brick oven pizza options then I have seen in other places. You can the simple marinara/margherita options for example but you can also get pizzas with a lot of different toppings and cheese. The quality and size of all the pizzas though are satisfying. Circa however doesn't just stop at pizzas. I see they try to spice up the menu with exotic items every once in a while and it does catch my interest. I remember getting some Iberian ham here a few years ago... it was mad expensive but it was the first time I ever had high quality ham like that.Besides food the beers they brew are fantastic. I am not an IPA guy so I like they have a diverse, and delicious, non-IPA selection of beers. Each these beers are brewed to the strengths of the type of beer they are too. For example, one of my favorites is the Nutty Professor which has been a long time option on their beer menu. Its a brown ale which you can taste the roastyness of the beer without too much of the hops.I think of all the breweries I know of in NYC only 1 other place may beat it for biggest floor space. The place inside is just massive and includes a restaurant area, a bar area and during the hotter seasons a outdoor region. The feel of it is fairly industrial but not grimy industrial like Brooklyn Steel. There are lots of pipes, wooden floors and big fans on the ceiling. It feels like drinking WITHIN the sanitized space where they brew the beers.... which by the way you can see the giant brew tanks near the front.The restaurant region in particular is nice to sit at as it can be less crowded then the bar. You can also see the oven/kitchen where they make the pizzas while you wait. That is always a fun detail when eating out.I have known Circa for a few years and my opinion hasn't changed much. It's a fantastic place to eat and drink and I highly recommend it.Oh, Circa. You were my white whale for awhile. I came so close to coming to you several times, but alas, I feared our meeting would never occur (okay, maybe not never, but I wasn't sure just when). It wasn't until my not-so-big-on-beer-drinking buddy orchestrated a trip into Brooklyn that began right within Circa's walls that finally made it happen. Oh and I'm glad it happened because Circa is legit.So how does a guy who doesn't really enjoy beer too often end up suggesting a brewery? Well, he took his now-girlfriend there for one of their first dates so it has a little sentimentality for him. I mean I can see why you might be interested in choosing Circa as a date spot. The interior has some nice space to it with plenty of tables/seats and a beautiful bar that starts almost right when you walk in and wraps around a bit before ending right by the brewery silos. Besides the bar, those aforementioned seating choices involve waiter service, but between the bartenders and other staff, everyone seemed pretty chill with all orders being delivered with relative quickness.When I say orders, it's important to note that Circa is a brewery first and foremost, but they have a full bar along with a nice little menu of delicious-sounding food options...oh and pizza. Lots of pizza. Luckily for us, my buddy's girlfriend wanted to order one up and so we went for a pie that, now I look back on and I can't place it from the list of choices. Perhaps it had hot sopressata (even though it looked like pepperoni), but either way, the pizza was piping hot with just the right amount of cheese and a lovely char on the crust. We also got an order of fries which were crisp and tasty.I saved the best for last as Circa's beer is what should bring you back (though that pizza might too). Flights are available and so my buddy and I each got one to help range out our ability to taste almost everything. They have a great variety of styles which is always nice to see. What's nicer is to taste those differences. The Guava Sour had just the right amount of pucker-up power while their Tazzy IPA was hoppy with a little fruity kick. A few others were liked by my chums (they were big on the Vin Rogue Coco Porter which I thought was decent), but the most memorable would be their winter warmer beer 2nd Helpings. It had the perfect balance of maltiness and spices that had me dying to return for more.In fact, I did get to return to Circa recently with one of my friends, though our trip was cut short due to Circa closing early for a wedding. That didn't stop us from getting a pint each as per the super chill bartender. I went for a new brew instead of actually getting a 2nd helping of 2nd Helpings and tried their Peaches of Normandy which was a lovely IPA that perfectly balanced bitterness and peach flavor. That bartender and staff in general didn't chase us out either which was nice as we got to relax a bit until our pints were finished. This shortened-trip only adds to my desire to come back again...and maybe again!Overall, Circa has it all going for itself. A beautiful space, friendly staff, delicious food, and (most importantly) solidly memorable brews. I'm glad I can say I've finally been so I can check off that white whale as finally being captured. If you haven't been, consider it now your own pale-colored whale and get over there to experience Circa for yourself.My experience at Circa is a taleof highs and lows. Ultimately I liked the place and will definitely return. I enjoyed the beer and wings and I liked the decor though I felt it was too bright. The illumination feels more suited to a high school bio class than a brew pub. My experience started when I called Circa to make sure that they were still serving food on a Sunday night at 8:50 pm. I was told that they were serving for another 30-40 minutes. I arrived in an Uber 12 minutes later (checked the Uber app for confirmation). When we were seated and I ordered some of the wings I was told that they were only serving pizzas. I was shocked. This would have been excellent information to have 12 minutes earlier. I try to eat a low to no carb diet and was excited by several menu items (wings, salad, meat and cheese board) but alas none of that was available to me. I approached the bartender and inquired if he was the one to answer the phone. He said he was and I asked why he didn't inform me that they were not serving the full menu. He explained that he only got the word in the interim from when I had called and when I had arrived. I explained my dietary dilemma and he said that he was sorry and he would see if he could get me some wings for me. He said they would be on the house for my inconvenience. I was appreciative and thought this was well handled. The pizza that came to our table was quite good and the wings when delivered were also excellent. When the bill came however the wings were included. I paid for them. I didn't want to make a big deal about it but it added to the up and down experience. The menu says in big bright letters ""Dinner 5pm till close"" but that is clearly not the case. This should be indicated especially when someone calls on the phone to inquire about food. Overall the food and beer was solid so I won't ding them but one star for these issues.This place is everything in one - chill brewery for casual drinks, yummy restaurant for any meal, and great weekend hangout. I've been here a couple times for casual beers, but also decided to host a party here with friends. The process for reserving a larger space was very simple through yelp - I was able to easily request a date and time for a larger reservation. Since my party was about 15 people, there was no minimum to reserve a large space in the back. The person I was working with, Rachel, was super helpful in confirming the space and allowing me to order appetizers and pizzas ahead of the day. There also are several event packages you can choose from. Every pizza is incredible, especially the velvet underground, which has burrata, pesto, and hazelnuts! I love the rotating beers here, no matter what season it is, and can't wait till my next flight.Came here for dinner this evening and it was pretty packed around 6:30pm. Got a reservation easily and seated immediately.  I've been here before and remember the food being much better in spite of them being out of several things on the menu. We ordered the Margherita pizza, bucatini pasta and was a dessert pizza. All of the food was extremely bland and unflavored.  The pasta was especially lacking in taste in spite of the wild boar Raghu sauce. No spice, nothing.  The dessert pizza was a huge mistake.  Fried pizza dough with Nutella and something called boozy marscapone on top. The boozy marscapone tasted like blue cheese which was a terrible combination with Nutella.  I liked this place the first time I came, but nothing this time was good enough to return for.great pizza, salad was a little boring. great outdoor seating atmosphere too - and nicely warmed up with heater lampsThat was one amazing brunch! We got a coupon for brunch that included unlimited beer or cider for 2 hours! It was the first time for us, but definitely not the last. The place is quite big and divided into 3 different areas. You can buy some local merchandise. Our waiter was very attentive and polite!  He was constantly checking on how we doing.We ordered different pizzas for food and decided to try different types of beers and ciders. The pizza was a good size for a person, we shared and everything was delicious. I really liked the beer, that they make: from fruity to the stout ( which you feel is still ""young"", but not bad).We had so much fun hereGREAT spot. I took a date here a couple days ago and the service was excellent. We sat at the bar and ordered a couple drinks, followed by an order of chicken and waffles and one personal pizza. The bartender was kind, attentive, and energetic - exactly what you want in a bartender. Since it was my first time visiting, I asked him what his favorite menu options were, and he was very quick to make several recommendations, which my date and I both eventually ordered. The drinks selection was a very good size, and the menu was quite comprehensive as well. I would definitely come back to this place. It's great for a date spot or just to hang out with friends. Highly recommend!Fantastic Brewery in the heart of Brooklyn. It's also a pizzeria that serves lots of yummy food, so you can eat, drink, and be merry. I came here on a Sunday afternoon and it was fairly empty. There was no wait for a table and the servers were very attentive. I started off with an avocado toast (as pictured) that was yummy and filling. I also got some of the focaccia and jam. I'm not entirely convinced I was eating focaccia since the texture was a little different than what I was used to, but the jam was still very good.I wanted to a try a lot of different drinks, so I went with the tasting size of the Summer Ale which wasn't bad, but I didn't love it. I then tried the Nutty Professor and the Banana Pancakes Porter. The Porter was definitely my favorite drink that I tried. The flavor was great and it wasn't too hoppy. The Nutty professor wasn't anything super unique, so it didn't stand out that much to me. Definitely want to try out their pizza the next time I come here. It looked really tasty!We came here for a brunch the next day after an awesome New York wedding in August. We started out with a mimosa and Bloody Mary. (Mimosa was refreshing and needed for the recovery. Haha).I didn't get the chance to take a photo of the brunch table for the list of options that they were able to provide to us.  We had different pizzas served to our table and a brunch table that had french toast (and toppings) and the classic sausage, bacon, and egg breakfast.  All was honestly delicious and very filling!  In addition to the meals, we got to do a quick brewery tour by Drew.  He made it interesting and showed us his knowledge and passion for brewing this deliciousness! haha.  We also got to try some the wheat (? I think that's what it was... it's hard to remember after 2 months have pasted).  Anyways, it was a pretty good snack haha.  I didn't have room to drink any full glasses but I had a few sips here and there from my husband who tried out some of their beers.  Very good!  Overall, positive experience, friendly staff, and great knowledge on brewing (thanks Drew!).  A spot to check out in Brooklyn!Came here on a Friday evening.We got a table immediately. The decor at this restaurant was something new that I had not seen before. The style can be described as Urban. Pipes and beans scatter the roof and walls , while the tables are a made from nice solid wood- making the whole place pop.They have a huge selection of beers and ciders. The restaurant brews their own beers on the premise. I tried a rose cider which was perfect for a fall night. The cider was a mixture between grapes and a cider base. It was delicious! The pizza menu was also pretty extensive. I am vegetarian and I had plenty of options to order. I ordered the Marinara Pizza. The pizza was pretty big, came up to about 6 slices. The pizza was divine- hot and cheese. I would highly recommend this place for a great night out.I came here for a yelp event forever ago and had a great time so when it came up on Pulsd I knew I had to come back. They do a bottomless brunch with an entree + $25 for AYCD beer and select ciders. With the Pulsd deal it was $50 for 2 people. We ordered the Boys Got Heat (house-made spicy italian sausage, tomato, roasted pepper, fontina, mozzarello, parmigiano) and the Shroom (wild mushrooms, mozzarella, smoked idiazabal, farm egg). I liked the Shroom a ton, which is surprising because I'm not usually a big white pizza fan. The Boys Got Heat was great, but nothing too original. Both are around $21 on the regular menu and are a good, but not overwhelming, single portion. Crust is phenomenal, which everyone knows makes or breaks a pizza. As for the beers, I'm not sure how frequently they switch it up so unsure if this will be helpful. We tried a bunch (they do flights for bottomless! Amazing!!) and my personal favorites were the West Coast Red and the Double IPA. The Summer Ale was phenomenal - not my style beer, but gotta admit that it was great for what it was. Even ordered a second. Only mediocre beer was the Orange Pale Ale. Wasn't bad, just boring. Outdoor seating is great, inside also beautiful. Pristine bathroom. Great service. All in all, a really great brunch and I'm glad I came. Cheers!Great spot to relax and have beer. I went here for a brewery tour with City Brew Tours and I was very satisfied and happy with my experience. The place had this very chill vibe and they have a lot of great beer. I had samples of three kinds: Cherry Revision Wheat, Slim Pickings Session IPA, and Ph/DH Guava Sour. The IPA was really good. I like hoppy kinds but this one wasnt that hoppy and it had a smooth citrusy flavors. I never heard of this place before and it's in an area that you wouldn't expect it to be. It's in a busy neighborhood and you'd usually see breweries in Desolate, warehouse areas. They brew all their beers there and keep most of it in house so you wont really find them at a bar or supermarket.Came here for brunch on a sunny Sunday around noon.  When we initially walked in the place was on the quiet side but filled up as the afternoon progressed.  We are not beer connoisseurs but the waitress kindly made recommendations based on our taste for other drinks and she was spot on!  We started out with the Shaksbury Rose which was really great and something I look forward to buying as well as the Lovelythebeer Strawberry Sour which was also awesome!  To eat we had the gem lettuce salad, quiche, and burger.  The salad was very fresh and had a great dressing! The quiche was surprisingly light, which I appreciated since I usually steer clear of quiches because they tend to be heavy.  We topped off the meal with the flourless chocolate cake a la mode.  Overall, customer service was great and the space is really nice!  I also really appreciated how knowledgeable the staff was about their beverage offerings.I was so impressed with CircaThere was an elite event here, which I sadly missed (damn grad school, you'd better be worth it). Needless to say, when my friends suggested grabbing brunch here, I was all in, as I had heard great things. It did NOT disappoint. First of all, the feel this place puts out is fantastic. I love all the wood, the size, and location of the bar, the open-ish kitchen, and that huge fan. It only got better when our amazingly cool server came by. She explained all the beers they had running, and what the boozy brunch includes (two hours aycd tap beer, and a few canned ciders). Then she left us to it, not bugging for time or orders, just asking if we wanted more beer. Pretty much a dream brunch if you ask me, laid back, friendly, and no huge rush to get in and get out. When we did put in food, I was told to get a pizza, as they are amazing, but didn't listen and went for the burger instead. Rookie move. It's not that the burger is bad (not mind-blowing, but not bad), its that the pizza is that good. Seriously, the breakfast pie was awesome, thankfully my fiancee (who is much smarter than I) got it, so I could try it. Come here for brunch, bring your friends who have babies, and just chill for a few hours with the cool folks who run this place - you won't be disappointed.Food is good but expensive. Pizza is probably not worth it but I do like the honey pizza. Beer is what you come for and vibes. They have games, TVs and good atmosphere. Beer is really good and so is service.I went here last year pre-covid and enjoyed my experience here. I'm not even a big beer drinker, but I liked all the different beers that I tried. They have a huge beer selection and delicious food. They even have a whiskey bar. I went over the weekend and they had brunch. It was back in April around Easter and they had a Cadbury Creme porter which was pretty good. I also tried a strawberry sour that was really refreshing. They have a lot of delicious pizzas. We had the burrata pizza and the margherita pizza. We also got the chicken and waffles, which is my go-to for brunch. The chicken was super crispy and the waffle was perfect. A friend joined us and ordered the rosemary fries which were really good as well. I also tried the matcha and blueberry beers which I enjoyed as well. I loved the variety of all the beer and the food and would definitely go back.Follow my food instagram @ms_new_foodie for all my foodie adventures.This place is awesome -- have been coming here for a few years, but has been a rock during the Covid era. I highly recommend the Burrata and the Shishito peppers for starters, he cheeseburger and chicken sandwich are phenomenal for the main course, especially if you are looking for something other than pizza (which are all great).I'm giving Circa Brewing five stars because the food, beer, service, and outdoor dining were all on point when I visited yesterday with three friends. We arrived around 3 and were seated outside right away. A few pumps of hand sanitizer, then we scanned the QR code for the menu. I'll start by describing the food. Pizzas are a focus, and we ordered a couple very different pies: the Heirloom, a white pie with tomato slices, and the Boys Got Heat, a spicy pepper pizza with hot sausage. The former is lighter and succulent, while the latter hit all the savory hot spots.We also ordered a 12-piece wings, half buffalo, half sweet tea brined. I wasn't all that crazy about the sweet tea wings, and the buffalo wings didn't blow me away either, though I did like the dipping sauce the wings came with. Our table also shared an order of rosemary french fries, a decent portion which we quickly devoured. I got to try a few of the beers, and they were all fresh and delicious. I liked the Special most of all, and the Golden Belgian was also enjoyable. I was a little surprised how good the beer was, since I hadn't heard of this brewery before. I'm happy to have made the discovery. Also have to give praise to the awesome wait staff. Our table was well taken care of, and we enjoyed the hospitality. The suggestion to end things with fried apple pie was a good call. To wrap things up, I'll just say that Circa satisfies, and I hope to eat more of their pizzas and drink more of their beers someday soon.Great service, great pizza and, of course, great beer! They have a good amount of outdoor seating available plus they just finished renovating inside which is perfect with the return of indoor dining! There is a beer for everyone on the menu, ranging from light to dark (kinda their motif). Can't go wrong with any of the pizzas either! I hope to be back!Out of the breweries I know of in NYC Circa is definitely up there in the top 5. This is because Circa checkmarks a lot of the best qualities a good brewery should have. It's spacious, has a great selection beer, and has great service. Additionally Circa also offers great food which even the best breweries I know of often don't offer. Unlike most breweries Circa has a lot of food and, in particular, brick oven pizza options. These are generally the biggest reason I come into Circa as they are delicious. They have a lot more variety of brick oven pizza options then I have seen in other places. You can the simple marinara/margherita options for example but you can also get pizzas with a lot of different toppings and cheese. The quality and size of all the pizzas though are satisfying. Circa however doesn't just stop at pizzas. I see they try to spice up the menu with exotic items every once in a while and it does catch my interest. I remember getting some Iberian ham here a few years ago... it was mad expensive but it was the first time I ever had high quality ham like that.Besides food the beers they brew are fantastic. I am not an IPA guy so I like they have a diverse, and delicious, non-IPA selection of beers. Each these beers are brewed to the strengths of the type of beer they are too. For example, one of my favorites is the Nutty Professor which has been a long time option on their beer menu. Its a brown ale which you can taste the roastyness of the beer without too much of the hops.I think of all the breweries I know of in NYC only 1 other place may beat it for biggest floor space. The place inside is just massive and includes a restaurant area, a bar area and during the hotter seasons a outdoor region. The feel of it is fairly industrial but not grimy industrial like Brooklyn Steel. There are lots of pipes, wooden floors and big fans on the ceiling. It feels like drinking WITHIN the sanitized space where they brew the beers.... which by the way you can see the giant brew tanks near the front.The restaurant region in particular is nice to sit at as it can be less crowded then the bar. You can also see the oven/kitchen where they make the pizzas while you wait. That is always a fun detail when eating out.I have known Circa for a few years and my opinion hasn't changed much. It's a fantastic place to eat and drink and I highly recommend it.Oh, Circa. You were my white whale for awhile. I came so close to coming to you several times, but alas, I feared our meeting would never occur (okay, maybe not never, but I wasn't sure just when). It wasn't until my not-so-big-on-beer-drinking buddy orchestrated a trip into Brooklyn that began right within Circa's walls that finally made it happen. Oh and I'm glad it happened because Circa is legit.So how does a guy who doesn't really enjoy beer too often end up suggesting a brewery? Well, he took his now-girlfriend there for one of their first dates so it has a little sentimentality for him. I mean I can see why you might be interested in choosing Circa as a date spot. The interior has some nice space to it with plenty of tables/seats and a beautiful bar that starts almost right when you walk in and wraps around a bit before ending right by the brewery silos. Besides the bar, those aforementioned seating choices involve waiter service, but between the bartenders and other staff, everyone seemed pretty chill with all orders being delivered with relative quickness.When I say orders, it's important to note that Circa is a brewery first and foremost, but they have a full bar along with a nice little menu of delicious-sounding food options...oh and pizza. Lots of pizza. Luckily for us, my buddy's girlfriend wanted to order one up and so we went for a pie that, now I look back on and I can't place it from the list of choices. Perhaps it had hot sopressata (even though it looked like pepperoni), but either way, the pizza was piping hot with just the right amount of cheese and a lovely char on the crust. We also got an order of fries which were crisp and tasty.I saved the best for last as Circa's beer is what should bring you back (though that pizza might too). Flights are available and so my buddy and I each got one to help range out our ability to taste almost everything. They have a great variety of styles which is always nice to see. What's nicer is to taste those differences. The Guava Sour had just the right amount of pucker-up power while their Tazzy IPA was hoppy with a little fruity kick. A few others were liked by my chums (they were big on the Vin Rogue Coco Porter which I thought was decent), but the most memorable would be their winter warmer beer 2nd Helpings. It had the perfect balance of maltiness and spices that had me dying to return for more.In fact, I did get to return to Circa recently with one of my friends, though our trip was cut short due to Circa closing early for a wedding. That didn't stop us from getting a pint each as per the super chill bartender. I went for a new brew instead of actually getting a 2nd helping of 2nd Helpings and tried their Peaches of Normandy which was a lovely IPA that perfectly balanced bitterness and peach flavor. That bartender and staff in general didn't chase us out either which was nice as we got to relax a bit until our pints were finished. This shortened-trip only adds to my desire to come back again...and maybe again!Overall, Circa has it all going for itself. A beautiful space, friendly staff, delicious food, and (most importantly) solidly memorable brews. I'm glad I can say I've finally been so I can check off that white whale as finally being captured. If you haven't been, consider it now your own pale-colored whale and get over there to experience Circa for yourself.My experience at Circa is a taleof highs and lows.

When we did put in food, I was told to get a pizza, as they are amazing, but didn't listen and went for the burger instead. Rookie move. It's not that the burger is bad (not mind-blowing, but not bad), its that the pizza is that good. Seriously, the breakfast pie was awesome, thankfully my fiancee (who is much smarter than I) got it, so I could try it. Come here for brunch, bring your friends who have babies, and just chill for a few hours with the cool folks who run this place - you won't be disappointed.Food is good but expensive. Pizza is probably not worth it but I do like the honey pizza. Beer is what you come for and vibes. They have games, TVs and good atmosphere. Beer is really good and so is service."

Staff is very friendly and helpful and service is fast. Upon entry there is an elevator that leads you to your theater. As you head up, there are comic-like pictures on the walls that gives the cinema its vintage feel. There are lights underneath your table to help you read the menu. Chairs are cozy! There isn't usually a line, but you can get your tickets online and just breeze right in.This was my first visit to Alamo Cinema and I'm mad at myself for not enjoying here sooner. I took an Uber to the cinema and was a little lost but once I entered the building there were signs directing you to the top level for the theatre. My date was on time and was just as shocked at the gem - Alamo Cinema. I bought the tickets online and chose our seats. So we were not stopped when we started our way up the escalator. We came to see Queen and Slim. When we entered the theatre there were three ppl at the door showing you to your seats and where to locate the menus.  yes ! We ordered simple drinks; I had a frozen margarita and chicken with fries. The order came while the movies was showing but it wasn't an interruption since they took the credit card to start a tab. The server came back to ask if we would like fresh popcorn - oh hell yeah! Thank you Alamo You've made me an official fan. Next trip will be with my kids.My friend and I really wanted to see a movie in the city and there are so many choices.  Many of which have absurd prices and should be shut down (looking at you regal union square lol). So we found this place online and she told me it was probably like the one in Yonkers near her and i would did it.  She was totally right. So it's quite possible that this is a 4 star instead of a 5 star because Ik spoils by going to Movie Tavern in Syracuse. So the main issue I have here are the seats are just not that comfortable at all and are extremely aged. MT has full reclining seats and adjustable tables while having a stadium seating effect too.  So without all of those accommodations I can't give this place a 5.  The food is also the most expensive food I've ever seen at a dine in movie place. It's sad because it they were just 3-4$ cheaper I would have tried the food and I'm sure that there are many others like me.  Being successful is about pricing appropriately.  The staff are also kinda short tempered. So that was a ton of complaints I know, but it really is a fun time. The screen is decent, they serve blue sky soda which is a huge perk, and the movie ticket price is very fair. This is also in a good area In brookyln so you will feel safe too. I recommend coming here next time you want to see a movie.  I would recommend going to eat before coming though.The concept of having a meal and watching a movie is harmonious. Alamo isn't the only game in town but it is one of Brooklyn's original. Beyond having the luxury of a served meal at your seat you also book tickets (and seats) in advance. I can't go to the movies any other way. Long gone are the days of getting there 30+ minutes early to get the right seats for you and your family. Now you do this in the app or online and roll in just as it's about to begin (you can even arrive a little late if you don't mind missing the trailers and funny ""don't text here"" announcements). The food is high quality and there's brunch and lunch options. There's also some yummy cocktails you can order. I'm partial to the bloody Mary's and the dark chocolate shake with vodka or tequila - amazing! I've always dug the vintage vibe they have here with retro posters and speakeasy style bar you can hit Pre-show. The only thing holding them back from a top 5 stars is that over the times I've been there they are hit or miss with service. We've ordered things that haven't arrived and it's a little difficult to flag them down during the movie (even with the system of leaving your card up to attract their attention). Things happen, but they weren't apologetic about it nor did they provide any compensation. Lastly, and good to know for families, they didn't want our 4 kids (all 5-8) sitting in the row in front of the adults. They claimed it was some policy which annoyed me and was BS. Other than that, it's a solid place to catch a flick.We decided to check this place out. It's been open for some time but we never got around to go. Parking was a hassle. However, the trip was totally worth it. It was a really nice experience. We ate at the DeKalb Market so didn't get a chance to eat here. They do have a pretty decent food and drink menu. The seats did not recline which was kind of a bummer. Service was great.Prices were reasonable. It was nice and quiet during the movie, which it always should be, however not always the case. They have a bar that you can hang out until the movie begins. Make sure to be there on time or they willnot let you in. I recommend purchasing tickets in advance. Overall, we enjoyed ourselves.I moved to NYC from Austin so was so excited when a Drafthouse opened! I hadn't seen a movie at a non-Drafthouse in over 10 years for a reason. Love the pre-show clips, the service, and the giant bowls of popcorn. Besides my own home, I hate to see a movie anywhere else!Love this place.  The fact that they are really serious about people not texting and talking during the show is good enough for me, but the fact that you can get food and drink (including booze!) in a comfortable seat makes this an excellent movie-going experience.I've been here twice and enjoyed it both times.  The beer list is really good with an extensive selection of NY State drafts.  Craft cocktails are tasty too.   The food is hit and miss.   My chips and queso was ""meh"" and my pepperoni pizza was good but way too greasy.Service has always been great.   I have to say, I'm a fan.I have always wanted to try those bistro and movie type places and I finally found my go-to movie spot. Although it is in Brooklyn, it is easy to access if you live in Uptown Manhattan. The train stop takes you directly to the mall/movie theatre building. The place is really spacious and clean and the customer service is by far the best I have seen so far! The first time we went here, we had a mix up with our tickets/movie theatre and they accommodated us at the bar and provided us free movie tickets for our next visit and got food at the bar complimentary! They really did the right thing by securing a loyal customer by turning our initial experience around. I had the pretzel and queso and chips from the menu and it was so good. The food is high quality and the seats are spacious and comfortable. Kudos to the manager that night for turning our evening around and for accommodating us despite the mix up! If you come early or want to hang out after the movie, there is a bar on the first floor that you can hang in. They have loud music so not really a place to converse. You can also check out the Dekalb market with all the foodie spots if you want something else. The second time I went, I had the popcorn, a fruity beverage, and the queso and chips again as I crave that spicey queso dip from time to time! I will be a frequent movie-goer to this location because of the location, the service, and the experience. I highly recommend going to this place!Came for an 11:15pm showing on a Friday night with a group of 8. Large theater with drink/food option delivered right to seat. Tickets checked at seat which was different and also nice. Ordered a margarita on the rocks which was not good. Had the largest and most buttery bowl of popcorn I've ever had. They have a crazy strict no talking policy that borders on absurd.Movie experience itself was fine.. good volume, lights etc. price is steep and the food/drinks aren't cheap either. It's easily a 100$ excursion. I don't come to the movies often so can't say this experience convinced me to change my way.It's a really good cinema. It's more expensive than other cinemas. 1. The cinema have waiters walk through to take your orders. Food orders are written on cards and left on the table. My server took a long time to get my card and when I tried getting another server to help he ignored me.The seats are roomy and comfortableI came here to watch a movie on a Sunday morning.  The theater is actually on the 4th floor in the City Point Shopping Center.  You have to write on the ordering card what you want and then stand the card up in the railing.  The tables on the seats were large but you can't move them. I ordered the breakfast flatbread pizza ($14).  The portion was larger than I expected.  The pizza was delicious and crispy.  The food was pretty good.  The food was better than other eat-in movie theaters like CMX Cinebistro, iPic, AMC Dine-In, etc.  The service was pretty good too, there was always a server who saw the card up.  The only thing I didn't like was that the theater wasn't dark enough.  I guess it's for safety reasons since the servers have to look for the ordering cards and deliver food.  I did appreciate the lights under the tables though.  FYI - if you're a Victory rewards member, you get a free movie ticket on your birthday.If a new movie is out, I pray they're showing it. Always an enjoyable experience. The waiters/food prep could be a little quicker but I get it, it's usually a packed theater.The Parmesan truffle popcorn deserves 5 stars alone.This is such a great theater!My husband and I have been coming here more and more for date night since I'm heavily pregnant and more active activities just aren't on the table right now (ie museums etc). We've been able to see so many interesting independent films, animes (yes, we're dorks), and regularly playing ""Hollywood"" movies as well. This Friday we're seeing E.T. and the week after we're catching a 1970s Kung fu flick. For me, it's great since Netflix is so prolific it's nice to see something different or special in some way. Not to mention they serve all kinds of theater treats and snacks, meals, drinks and (for those who aren't imbibing at the moment) really tasty milkshakes : ). The staff is always great, too - polite, helpful, and willing to shush the odd talkative or giggly table. I'm so glad I live right next to this place. I even heard that they play ""family movies"", which is just regular movies an adult might want to see but not as loud so ppl bring their babies and don't have to worry about getting childcare or being embarrassed if they cry or whatever. This place kind of has/does everything if you're a cinephile.Definitely download their app so you can keep up with their screenings and book in advance because tickets often sell fast. (But don't worry, you can get a refund or rain check if something comes up, how great is that ?!)I. LOVE. THE. ALAMO. DRAFTHOUSE This place can get all my money! One of the many things that I love about the Alamo Drafthouse is the reserved seating--I want to know that I don't have to get there super early in order to get a seat. It's actually recommended to reserve your seat because oftentimes than not, they sellout of seats. Another thing that I like is dine-in feature. I've ordered several dishes from AD but I love the avocado toast. The chips and queso was good as was chili cheese hotdog. The flatbread was nothing memorable. I highly recommend the key lime pie milkshake (with or without rum). AD is extremely strict about not using cellphones and talking loudly. They will kick you out--I mean, you spend almost $20 on the movie and then spend money on food, why waste time with the phone in your face? More importantly, why distract me with the lit screen from your phone?! Anyway, you try it, they'll warn you, you try it again, they kick you out. I love it! Also, you got to get there before the last preview is shown--they don't allow late entrants. I'm so spoiled that I really don't want to go another theater.We have been coming here at least once a month over the last couple of years and we like it. The concept is very attractive though its not new any more. Some don't like having food along with a movie - the servers may be distracting, the sound of people eating whole meals may be annoying. But for me and my wife this is about as comfortable as it gets. We get to have a full meal and get a movie out the way while we watch. We are not connoisseurs of movies to such a degree that we can't stand the slight interruptions. Their truffle popcorn is especially good. And so is almost everything on the menu. One gripe is they give ketchup in an open small paper cup. And this is prone to being spilled - as evidenced by my stained shoes from a couple of months back. But that is likely more because I am clumsy and not representative of what others experience. Shoutout to the creative 'turn off your phones' messages at the start of movies.Love the concept of being able to enjoy a meal and a movie at the same time. Tickets are about $17.50/pp. meals/apps range between $8-$25. I got the bbq wings (6wings) and my friend got the hotdog which came with fries. They were both good ! The prices are a bit much but i mean ... for the experience, what do ya expect? Drinks / Beer also offered. I do think the seats area a bit small so it may be something to consider. Overall, a cool date night or chill experience. Must. Go.Today I visited this theatre for the first time and  I truly enjoyed the experience. I ordered my tickets online , and I made sure to pick seats that were connected by a little gray line online so that I would be sitting next to my date instead of a stranger. After purchasing my ticket I went to the theater where I was only asked for my ticket when my waiter came to take my order. The lobby is full of books , action figures , toys and a plethora of books. One book that caught my interest was the history of various depictions of Black theatre art. Asides from the interesting literature the movie theatre follows a system . Patrons aren't allowed upstairs until an hour before the movie starts . Once it's time to for your movie of choice to start then you are allowed upstairs. There are many theaters on the second floor. I think eight theaters to be exact . I had the pleasure of watching a movie in theatre four which was spacious comfortable and had a large amount of space for leg room . The menu at this theatre is extensive and well priced . I ordered popcorn , the trick or treat cookies , barbecue wings and a root beer float which all came up to 45 dollars including tax. The food was great! The movie and surround system was great. The bathrooms were clean and very well designed . All of the staff members were very kind and accommodating ! I had a great experience at this theatre and I will definitely return . PS there are bathrooms on both floors and in order to order food you must write your order on an index card with the pen connected to the table and place it in an area that is visible to your waiter.I was eager to check out this dine in theater after hearing about it for a while now! It's upstairs in a shopping center so if you need to wait for a film you can check out target, etc. before or after while you're there. My friend and I decided to hang out at the bar inside the venue. They have a happy hour every day which is great! And you can even take your drinks with you into the theater. They have some crazy wax figures, some of which are pretty graphic!The theater has assigned seating so make sure to book in advance or get there early to get a good seat. Even the last row still has a good view since it's really not that far back. The seats are very comfy and there are small tables between each set of seats where you can look at the menu and place orders. The staff come by and pick up your written order and then bring it out to you during the film. You can keep ordering during the movie as well. I found the prices a bit high but sharing something is a great deal. We went with the grilled cheese that comes with fries and it was good! Pretty decent portions.I would definitely come back here since it's very easy to get to. Right off the Q train at Dekalb.My wife and I really enjoyed our date night here. We enjoyed the food, drink and service provided. The wings were delicious, sweet Thai chili. Right amount of sauce and loved the char crunch on them. Our drinks were excellent, loved the many selections available. And their popcorn beats any other movie theater, evenly distributed butter and not greasy. Sound system was great. What my wife and I really liked was the very strict rules they enforce regarding talking, texting and cellphones. They will boot you out, no refunds! Kudos because we really enjoyed the movie without any jabbering in the theatre. Little on the pricey side but well worth it. Because of the strict rules, I don't recommend bringing very young kids here. Try it out, you'll enjoy yourselves. We sure did.I LOVE this! I wish they had this upstate. A movie theater with table service! You can order food and drinks, the alcohol kind, and enjoy a movie while enjoying your lunch. The food was good. I ordered the popcorn with clarified butter. It was a nice sized bowl too so I shared some. I don't normally share my popcorn either. I also ordered the blackened chicken Cesar salad. Nice sized bowl chock full of Ceaser salad ingredients and chicken. Paired with a nice cold Pilsner (all local beers on the menu!), it was perfect. The service was quick, accurate and impressive! You fill out a card and pop it in a slot and they come by and take it and bam! Your food appears within 10 minutes.I'm sure we in upstate will catch on to this fun way of going to the movies!! Hurry up already."

Forgot how good the drinks were here. They had a nice layout outside. Shout out to our waiter last night (Jelani) for dealing with our large group. He pointed us to all the good stuff and kept us aware of the time.We came in 5mn before the kitchen closes and managed to order their crispy Brussel Sprouts (Amazing!)For drinks, I started out with their namesake the Clover Club. All ingredients that I love : Gin, dry vermouth, raspberry, lemon and egg white. I could sip on that every night. My friend enjoyed the Mediterranean Mule (Grey goose vodka, Montenegro, strawberry, ginger, lemon, soda). Lovely tall drink! I moved on to the Clever Girl (Old Tom Gin, lemon, raspberry, blackberry, vanilla, prosecco). I found it to be a refreshing and festive cocktail. For the rest of our group, the bartender improvised and made a Kentucky Derby with whiskey, raspberry, lemon & soda. It came out strong and super well balanced.Really love the fact that you can taste the quality in every sip of their drinks, plus the food is awesome!Came for brunch at around 1 pm on a Sunday and there was no wait for a table for two outdoors. My boyfriend and I shared the duck hashbrown and fried chicken waffle. I also had a frozen pina colada, which was perfect. Out of the dishes, the waffle was my favorite. Homemade chips were amazing. Next time: I want to try the deviled eggs and more cocktails!This review is so simple to write. Nothing complicated. I just think $15 for a drink with less than a shot of alcohol is absurd. I was so excited to try this place. Yesterday I ordered one of their hot drinks. I'm 5'2, a lightweight, and can easily get tipsy from a glass of wine. I did not feel the alcohol in the drink one bit- just sugar water. Will not be going back as there are too many great bars in the area.  Not that I order drinks to get buzzed, I could have just gotten a tea for $3 somewhere else had I known. (insert emoji shrugging shoulders here).Got delivery from here tonight. Looks like they still have some kinks to work out on the delivery menu/offerings, but it was ...okay. Portions were small- I normally have a very small appetite, but had no problem polishing off their steak frites ($25) and crisps ($8) by myself. Crisps were amazing, the standout of the night. Fries were good and homemade- albeit all fries suffer from delivery. (Photos of both chips and fries taken before any were eaten.) Steak was a great cut, but absolutely abolished by the amount of black pepper on it. Like it made my nose run. I didn't envy my mom and friend's eating situations with their burgers- these were multiple napkin affairs, and my friend gave up after her bun dissolved. Was hoping this would be a place I'd want to head to in person after this mess, but it looks like it's one I may be crossing off the list instead. $100+ tab for 3 with no drinks/desserts, I think my expectations were a bit higher.From what I've read, Clover Club is considered by many to be one of the best cocktail bars in Brooklyn. This past weekend, I also learned it's a fine spot for brunch. And I'm not just saying that because they serve duck hash... okay, maybe I am. That cozy atmosphere extends to brunch as well, as does their list of interesting brunch cocktails, combined with some boozy coffees which made a first drink choice more difficult than I expected. I eventually went with something called an Afternoon Buzz, which was probably a foreshadowing of the rest of my day and evening.The food came out really quickly. The duck hash was not chunks of meat and potato as I might have expected, but more like a giant patty almost the size of the plate, topped with a fried egg and two spicy sauces (I think a sriracha and an aioli) with the colors looking deceptively like they had added strips of bacon on top (such a tease). But a thumbs up on the pancakes, some of the best ones I've had at a restaurant in a long time.While I agree that some spiciness is goodness, that doesn't mean extra spiciness is better. I could have done with a bit less of the sauces to let the flavor of the hash speak for itself (meaning I had to scrape a bit off). My dining companion, who does enjoy her Bloody Mary a bit peppery, also commented that she felt her drink was too peppery. It was great to dine here, and now I'm looking forward to a return visit some evening for more.My partner and I stopped by here the other night because it was cold out and they have hot cocktails on the menu. By the end, we had tried every hot cocktail there was, and they were all delicious. I can't remember their names, but the one with Mezcal was my favorite. We also ordered a steak appetizer and crab dip - so so good! We're looking forward to coming back and having a proper dinner.Beautiful atmosphere, highly recommend for date night/first date. It a big bar yet intimate and quaint with candles on all the tables. They have a very reasonable happy hour that I took full advantage of. This place is elevated bar food, I loved the chips with tangy creme dip. I would discrediting humanity if I don't address their breading pudding. It is ridiculously good. It has a subtle sweetness. Honestly could eat this everyday for a year and be happy. Make room for it!Ooh, I have been here twice in the last few months and have enjoyed myself each time!Loves:+ The drinks. Everything is good. Their booklet is also the cutest drink booklet ever as there are caricatures of the staff inside!+ Food is good. Some of my faves include: mac & cheese ($15), fried chicken ($20), spinach & artichoke dip ($11), and crispy brussel sprouts ($13).+ Their sister restaurant is Leyenda but let me tell you, it feels like 10x easier to hear people in this place.Not so love:- The seats near the door, lol. I wore my winter coat throughout dinner because I was still that cold.Even though this awesome place is in my hood I cannot visit her all the time because I don't always feel like paying $50 for dinner, but when I do feel like having a #treatyoself moment, I know Clover Club is here to help this girl out! :)Fancy drinks with specialty cocktailsOrdered the coconutree holy grailThis place has a Really nice vibeOrdered some food to try The grilled octopus was not that greattoo much beans and not enough octopus to ate Those hot chicken sliders were spicyFelt like it's missing some fries since it's pricey Overall this place is classySo dress nice and be glassyI did an event at Books Are Magic last month and more than one person suggested getting drinks at Clover Club before heading over to the bookstore. I go to a lot of readings and really appreciate a good bar within a short walk of a bookstore. These bars are not only great default hangouts for reading-adjacent events, but they tend to be in fun, walkable areas, and appeal to the exact yipster nerds who voluntarily spend their evenings listening to authors talk about books.We met up at Clover Club at around 5:30 on a rainy Thursday and were able to get a table for five with ease. The place never felt empty, but it stayed pretty calm the whole time we were there. I liked the dim, speakeasyish ambiance and decor--a set-up I've definitely seen before, but one that I tend to enjoy. Service was decent, though I might have ordered a second drink if our waiter had checked on us a little more often.I'm pregnant, so I wasn't really drinking in any case. The cocktails all looked delicious and I watched with envy as my friends drank them. I was happy to find a selection of zero-proof cocktails, at least, and ordered the Before Sunset, a refreshing, sweet and spicy drink with ginger, pineapple, lemon, lime, and jalapeño.Clover Club also has food, so we shared a few snacks, and I got some sliders for an easy dinner. We got the salty and sweet spiced nuts, the deviled eggs, and the spinach artichoke dip for the table. I liked the deviled eggs--there was an assortment of them with different things on top, and I'm not sure which ones I ate, but they were tasty. The spinach artichoke dip was great, served with house tortilla chips. I didn't try the nuts, but I assume they were fine. The hot chicken sliders were solid, with buttermilk and cayenne-marinated chicken finished with herb aioli and house hot sauce.I had a swell time at Clover Club and will probably come back any time I visit Books Are Magic. It's a comfortable bar with nice atmosphere and lots to drink and snack on. Hopefully next time, I'll be able to drink the actual cocktails.Stands the test of time! I'm cringing a little at the review I wrote in my 20s (I was a food critic, apparently), but I'm glad to say that I've never stopped coming to this amazing place!In all the years I've visited, I'm quite sure I've never had a bad drink. My companion, a cocktail fanatic, is totally gaga for this place, it's like a kid in candy store. Always a treat.They got a new food menu somewhat recently and it's excellent! Just the perfect place to go, all around. The staff are so professional, the ambience is so cozy, especially in the winter. What's not to love??Never change, Clover Club!!I came here on Sunday night for dinner and it wasn't busy. The place was very dark and we sat by the window. It's good for dates or large groups. We ordered several cocktails and plates to share. Prices were average. Service needs improvement. Oysters - Overpriced, tiny and very briny. I wouldn't recommend. Spicy PEI Mussels - Delicious. It's not actually spicy in my opinion. The wine broth was so buttery and great for dipping. Don't be afraid to ask for more bread! Crisps with duck fat and truffle creme -Soooo addictive but extremely heavy and greasy. The flavors of duck and fat and truffle were strong and worked very well together. Cocktails - Very good and nicely crafted. My favorite of course was the Clover Club.I came here for a quick drink while waiting for a table at the sister bar across the street. Come here and not there.Their drinks were inventive and great. I thoroughly enjoyed my drinks to the point where I almost missed my table at the other bar as I was taking a long time to savor them. We ordered a quick appetizer of artichoke dip that honestly came with maybe 10 chips. Odd how restaurants think it's normal to eat dip like a soup considering you run out of chips with the first half of the bowl. We asked for more chips and were not told there would be a fee. They sorted it out but it's odd to not let us know about that.  However, the service was great. The host was so nice and accommodating. The space itself has that hipster vibe to it, bar with tiled and wooden accents and speckled with antique-looking functional furniture. Definitely coming back for that matcha cocktail.This place is all around, fantastic! From the service, to the food, to the drinks -- so good. We tried a few things on the menu and all of them were delicious, so anything you choose, you won't go wrong. The mixologist makes great cocktails. The waitress we had was SO kind and delightful! Really just do yourself a favor and go! Can't wait to go back soon. This is definitely a place I would like to go to at least once a month.*Drink review only*Some of the best cocktails you might possibly ever drink can be experienced at Clover Club.I've visited Clover Club several times in the nearly 11 years since it has made Smith Street its home.The décor is very inviting and sexy with a speakeasy feeling allowing it to stand out among other businesses along Smith street. Perfect for a date or hanging with friends.I'm sure I tried some bites when I visited in the past but my memory doesn't serve me well since it has been a while. As such, this review will focus on my recent visit whereupon I enjoyed their incredible cocktails.Although we sat at the bar, there were plenty of tables (albeit occupied) and I think a back space through velvet curtains. Considering it was a Saturday evening, it was super crowded and the place where everyone wanted to be.Because I arrived first, i was able to get acquainted with our bartender of the evening, Ryan, who carefully crafted and curated some of the most visually appealing cocktails (and mocktails) at record speed.It was actually enjoyable sitting at the bar since it was adorned with all the necessary cocktail essentials--variety of bitters, beakers containing an assortment of mixers and a gorgeous herb and fruit/garnish display. Note, Clover Club is fully stocked to include an assortment of whiskeys, gin and vodka according to brand but for those who are beer/wine lovers, they've got you covered.Their cocktail menu was thoughtfully mapped out per category such as Sour drinks, Tiki style drinks, Gin and more.My head spun. That's when I closed the menu and allowed Ryan to decide for me. He was spot on after I told him my preferences--- I started out with the Green Giant drink.  Too pretty to drink, the Green Giant was a combination of Old tom gin, sugar snap peas, tarragon, lemon, dry vermouth. This had the wow factor, served over crushed ice and very refreshing. I typically do not drink Gin but this was a mellow variety and I felt it was necessary to keep the integrity of the drink intact rather than substitute vodka for gin.My next drink was the Sun kissed Sour. Since I was seeking something different sans crushed ice, Ryan suggested this drink especially after I emphasized my fondness for spicy drinks. This was Chili-pepper infused blanco tequila, watermelon, lime, blanc vermouth, pink peppercorn. Between the two cocktails, this might have been my favorite. It was extremely delicious and definitely had that spicy kick to it. My final drink, Gypsy Rose,  was actually a mocktail. As the menu mentioned, at zero proof, it was a combination of Elderflower, strawberry, grapefruit, lime, soda. I'm a huge fan of Elderflower, both the liquor and non alcohol variety. Very smooth and delicious.Some of the other drinks served to us were the Tokyo Drift which was a whiskey cocktail, an Old Fashioned made with Bourbon and a straight single malt whiskey. No complaints with these.As we enjoyed our drinks, the incredible aroma of food, which was brought to tables and those at the bar, looked quite good.Four hours and $120 later, we left satisfied, satiated and imbibed delicious cocktails at Clover Club.Elegant, super chill, wonderful drinks/food make Clover Club a must visit establishment.Absolute winner.I came here for brunch on a cold, rainy day. Seating was quick and quarters were tight. The service was fast and, if not friendly, helpful and quick. The food was pretty good although their selection was mostly limited to egg dishes. I had the eggs and gravy dish because they were basically out of everything else I wanted and it was pretty good. I would recommend this place and I would come back but I wasn't totally wowed or anything.My hubby and I threw a baby shower in the beautiful private Parlor Room in the back of the Clover Club and we had a very good experience.Pros:- Beautiful, elegant, and tasteful space with 1800's decor and furnishings. We didn't want to just rent a regular office space and this venue really stood out- No hourly/day space rental fee!- Attentive and friendly staff. We worked with General Manager Justin and Susan with all logistics and they were always responsive. Our bartender Ashley was super outgoing and friendly and my guests all really liked her. - We ordered Deviled Eggs, Cheese Board, Cured Meats, Pulled Pork Minis, Caprese Crostini, Stuffed Mushrooms. All the food was fresh, flavorful and came out in a timely manner. Our friends raved about the Pulled Pork Minis and Caprese Crostini. - Wide variety of fun and delicious cocktails and mocktails. Cons:- The minimum gratuity starts the time your party starts. So if you wanted to order a round of drinks for your friends who helped set up earlier in the morning, that would not count towards the minimum. Our bartender was sweet enough to allow an exception and set it up once she got the bar ready - If anyone wanted to order additional dishes from the regular menu, you have to move out of the Parlor Room and dine in the front dining area, which is frustrating because you don't want to leave the party Details for Parlor Room (Sun-Thurs/Sat Afternoons)- 45 people max capacity for private parties. - The requirement is $300 guaranteed minimum gratuity on all beverages. This means a total bar spend of $1500 assuming guests tip 20%. Drinks can be rung as a cash bar (each guest pays for their own drinks) or open bar (host to pay the entire tab.) At the end of the party, the host must guarantee that the minimum gratuity on all beverages reaches $300 or that the difference is met from cash bar tips. All drinks are rung based on consumption.- Food orders, and signed food contracts are due one week in advance of party. Please note that food is subject to 20% service charge, which does not apply toward the gratuity minimum on beverages.- Saturday & Sunday afternoon events must be cleared by 6pm. You can get there as early as 10:30am to setup. - You cannot use anything that punctures any surface, also no glitter, confetti, stickers, and no duct tape (or equivalent) on any finished wood.- Tall ladder is supplied but not tall enough to reach the ceiling. Tall enough to reach high up on the walls though.- Must supply the source and speakers if you want to play your own music at a reasonable volume.- $25 cake cutting fee covers two small-to-medium-sized cakes or one really big cake. There is no fee for desserts like cupcakes and cookies, and they are happy to arrange them on one of their platters.Food Details- Recommend ordering 2-3 platters of stationary hors d'ouevres, plus the following amount(s) of passed hors d'ouevres. - 4-5 pieces of passed hors d' oeuvres per person is considered light eating. 6-7 pieces per person is considered medium eating. 8-10 pieces per person are considered heavy eating, or enough for each of your guests to call a full meal.   Finally, we ended up spending $1096 for food (medium eating), $115 on bar gratuity difference (in addition to $175 for drinks to treat our friends who helped out). Everything came together, everyone had a grand, well-fed, and drunk time and I highly recommend Clover Club for private parties! Thank you Justin, Susan, Ashley, and staff for helping us host a wonderful and memorable baby shower!I was highly disappointed in this place after seeing the great reviews. I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the bacon tasting (really tasty), huervos rancheros (average at best), egg sandwhich (very tasty) and the criossant french toast (very disappointing. had some type of lemon batter. not your typical french toast that you expect).The service was awful. Our waitress was incredible rude the entire time. We were sat with no silverware, brushed off when we asked for milk and sugar for our coffee, and very inattentive. Every time we spoke to her it felt like we were inconveniencing her from her job. Highly disappointing and not a great experience.Stumbled upon the Clover Club around brunch after visiting the amazing bookstore, Books Are Magic.Clover Club's baked eggs were amazing and reasonably priced at $13. The toast was very fresh and great for dipping in the baked eggs.The portion looks small via the photo, but it was a lot more filling than expected. Service was great and very efficient. If I'm in the area I would stop by for brunch again.Nice brunch today. My wife and I both enjoyed our omelettes and our friends also enjoyed their food. Friendly service.Haven't frequented this bar in a while. Forgot how good the drinks were here. They had a nice layout outside. Shout out to our waiter last night (Jelani) for dealing with our large group. He pointed us to all the good stuff and kept us aware of the time.We came in 5mn before the kitchen closes and managed to order their crispy Brussel Sprouts (Amazing!)For drinks, I started out with their namesake the Clover Club. All ingredients that I love : Gin, dry vermouth, raspberry, lemon and egg white. I could sip on that every night. My friend enjoyed the Mediterranean Mule (Grey goose vodka, Montenegro, strawberry, ginger, lemon, soda). Lovely tall drink! I moved on to the Clever Girl (Old Tom Gin, lemon, raspberry, blackberry, vanilla, prosecco). I found it to be a refreshing and festive cocktail. For the rest of our group, the bartender improvised and made a Kentucky Derby with whiskey, raspberry, lemon & soda. It came out strong and super well balanced.Really love the fact that you can taste the quality in every sip of their drinks, plus the food is awesome!Came for brunch at around 1 pm on a Sunday and there was no wait for a table for two outdoors. My boyfriend and I shared the duck hashbrown and fried chicken waffle. I also had a frozen pina colada, which was perfect. Out of the dishes, the waffle was my favorite. Homemade chips were amazing. Next time: I want to try the deviled eggs and more cocktails!This review is so simple to write. Nothing complicated. I just think $15 for a drink with less than a shot of alcohol is absurd. I was so excited to try this place. Yesterday I ordered one of their hot drinks. I'm 5'2, a lightweight, and can easily get tipsy from a glass of wine. I did not feel the alcohol in the drink one bit- just sugar water. Will not be going back as there are too many great bars in the area.  Not that I order drinks to get buzzed, I could have just gotten a tea for $3 somewhere else had I known. (insert emoji shrugging shoulders here).Got delivery from here tonight. Looks like they still have some kinks to work out on the delivery menu/offerings, but it was ...okay. Portions were small- I normally have a very small appetite, but had no problem polishing off their steak frites ($25) and crisps ($8) by myself. Crisps were amazing, the standout of the night. Fries were good and homemade- albeit all fries suffer from delivery. (Photos of both chips and fries taken before any were eaten.) Steak was a great cut, but absolutely abolished by the amount of black pepper on it. Like it made my nose run. I didn't envy my mom and friend's eating situations with their burgers- these were multiple napkin affairs, and my friend gave up after her bun dissolved. Was hoping this would be a place I'd want to head to in person after this mess, but it looks like it's one I may be crossing off the list instead. $100+ tab for 3 with no drinks/desserts, I think my expectations were a bit higher.From what I've read, Clover Club is considered by many to be one of the best cocktail bars in Brooklyn. This past weekend, I also learned it's a fine spot for brunch. And I'm not just saying that because they serve duck hash... okay, maybe I am. That cozy atmosphere extends to brunch as well, as does their list of interesting brunch cocktails, combined with some boozy coffees which made a first drink choice more difficult than I expected. I eventually went with something called an Afternoon Buzz, which was probably a foreshadowing of the rest of my day and evening.The food came out really quickly. The duck hash was not chunks of meat and potato as I might have expected, but more like a giant patty almost the size of the plate, topped with a fried egg and two spicy sauces (I think a sriracha and an aioli) with the colors looking deceptively like they had added strips of bacon on top (such a tease). But a thumbs up on the pancakes, some of the best ones I've had at a restaurant in a long time.While I agree that some spiciness is goodness, that doesn't mean extra spiciness is better. I could have done with a bit less of the sauces to let the flavor of the hash speak for itself (meaning I had to scrape a bit off). My dining companion, who does enjoy her Bloody Mary a bit peppery, also commented that she felt her drink was too peppery. It was great to dine here, and now I'm looking forward to a return visit some evening for more.My partner and I stopped by here the other night because it was cold out and they have hot cocktails on the menu. By the end, we had tried every hot cocktail there was, and they were all delicious. I can't remember their names, but the one with Mezcal was my favorite. We also ordered a steak appetizer and crab dip - so so good! We're looking forward to coming back and having a proper dinner.Beautiful atmosphere, highly recommend for date night/first date. It a big bar yet intimate and quaint with candles on all the tables. They have a very reasonable happy hour that I took full advantage of. This place is elevated bar food, I loved the chips with tangy creme dip. I would discrediting humanity if I don't address their breading pudding. It is ridiculously good. It has a subtle sweetness. Honestly could eat this everyday for a year and be happy. Make room for it!Ooh, I have been here twice in the last few months and have enjoyed myself each time!Loves:+ The drinks. Everything is good. Their booklet is also the cutest drink booklet ever as there are caricatures of the staff inside!+ Food is good. Some of my faves include: mac & cheese ($15), fried chicken ($20), spinach & artichoke dip ($11), and crispy brussel sprouts ($13).+ Their sister restaurant is Leyenda but let me tell you, it feels like 10x easier to hear people in this place.Not so love:- The seats near the door, lol. I wore my winter coat throughout dinner because I was still that cold.Even though this awesome place is in my hood I cannot visit her all the time because I don't always feel like paying $50 for dinner, but when I do feel like having a #treatyoself moment, I know Clover Club is here to help this girl out! :)Fancy drinks with specialty cocktailsOrdered the coconutree holy grailThis place has a Really nice vibeOrdered some food to try The grilled octopus was not that greattoo much beans and not enough octopus to ate Those hot chicken sliders were spicyFelt like it's missing some fries since it's pricey Overall this place is classySo dress nice and be glassyI did an event at Books Are Magic last month and more than one person suggested getting drinks at Clover Club before heading over to the bookstore. I go to a lot of readings and really appreciate a good bar within a short walk of a bookstore. These bars are not only great default hangouts for reading-adjacent events, but they tend to be in fun, walkable areas, and appeal to the exact yipster nerds who voluntarily spend their evenings listening to authors talk about books.We met up at Clover Club at around 5:30 on a rainy Thursday and were able to get a table for five with ease. The place never felt empty, but it stayed pretty calm the whole time we were there. I liked the dim, speakeasyish ambiance and decor--a set-up I've definitely seen before, but one that I tend to enjoy. Service was decent, though I might have ordered a second drink if our waiter had checked on us a little more often.I'm pregnant, so I wasn't really drinking in any case. The cocktails all looked delicious and I watched with envy as my friends drank them. I was happy to find a selection of zero-proof cocktails, at least, and ordered the Before Sunset, a refreshing, sweet and spicy drink with ginger, pineapple, lemon, lime, and jalapeño.Clover Club also has food, so we shared a few snacks, and I got some sliders for an easy dinner. We got the salty and sweet spiced nuts, the deviled eggs, and the spinach artichoke dip for the table. I liked the deviled eggs--there was an assortment of them with different things on top, and I'm not sure which ones I ate, but they were tasty. The spinach artichoke dip was great, served with house tortilla chips. I didn't try the nuts, but I assume they were fine. The hot chicken sliders were solid, with buttermilk and cayenne-marinated chicken finished with herb aioli and house hot sauce.I had a swell time at Clover Club and will probably come back any time I visit Books Are Magic. It's a comfortable bar with nice atmosphere and lots to drink and snack on. Hopefully next time, I'll be able to drink the actual cocktails.Stands the test of time! I'm cringing a little at the review I wrote in my 20s (I was a food critic, apparently), but I'm glad to say that I've never stopped coming to this amazing place!In all the years I've visited, I'm quite sure I've never had a bad drink. My companion, a cocktail fanatic, is totally gaga for this place, it's like a kid in candy store. Always a treat.They got a new food menu somewhat recently and it's excellent! Just the perfect place to go, all around. The staff are so professional, the ambience is so cozy, especially in the winter. What's not to love??Never change, Clover Club!!I came here on Sunday night for dinner and it wasn't busy. The place was very dark and we sat by the window. It's good for dates or large groups. We ordered several cocktails and plates to share. Prices were average. Service needs improvement. Oysters - Overpriced, tiny and very briny. I wouldn't recommend. Spicy PEI Mussels - Delicious. It's not actually spicy in my opinion. The wine broth was so buttery and great for dipping. Don't be afraid to ask for more bread! Crisps with duck fat and truffle creme -Soooo addictive but extremely heavy and greasy. The flavors of duck and fat and truffle were strong and worked very well together. Cocktails - Very good and nicely crafted. My favorite of course was the Clover Club.I came here for a quick drink while waiting for a table at the sister bar across the street. Come here and not there.Their drinks were inventive and great. I thoroughly enjoyed my drinks to the point where I almost missed my table at the other bar as I was taking a long time to savor them. We ordered a quick appetizer of artichoke dip that honestly came with maybe 10 chips. Odd how restaurants think it's normal to eat dip like a soup considering you run out of chips with the first half of the bowl. We asked for more chips and were not told there would be a fee. They sorted it out but it's odd to not let us know about that.  However, the service was great. The host was so nice and accommodating. The space itself has that hipster vibe to it, bar with tiled and wooden accents and speckled with antique-looking functional furniture. Definitely coming back for that matcha cocktail.This place is all around, fantastic! From the service, to the food, to the drinks -- so good. We tried a few things on the menu and all of them were delicious, so anything you choose, you won't go wrong. The mixologist makes great cocktails. The waitress we had was SO kind and delightful! Really just do yourself a favor and go! Can't wait to go back soon. This is definitely a place I would like to go to at least once a month.*Drink review only*Some of the best cocktails you might possibly ever drink can be experienced at Clover Club.I've visited Clover Club several times in the nearly 11 years since it has made Smith Street its home.The décor is very inviting and sexy with a speakeasy feeling allowing it to stand out among other businesses along Smith street. Perfect for a date or hanging with friends.I'm sure I tried some bites when I visited in the past but my memory doesn't serve me well since it has been a while. As such, this review will focus on my recent visit whereupon I enjoyed their incredible cocktails.Although we sat at the bar, there were plenty of tables (albeit occupied) and I think a back space through velvet curtains. Considering it was a Saturday evening, it was super crowded and the place where everyone wanted to be.Because I arrived first, i was able to get acquainted with our bartender of the evening, Ryan, who carefully crafted and curated some of the most visually appealing cocktails (and mocktails) at record speed.It was actually enjoyable sitting at the bar since it was adorned with all the necessary cocktail essentials--variety of bitters, beakers containing an assortment of mixers and a gorgeous herb and fruit/garnish display. Note, Clover Club is fully stocked to include an assortment of whiskeys, gin and vodka according to brand but for those who are beer/wine lovers, they've got you covered.Their cocktail menu was thoughtfully mapped out per category such as Sour drinks, Tiki style drinks, Gin and more.My head spun. That's when I closed the menu and allowed Ryan to decide for me. He was spot on after I told him my preferences--- I started out with the Green Giant drink.  Too pretty to drink, the Green Giant was a combination of Old tom gin, sugar snap peas, tarragon, lemon, dry vermouth. This had the wow factor, served over crushed ice and very refreshing. I typically do not drink Gin but this was a mellow variety and I felt it was necessary to keep the integrity of the drink intact rather than substitute vodka for gin.My next drink was the Sun kissed Sour. Since I was seeking something different sans crushed ice, Ryan suggested this drink especially after I emphasized my fondness for spicy drinks. This was Chili-pepper infused blanco tequila, watermelon, lime, blanc vermouth, pink peppercorn. Between the two cocktails, this might have been my favorite. It was extremely delicious and definitely had that spicy kick to it. My final drink, Gypsy Rose,  was actually a mocktail. As the menu mentioned, at zero proof, it was a combination of Elderflower, strawberry, grapefruit, lime, soda. I'm a huge fan of Elderflower, both the liquor and non alcohol variety. Very smooth and delicious.Some of the other drinks served to us were the Tokyo Drift which was a whiskey cocktail, an Old Fashioned made with Bourbon and a straight single malt whiskey. No complaints with these.As we enjoyed our drinks, the incredible aroma of food, which was brought to tables and those at the bar, looked quite good.Four hours and $120 later, we left satisfied, satiated and imbibed delicious cocktails at Clover Club.Elegant, super chill, wonderful drinks/food make Clover Club a must visit establishment.Absolute winner.I came here for brunch on a cold, rainy day.

It's not actually spicy in my opinion. The wine broth was so buttery and great for dipping. Don't be afraid to ask for more bread! Crisps with duck fat and truffle creme -Soooo addictive but extremely heavy and greasy. The flavors of duck and fat and truffle were strong and worked very well together. Cocktails - Very good and nicely crafted. My favorite of course was the Clover Club.I came here for a quick drink while waiting for a table at the sister bar across the street. Come here and not there.Their drinks were inventive and great. I thoroughly enjoyed my drinks to the point where I almost missed my table at the other bar as I was taking a long time to savor them. We ordered a quick appetizer of artichoke dip that honestly came with maybe 10 chips. Odd how restaurants think it's normal to eat dip like a soup considering you run out of chips with the first half of the bowl. We asked for more chips and were not told there would be a fee. They sorted it out but it's odd to not let us know about that.  However, the service was great. The host was so nice and accommodating. The space itself has that hipster vibe to it, bar with tiled and wooden accents and speckled with antique-looking functional furniture. Definitely coming back for that matcha cocktail.This place is all around, fantastic! From the service, to the food, to the drinks -- so good. We tried a few things on the menu and all of them were delicious, so anything you choose, you won't go wrong. The mixologist makes great cocktails. The waitress we had was SO kind and delightful! Really just do yourself a favor and go! Can't wait to go back soon. This is definitely a place I would like to go to at least once a month.*Drink review only*Some of the best cocktails you might possibly ever drink can be experienced at Clover Club.I've visited Clover Club several times in the nearly 11 years since it has made Smith Street its home.The décor is very inviting and sexy with a speakeasy feeling allowing it to stand out among other businesses along Smith street. Perfect for a date or hanging with friends.I'm sure I tried some bites when I visited in the past but my memory doesn't serve me well since it has been a while. As such, this review will focus on my recent visit whereupon I enjoyed their incredible cocktails.Although we sat at the bar, there were plenty of tables (albeit occupied) and I think a back space through velvet curtains. Considering it was a Saturday evening, it was super crowded and the place where everyone wanted to be.Because I arrived first, i was able to get acquainted with our bartender of the evening, Ryan, who carefully crafted and curated some of the most visually appealing cocktails (and mocktails) at record speed.It was actually enjoyable sitting at the bar since it was adorned with all the necessary cocktail essentials--variety of bitters, beakers containing an assortment of mixers and a gorgeous herb and fruit/garnish display. Note, Clover Club is fully stocked to include an assortment of whiskeys, gin and vodka according to brand but for those who are beer/wine lovers, they've got you covered.Their cocktail menu was thoughtfully mapped out per category such as Sour drinks, Tiki style drinks, Gin and more.My head spun. That's when I closed the menu and allowed Ryan to decide for me. He was spot on after I told him my preferences--- I started out with the Green Giant drink.  Too pretty to drink, the Green Giant was a combination of Old tom gin, sugar snap peas, tarragon, lemon, dry vermouth. This had the wow factor, served over crushed ice and very refreshing. I typically do not drink Gin but this was a mellow variety and I felt it was necessary to keep the integrity of the drink intact rather than substitute vodka for gin.My next drink was the Sun kissed Sour. Since I was seeking something different sans crushed ice, Ryan suggested this drink especially after I emphasized my fondness for spicy drinks. This was Chili-pepper infused blanco tequila, watermelon, lime, blanc vermouth, pink peppercorn. Between the two cocktails, this might have been my favorite. It was extremely delicious and definitely had that spicy kick to it. My final drink, Gypsy Rose,  was actually a mocktail. As the menu mentioned, at zero proof, it was a combination of Elderflower, strawberry, grapefruit, lime, soda. I'm a huge fan of Elderflower, both the liquor and non alcohol variety. Very smooth and delicious.Some of the other drinks served to us were the Tokyo Drift which was a whiskey cocktail, an Old Fashioned made with Bourbon and a straight single malt whiskey. No complaints with these.As we enjoyed our drinks, the incredible aroma of food, which was brought to tables and those at the bar, looked quite good.Four hours and $120 later, we left satisfied, satiated and imbibed delicious cocktails at Clover Club.Elegant, super chill, wonderful drinks/food make Clover Club a must visit establishment.Absolute winner.I came here for brunch on a cold, rainy day. Seating was quick and quarters were tight. The service was fast and, if not friendly, helpful and quick. The food was pretty good although their selection was mostly limited to egg dishes. I had the eggs and gravy dish because they were basically out of everything else I wanted and it was pretty good. I would recommend this place and I would come back but I wasn't totally wowed or anything.My hubby and I threw a baby shower in the beautiful private Parlor Room in the back of the Clover Club and we had a very good experience.Pros:- Beautiful, elegant, and tasteful space with 1800's decor and furnishings. We didn't want to just rent a regular office space and this venue really stood out- No hourly/day space rental fee!- Attentive and friendly staff. We worked with General Manager Justin and Susan with all logistics and they were always responsive. Our bartender Ashley was super outgoing and friendly and my guests all really liked her. - We ordered Deviled Eggs, Cheese Board, Cured Meats, Pulled Pork Minis, Caprese Crostini, Stuffed Mushrooms. All the food was fresh, flavorful and came out in a timely manner. Our friends raved about the Pulled Pork Minis and Caprese Crostini. - Wide variety of fun and delicious cocktails and mocktails. Cons:- The minimum gratuity starts the time your party starts. So if you wanted to order a round of drinks for your friends who helped set up earlier in the morning, that would not count towards the minimum. Our bartender was sweet enough to allow an exception and set it up once she got the bar ready - If anyone wanted to order additional dishes from the regular menu, you have to move out of the Parlor Room and dine in the front dining area, which is frustrating because you don't want to leave the party Details for Parlor Room (Sun-Thurs/Sat Afternoons)- 45 people max capacity for private parties. - The requirement is $300 guaranteed minimum gratuity on all beverages. This means a total bar spend of $1500 assuming guests tip 20%. Drinks can be rung as a cash bar (each guest pays for their own drinks) or open bar (host to pay the entire tab.) At the end of the party, the host must guarantee that the minimum gratuity on all beverages reaches $300 or that the difference is met from cash bar tips. All drinks are rung based on consumption.- Food orders, and signed food contracts are due one week in advance of party. Please note that food is subject to 20% service charge, which does not apply toward the gratuity minimum on beverages.- Saturday & Sunday afternoon events must be cleared by 6pm. You can get there as early as 10:30am to setup. - You cannot use anything that punctures any surface, also no glitter, confetti, stickers, and no duct tape (or equivalent) on any finished wood.- Tall ladder is supplied but not tall enough to reach the ceiling. Tall enough to reach high up on the walls though.- Must supply the source and speakers if you want to play your own music at a reasonable volume.- $25 cake cutting fee covers two small-to-medium-sized cakes or one really big cake. There is no fee for desserts like cupcakes and cookies, and they are happy to arrange them on one of their platters.Food Details- Recommend ordering 2-3 platters of stationary hors d'ouevres, plus the following amount(s) of passed hors d'ouevres. - 4-5 pieces of passed hors d' oeuvres per person is considered light eating. 6-7 pieces per person is considered medium eating. 8-10 pieces per person are considered heavy eating, or enough for each of your guests to call a full meal.   Finally, we ended up spending $1096 for food (medium eating), $115 on bar gratuity difference (in addition to $175 for drinks to treat our friends who helped out). Everything came together, everyone had a grand, well-fed, and drunk time and I highly recommend Clover Club for private parties! Thank you Justin, Susan, Ashley, and staff for helping us host a wonderful and memorable baby shower!I was highly disappointed in this place after seeing the great reviews. I came here for Sunday brunch and we ordered the bacon tasting (really tasty), huervos rancheros (average at best), egg sandwhich (very tasty) and the criossant french toast (very disappointing. had some type of lemon batter. not your typical french toast that you expect).The service was awful. Our waitress was incredible rude the entire time. We were sat with no silverware, brushed off when we asked for milk and sugar for our coffee, and very inattentive. Every time we spoke to her it felt like we were inconveniencing her from her job. Highly disappointing and not a great experience.Stumbled upon the Clover Club around brunch after visiting the amazing bookstore, Books Are Magic.Clover Club's baked eggs were amazing and reasonably priced at $13. The toast was very fresh and great for dipping in the baked eggs.The portion looks small via the photo, but it was a lot more filling than expected. Service was great and very efficient. If I'm in the area I would stop by for brunch again.Nice brunch today. My wife and I both enjoyed our omelettes and our friends also enjoyed their food. Friendly service."

There menu has pretty much Remained the same. They've been able to setup tons of outdoor seating and serve all that food in to go boxes. We ordered (keto friendly) brunch here, and got a bunless burger with bacon, blue cheese, and a fried egg + steak and eggs with a side of salmon. I think because these meals normally come with a bun, fries, etc, ours happened to look small. The burger (although petit) was really good, loved it with the red onion, blue cheese and bacon. The steak and eggs were good too, and the salmon was cooked perfectly. The portions here should've been a bit bigger for a $25 price tag plus $7 for the salmon.Happy to support this local biz that's giving their all to serve our community!My roommate and I made a last minute decision to stop by here for a bite, 10 minutes before their kitchen closed, and we were still seated with a smile. Their drink and cocktail menu is extensive, as well. We ordered two veggie burgers, and let me tell you, they were absolutely delicious. The service is wonderful, too. You truly feel at home here. My cup of water was never left empty, and we were consistently checked on to ensure our needs were being met. I'm so happy this restaurant is open during the COVID-19 pandemic. I will definitely be returning here.Lovely food. Awesome atmosphere. Cozy wam. Home like. Friendly staff. During the covid non sense this place shed some happiness to me! Thanks. Good deal got a yummy kebab meal to go and a $15 bottle of wine!!1 star. Gave one extra bc the manager saved the day-ish.Maybe we were there on an off day? I think it all came down to poor service and mediocre food. We sat down and it took a while for us to get menus. ok. not a big deal. The waiter took our order but never brought us water. He was filling the water on the other tables multiple times. Was it because we ordered drinks? OK. that's not a big deal either. Then the waiting began. The drinks came about 15 min later. Then, after what felt like forever, ONE of 2 of the appetizers came out. We flagged down the waiter to have him check on the order. He said it was coming out soon. It never came. Then, ONE HOUR later, we flagged down the waiter again, and he said the entrees would be out soon. Note, we've been at the restaurant for almost 2 hours at this point and only got drinks and 1 appetizer. During our wait, I noticed TWO tables just walk away because they weren't being serviced.Suddenly, another waiter (probably the manager) noticed something was wrong. He came out and asked us how we were doing and we alerted him about the long wait time. Suddenly, everything was operating like a normal restaurant again. The food came out within the next 10 minutes. We told him one of the appetizers never came so he rushed it out on the house. Now, on to the food. I didn't try the calamari but the persian spiced wings were decent and the drinks were good. They have some inventive cocktails and the flavors are tasty. But on to the entrees - I had asked the waiter if he recommended the persian kabobs or the salmon and he suggested the kabobs, which were honestly terrible. The meat had an odd crumbly texture and the beef tasted a bit.. old? I also tried the pappardelle which had no flavor and dry chicken. It was also COLD.we live in the neighborhood and always walk by the place so we were really excited to try it but alas it was a disappointment.Just left Bijans. And this place was a great find. Came here mid afternoon on a Saturday. Just a table of two Started off with some frozen margaritas-- our server pointed out that they were fresh strawberries. Drinks tasted amazingggg and def we're hitting Also had the lamb burger with feta cheese and sweet potato fries. Boyfriend had the Bijan's burger with feta and fries and we split each burger and shared. Both burgers were amazing. The lamb burger was perfectly seasoned. Like actually the best lamb burger we have had in a while. Great service. Great food. Great service. Will be back  Upset I didn't snag I picture.Went recently had outdoor seating on street which was nice and relaxed. Staff was very friendly and allowed us to bring our dog. Main downside was we were underwhelmed with food. Got truffle fries for $8 which didn't come with a dipping sauce just ketchup packets. Roasted eggplant dip was good but thought the pita chips were overcooked slightly. Best thing was probably the chicken kebab and rice, large portion. Spicy shrimp flatbread was unique but also not sure I'd need to come back to try it again. Overall, good service and atmosphere however food wasn't worth price.While visiting my son in NYC we decided on my last nite in NYC to go for Persian food! I live in Los Angeles and there are 100s Persian restaurant and i was surprised at how hard of a time i had to find them here in NYC! We went to Bijan, I invited my son's girlfriend and her brother as well, by the name of Bijan, and looking through menu I was sure this would be a great way for me to introduce them to my native country food! I ordered kashkeh badenjoon an eggplant appetizer, the one they brought us tasted like eggplants but lacked kashk (cream of whey), i also ordered mast o moosir dish made of yogurt and shallot, ours was yogurt and onions no shallots and tasted horrid! Salad shirazi a salad made of cucumbers, tomatoes, onions in olive oil and lime juice, which tasted somewhat like it tho needed more lime juice and olive oil, for entres i ordered special of the day Gheymeh a dish of meat stew added cinnamon, dried limes and crunchy dried thin french fries! Ours was meat stew w dried limes and actual french fries on top!  I also ordered ground chicken kabob, ground beef kabob and a chicken item from menu which was not a persian dish!  the kabobs ABSOLUTELY did not taste like kabob!! I was so saddened cuz our guests ddnt get to taste wht true persian food tasted!May I I plz i make a suggestion?! Either rename ur dishes to not be Persian name to do justice to the culinary or simply take all persian items out of ur menu, You are doing unjust to our native culinary!! i gave one star for cocktails and service! Overall the WORST Persian food I hav ever tasted:(My party of 2 stopped here for dinner after seeing a show at Barclays center (a little less than a mile away) and we got here around 11 PM on a Thursday and we had about 20 minutes before the kitchen closed.  Everything from the dim lit ambiance to the food was amazing! We ordered the calamari (which was crispy and seasoned well) and the beef stew dinner special and the lamb burger. Both were amazing! We were just happy to find a spot open that late on a weekday for dinner but this place exceeded our expectations! We will definitely be back!Cash only brunch Poor service overall Average food, very basic - served in takeaway plates and plastic so not worth the trip.Serving brunch (until 4PM) and not lunch as advertised until.Had an (very) bad experience and will definitely not come back. I'm all for local restaurants but this place doesn't live up to expectations.Been meaning to visit this neighborhood favorite for a while now and I finally made it for Sunday Brunch. Fist of- they have a fireplace! So cozy to walk in on a cold rainy Sunday. Their decor is rustic and homey. Very welcoming. The tables seemed to be a decent size- not too big or not too small just right for the space.The restaurant offers a prefix menu that comes with either coffee or tea, a drink and an entrée all for the price of $20 which I think is a great deal for this neighborhood. The prefix menu was pretty extensive and very accommodating to vegetarians (as I am). I ordered a coffee, drink called Persian kiss and the Persian omelette. The coffee came first, it was pretty decent, nothing to rave about but also nothing to complain about. The Persian kiss was delightful and in my opinion original as I've never had a proseco with pomegranate juice before. The Persian omelette came with a side salad. I had requested an egg white omelette instead of regular eggs and the restaurant was able to accommodate my request. The omelette was delicious. Just the right amount of sweet and salty as a Persian omelette should be. Side salad was fresh and crunchy just like I like it.Overall a great restaurant and a neighborhood gem.Bijan is sweet spot super close to our place. Usually they have brunch reservation availability on opentable that's where we booked it from. (This could be a one time experience) but seeing the reviews we were really excited to try this place. A little bit disappointed in the service. Our food was ok but overall our experience wasn't great because of our server. She was really rude to us and despite telling her that the table was shaking and she had a number of empty tables she refused to move us and kept leaving without answering any questions or taking any orders. Probably we will revisit this place to try out again!Came by Sunday after church and tried the prix fix brunch menu.I was totally sold.Your meal comes with coffee and a drink. Everything was delicious, we had the bojan cocktail and Persian kiss. To eat we had the two eggs plate and the pancakes.A lovely and warm spot that is about comfort and not spectacle, perfect for a relaxing Sunday brunch experience. In the ever competitive Brooklyn restaurant scene, locally owned and kind places - where the owner is proudly working the floor - might get lost in all the rush of new places with the trendy item du jour and much Insta snapping.Bijan deserves your support for its gentle Persian twist on brunch, its relaxed and friendly service, and Stephanie, the owner, who graciously welcomes you into her home. We were here for Sunday brunch, where $20 gets you a nice entree, coffee or tea, and one cocktail. We had the Persian omelet, with dates inside for a twist, and a tasty two eggs any style with bacon and potatoes. Whole grain and rye toast were immediately brought to the table: the rye was especially good.We had a pomegranate with prosecco and awesome hot toddys - with mint added. Last, but not least, was a fantastic home made tiramisu, at Stephanie's recommendation and with our server's hearty endorsement.In short: Bijan's has good food, fair prices, pleasant service, a relaxing environment, and a proud and lovely local owner. We will definitely be back!Covid Review: They are definitely short staffed and strugggggling, but you know what's free and easy? Good customer service and communication.  If you can't provide a customer with a menu and or say 'I'll be with you in a moment/asap, I'm swamped'...or hell anything at all, you should consider limiting the number of tables you have available - even though you only have 4, sigh. I waited 8 mins for water to come/ a human - then nothing was said, just thrown on the table haha. I understand restaurants want/need you to work with them during covid times, but that doesn't mean consumers just have to accept just anything. I had the Persian Kiss cocktail...too much pomegranate juice and flat prosecco.  Ugh I wanted to like this place maybe I will try again next year, but for now, nah. Also, the online menu prices are wrong FYI. Hope you have a better experience, the food smelled ok, though I over heard a man stating they messed up his order.Stopped by on a rainy day for lunch.  Cute place. Had the lavender vodka cocktail.  Didn't know it was happy hour so that was a nice surprise!  Nice cocktail.Had the Bijan's burger and it's good.  Fries are yummy.The owner was beyond lovely. I enjoyed my steak it was medium cooked and buttery soft and easy to cut loved every bite of it . It was a nice atmosphere not so crazy active street and nice table for two . The owner was so lovely along with the food had an amazing time.4 of us reserved a table for dinner at Bijan's on a Saturday evening. We got given a lovely spot by the window. The restaurant is very cute with lots of plants. Service was very good and smooth. I would have loved the menu to be slightly more Persian but I understand it's only a take on their cuisine. Three of us ordered beef stew of the day with rice and a small tomato salad and my husband took chicken kebab with rice. Everyone's food was very tasty. We also had some pita with 4 dips to nibble on. Perhaps they should work on making those a bit more varied. And their lime/vodka cocktail was one of the best I've ever had. Great little spot for a summer meal. Good for dates also. Will be back.I enjoyed coming here with friends for cocktails, everyone likes their cocktails so a great happy hour spot! I usually enjoy their fries here too especially the ones that come with their burger. The ambience is great though the spot can get crowded depending on when you go.Delicious food, grossly overpriced. We got the Persian noodle soup ($14) and two side dishes of roasted eggplant and garlic yogurt ($7 each) and were very disappointed in the portion size. The soup was super yummy, but small for $14 and the two sides were RIDICULOUS for $7. It was basically robbery, it was almost disrespectful to give such little food and charge so much. Cute place, but probably won't be back due to high prices and small portions despite the food being good.Been here a few times and have never been disappointed. They have excellent cocktails and range of quality food options. The burger was very well prepared and had great flavor. The herb fries are addicting and the wings are delicious."
